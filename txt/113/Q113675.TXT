-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The AppWizard, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using App Studio and running under Windows NT, if the property page for a
resource has the focus and the user switches tasks to another running
application, a General Protection fault will occur within App Studio.

RESOLUTION
==========

Visual C++ version 1.0 for Windows was not developed for use under Windows NT.
To workaround this particular problem, make certain the resource property page
does not have the focus when switching to another application.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This is not a problem in Visual C++, 32-bit Edition.
This problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 1.5.
