The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, 16-bit edition, versions 1.5, 1.51, 1.52 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 4.0, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The MULTICON sample demonstrates how to implement dynamic icons for both
CMDIChildWnd and CMDIFrameWnd windows. The procedure is to first register a
window class with a NULL icon for the frame. A frame of this type receives
WM_PAINT messages when it becomes iconic, and can output to a 36 x 36* pixel
area. To prevent duplicating output code from the view, the frame can call its
view's OnDraw member to do the output.

NOTE: Dynamically animated application icons will not work on Windows 95 and
versions of Windows NT after 3.51.

Two simple view classes are used to demonstrate dynamic icons: CRectView and
CEllipseView. These classes draw a random rectangle and a random ellipse,
respectively. CWinApp::OnIdle is overridden to invalidate each open view and
each minimized frame window. The MULTICON sample also demonstrates how to scale
the output from an open view to fit a minimized frame, and how to convert the
minimized frame's output to an icon during a drag operation.

*For Windows 3.1, subject to change in future versions of Windows.
