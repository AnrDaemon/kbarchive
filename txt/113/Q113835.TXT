TITLE   :MS-DOS Setup Patch Gauge Hangs at 99 Percent
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.21 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install MS-DOS 6.21, Setup attempts to patch your existing DoubleSpace
files to update them for 6.21 and yet still retain the DoubleSpace
functionality.

If the patch contains a valid header signature (FXPF) but the rest of the patch
file is damaged, the system may stop responding (hang) with the patch gauge at
99 percent.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, reboot the system, run uninstall, and obtain
replacement MS-DOS 6.21 disks.

Additional query words: 6.22 6.20 hung frozen locked up lock freeze upgrade DBLSPACE.EX# 99%
