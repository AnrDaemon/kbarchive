The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS, version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the NET USE command to view your current network connections,
Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS displays the status of a network
connection as "Disconnected." However, switching to the drive letter assigned to
that connection shows that a connection does exist. For example:

   Status          Local name      Remote name
   ---------------------------------------------
   Disconnected    D:              \\TEST1\TEST1

   The command completed successfully.

In this example, switching to drive D allows you to perform a directory search
and other functions, proving that a connection with \\TEST1\TEST1 does exist
despite the displayed status.

CAUSE
=====

Ghosted connections are enabled by default when you use the NET START FULL
command and load the full redirector. This means instead of automatically
restoring your previous network connections, Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for
MS-DOS assigns a drive letter to that connection but does not establish the
network connection until you actually try to use it. This helps reduce network
traffic and logon time.

Loading the basic redirector does not enable ghosted connections--actual
connections are made when you log on. The basic redirector is loaded by default.
To change the redirector, type "setup" (without the quotation marks) in the
Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS subdirectory (C:\NET by default), choose
Change Setup Options and then enable the basic or full redirector.
