The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b, 6.1, 6.1a, 6.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a macro contains a comment, the listing file may be incorrectly formatted.
As a result, the comment is printed at the margin rather than being correctly
indented. The example given below illustrates this problem.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) is failing to add the linefeed character
(0Ah) after the carriage return (0Dh).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM versions 6.x. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================


The code sample below generates the following listing (partial):

                                mymacro MACRO aparm
 
; a test macro
 
                                ENDM
 
 
 
                                END
