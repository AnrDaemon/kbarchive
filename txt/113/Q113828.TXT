==========

To correct this problem:

1. Run Audio Control from the Windows Sound System group in Program Manager.

2. Double-click the volume slider switch to display the expanded view.

3. Select the CD option to turn it on. Adjust the slider for the CD option to
   activate volume for CD music.

therefore, a patch wire is not needed.
