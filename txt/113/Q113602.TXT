TITLE   :Less Conventional Memory After Installing MS-DOS 6.21
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.21,6.22

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you install MS-DOS Upgrade version 6.21 or 6.22 on a system using MS-DOS
6.0 DoubleSpace, you may notice a reduction in free conventional memory. If all
the DoubleSpace files are loaded in the upper memory area, you may not
experience this reduction in free conventional memory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have DoubleSpace installed and you install MS-DOS Upgrade over MS-DOS
6.0, DBLSPACE.BIN is modified to give you the equivalent of the MS-DOS 6.2
version of DBLSPACE.BIN. This DBLSPACE.BIN file includes the DoubleGuard and
AutoMount features and therefore uses approximately 7 kilobytes (K) more memory.
Because MS-DOS 6.21 and 6.22 Upgrade Setup cannot update the MS-DOS 6.0
DBLSPACE.SYS to the equivalent of MS-DOS 6.2 DBLSPACE.SYS, the Microsoft
Real-Time Compression Interface (MRCI) libraries cannot be loaded into the high
memory area (HMA). As a result, you are more likely to encounter a reduction in
conventional memory with MS- DOS 6.21 and 6.22 than with MS-DOS 6.2.


WORKAROUND
==========

You can regain approximately 4K of conventional memory by deactivating the
DoubleSpace AutoMount feature. To do so, type "dblspace /automount=0" (without
the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER. If you
do this, you lose the ability to automatically mount compressed removable media
(such as compressed floppy disks).

If you are using an 80386 or higher computer, you can also run MemMaker to
optimize your use of upper memory blocks. Be sure that your CONFIG.SYS file
includes a DEVICE=C:\DOS\DBLSPACE.SYS /MOVE line before you run MemMaker.
