SUMMARY
=======

If you are using third-party shells (instead of using Program Manager), you may
receive general protection (GP) faults or system hangs when you install or use
the Windows Sound System applications.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To change the shell, you must edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

1. From the accessories group start the Notepad application.

2. From the File menu, choose Open.

3. In the File Name box, type the following and press ENTER:

   system.ini

4. Change the SHELL= line to read:

   SHELL=PROGMAN.EXE

If the SHELL= line does not say PROGMAN.EXE, Windows Sound System may not
function properly.
