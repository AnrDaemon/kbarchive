The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2, 3.2a, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the directory synchronization (Dir-Sync) server for Microsoft Mail is
restored from backup, all requestor postoffices must have a full list of
addressees submitted to the Dir-Sync server in order to resynchronize their
address lists with the server's address list.

After the server is restored from a backup copy, the address lists stored
on the server are out of date. There is no mechanism for the server to
request an update from the requestors, and the current structure of Dir-
Sync does not maintain updates on the requestors once the server has
processed them. Therefore, until the requestors perform a Config, Dir-Sync,
Requestor, Export, the server will not receive the requestors' last updates
(updates that occurred immediately before the restore operation). Future
updates will be processed correctly; however, there will be a "hole" in the
server's lists for the missing transactions.
