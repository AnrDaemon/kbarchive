======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1

SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT version 3.1 should run on PCI bus computers if its SCSI and video
adapters are non-PCI or have a PCI driver specifically designed for Windows NT
version 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) standard is a local-bus technology that
is becoming increasingly common in new desktop computers. A blueprint or
specification rather than something physical, it is a method of holding together
PC components--the processor, memory, hard disk, etc.--that makes PCI computers
and peripherals differ from other computers and peripherals currently
available.

The March 1994 Windows NT Version 3.1 hardware compatibility list includes a
number of PCI bus computers. In general, Windows NT 3.1 should work on PCI
computers. The current Windows NT hardware abstraction layer (HAL) does not
support PCI functionality, but should allow Windows NT to run in a mode that is
ISA/EISA compatible.

If an adapter is working under Windows NT 3.1, it probably is running in a
non-PCI or ISA/EISA compatible mode. Problems are most likely to arise with PCI
adapters rather than PCI computers.

Support Issues for PCI Adapters
-------------------------------

1. PCI computers should work with any adapter on the Windows NT hardware
   compatibility list (HCL).

2. Some, but not many, vendors are including PCI adapters in their PCI
   computers. To work with Windows NT 3.1, the adapter must include a Windows NT
   3.1 PCI driver, and any driver support issues must be referred to the
   manufacturer. Presently there are no PCI adapters or peripherals on the
   Windows NT 3.1 HCL.


3. OEM Windows NT 3.1 PCI drivers do not enable Windows NT to support PCI
   functionality--they simply allow the PCI adapter to function in an ISA/EISA
   compatible mode, so it may work under Windows NT. Again, there are no plans
   to support PCI functionality under Windows NT 3.1.


4. PCI video adapters should work with Windows NT 3.1 because most of the calls
   work with standard video BIOS.


5. SCSI adapters may or may not work depending on the manufacturer's
   implementation.
