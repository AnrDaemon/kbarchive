TITLE   :Err Msg After Installing MS-DOS 6.21: Wrong DBLSPACE.BIN...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.21,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install MS-DOS 6.21 Upgrade on your MS-DOS 6.0 system, you receive the
following error message when you start your computer:

   Wrong DBLSPACE.BIN version

In addition, DBLSPACE.SYS may display the following message:

   You cannot access any DoubleSpace drives because DBLSPACE.BIN is not loaded.
   (DBLSPACE.BIN is the portion of MS-DOS that provides access to
   DoubleSpace-compressed drives.)

If you have compressed any drives using DoubleSpace, you cannot access the data
on those drives.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when MS-DOS 6.21 Upgrade Setup is unable to patch your
DBLSPACE.BIN, DBLSPACE.EXE, and DBLSPACE.SYS files.

The Upgrade Setup program can patch your DBLSPACE.* files only if you are running
MS-DOS 6.0 at the time you run Setup. If you boot from the MS-DOS 6.21 disk
before running Setup, the DBLSPACE.* files cannot be patched.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, boot your system from your Uninstall disk and restore
your system to MS-DOS version 6.0. Then boot your computer from the hard disk
drive using MS-DOS 6.0 and rerun MS-DOS 6.21 Upgrade Setup.

If you do not have your Uninstall disk, boot from your MS-DOS 6.0 Disk 1, press
F3 to exit the Setup program, and then rerun MS-DOS 6.21 Upgrade Setup.

If you do not have your Uninstall disk and your MS-DOS 6.0 Disk 1 does not fit in
drive A, insert your MS-DOS 6.0 Disk 1 in drive B and run B:\SETUP /F. Follow
the instructions on the screen to create an MS-DOS 6.0 startup floppy disk in
drive A. After completing the SETUP /F, boot from the Startup disk and rerun
MS-DOS 6.21 Upgrade Setup.
