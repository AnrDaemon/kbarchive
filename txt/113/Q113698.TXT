TITLE   :PRB: Command Window Moves Behind Main FoxPro Window
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.5b,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.5b 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When MACDESKTOP = ON, clicking the main FoxPro window moves it in front of the
Command window.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Command window is not a part of the main FoxPro
window as it is in both FoxPro for Windows and FoxPro for MS-DOS. Issuing the
SET MACDESKTOP OFF command after FoxPro has started does not affect this
relationship because the "desktop" state of the Command window is determined
prior to the execution of any user code.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you want the Command window to behave as it does in FoxPro for Windows and
FoxPro for MS-DOS, add the following line to the CONFIG.FPM file:

      MACDESKTOP = OFF

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
