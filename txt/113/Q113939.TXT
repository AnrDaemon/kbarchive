TITLE   :PRB: Setup Toolkit DoMsgBox Shows Wrong Buttons or Icons
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Only the MB_OK, MB_ICONHAND, and MB_TASKMODAL styles are recognized in the
wType% parameter. Any additional styles are ignored and the message box will
only show the OK button.

CAUSE
=====

Only the MB_OK, MB_ICONHAND, and MB_TASKMODIAL constants are defined in
SETUPAPI.INC. Although DoMsgBox() can use all the constants described in the
Microsoft Windows 3.1 SDK under the MessageBox() function, these constants are
not defined in SETUPAPI.INC and hence are ignored in the call to DoMsgBox().

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify SETUPAPI.INC to include definitions of the missing style constants or
pass the numerical value in the wType% parameter rather than the SDK constant.

Below is a list of all of the possible styles you can specify in the wType%
parameter of the DoMsgBox() function. Cut and paste the needed constants into
your SETUPAPI.INC file.

CONST MB_OK                = 0
CONST MB_OKCANCEL          = 1
CONST MB_ABORTRETRYIGNORE  = 2
CONST MB_YESNOCANCEL       = 3
CONST MB_YESNO             = 4
CONST MB_RETRYCANCEL       = 5

CONST MB_ICONHAND          = 16
CONST MB_ICONQUESTION      = 32
CONST MB_ICONEXCLAMATION   = 48
CONST MB_ICONASTERISK      = 64

CONST MB_ICONINFORMATION   = 64
CONST MB_ICONSTOP          = 16

CONST MB_DEFBUTTON1        = 0
CONST MB_DEFBUTTON2        = 256
CONST MB_DEFBUTTON3        = 512

CONST MB_APPLMODAL         = 0
CONST MB_SYSTEMMODAL       = 4096
CONST MB_TASKMODAL         = 8192
