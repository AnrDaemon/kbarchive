TITLE   :PC Win: MMF Recovery Can Cause Missing Message Body
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0b,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Mail message file (MMF) Recovery utility built into versions 3.0b and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows causes messages that have been copied to multiple
folders to lose their message bodies, including any attachments. A copy of the
message with the text intact will be saved in the "Lost and Found" folder
created by the recovery process; however, all attachments will be lost.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design; the loss of these attachments is due to the structure of the
.MMF file. You should only use the MMF Recovery utility if .MMF file corruption
is evident. The utility is not designed to be used on working .MMF files that
exhibit no signs of corruption.
