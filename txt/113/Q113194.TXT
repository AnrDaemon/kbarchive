TITLE   :PC Win: Err Msg: An Error...Loading the Spelling Library
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use universal naming convention (UNC) style paths to refer to the
locations of spelling libraries in the WIN.INI file, the following error message
appears:

   An error occurred while loading the spelling library

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Office products (such as Microsoft Excel and Word) enable you to use
UNC paths to refer to the locations of their spelling libraries. Microsoft Mail
does not have this functionality.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Add the following line to the [MS Proofing Tools] section of the WIN.INI file
   to provide Mail with a local path to the spelling libraries:

   Spelling(mail) 1033,0=C:\WINDOWS\MSAPPS\PROOF\MSSPEL2.DLL,
   C:\WINDOWS\MSAPPS\PROOF\MSSP2_EN.LEX

   NOTE: This should be typed as a single line.

2. Modify the "Spelling=Spelling 1033,0" line in the [MS Proofing Tools] section
   of the MSMAIL.INI file to read as follows:

   Spelling=Spelling(mail) 1033,0

Another workaround is to maintain a persistent connection to the server that
contains the spelling libraries, and modify the WIN.INI file to point to the
drive letter this connection uses. In the following example, a persistent
connection has been established using drive E:

   Spelling 1033,0=E:\MSSPEL2.DLL,E:\MSSP2_EN.LEX

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
