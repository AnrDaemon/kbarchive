SUMMARY
=======

Versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows have a menu that allows you
to select the type of file you want to attach to a mail message. To access this
menu, compose a message and select the Attach button. The Attach dialog box
appears on the screen with the List Files of Type list box in the lower-left
corner. When you select the drop-down list box, various file types are listed.
Some of these file types, such as MS Word Documents (*.DOC), have descriptions
that are too long to be viewed in their entirety. This drop-down list box cannot
be resized to accommodate the longer descriptions.
