======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows versions 1993 edition, 1994 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

QuickShelf in Bookshelf 1994 or QuicKeys in Bookshelf 1993 may miss some
keystrokes. For example, when you use a QuicKey combination to look up a item,
you may need to type the key combination twice before Bookshelf gets activated.
It may also take more than one attempt to restore QuickShelf or QuicKeys with a
quick key combination if you have minimized it.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Bookshelf 1993 and 1994
editions. This problem was corrected in the 16-bit version of Bookshelf, 1995
edition.

NOTE: Microsoft Bookshelf 95 for Windows 95 (32-bit) does not use QuicKey
combinations; this problem does not apply.
