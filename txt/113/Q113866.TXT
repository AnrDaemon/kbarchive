TITLE   :Long Filenames Appear Incorrect in File Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Macintosh client performs a tree copy from the Macintosh to a Microsoft
Windows NT Advanced Server running Services for Macintosh (SFM), and then
another tree copy from the SFM volume to another tree on an SFM volume, the long
filenames of the final destination tree are converted to 8.3 names as displayed
in WinFile. Source files in this operation contain trailing periods or spaces in
their name.

When you view the destination tree from a command prompt or from the Macintosh
client, the filenames are correct.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Advanced Server
version 3.1. This problem was corrected in Windows NT version 3.5.
