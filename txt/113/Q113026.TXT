TITLE   :PPT: Text Format Lost When Promoting, Demoting Paragraph
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:3.0,4.0; WINDOWS:3.0,4.0,7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh, versions 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you change the indent level of a paragraph, it takes on the formatting
defined on the Slide Master for that indent level. For example, if you demote or
promote a paragraph to a third-level indent, the text in the paragraph will
adopt the formatting defined on the Slide Master for all third-level indented
paragraphs. Any custom text formatting you previously applied to the paragraph
will be lost.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. It is intended to assist in the creation of
professional-looking presentations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The formatting of the text in the Object Area for AutoLayout (Master Body in
PowerPoint 3.0) determines what text formatting will be used by default at each
level of indentation in the object placeholders (body in PowerPoint 3.0) on the
slide.

The same behavior also appears when you demote or promote text in the body of the
Notes pages. In this case, the formatting is controlled by the formatting on the
Notes Master.
