TITLE   :PC Ext: External 3.2 Decrements Retry Count
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the External Mail program included with version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks, any of the following modem return codes decrement the mail retry
counter:

   3 - NO CARRIER
   4 - ERROR
   6 - NO DIALTONE
   7 - BUSY
   8 - NO ANSWER

A new return code, 9 - DIAL_REJECT, has been implemented that does not decrement
the reject counter when it is returned by the modem script. If this code is
returned, the External Mail program will continue trying to send the message
until the useful life of the message has been exceeded.

CAUSE
=====

In versions of Mail earlier than 3.2, a return code of 3, 4, 6, or 7 decrements
the retry counter, while 8 does not.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the modem script to use return code 9, and therefore not decrement the
counter. For example, if one of the External Mail programs in the Mail system is
often busy, make the following change to ensure that mail is not rejected
unnecessarily. (The following example is taken from the HAYES24.MDM script; this
modification is similar in all scripts.)

Change the following

      else if (response = "7^M")

                {
                display ">>> BUSY <<<"
                $ret = 7             ; busy
                }

to:

      else if {response = "7^M"}

                {
                display ">>> BUSY <<<"
                $ret = 9
                }
