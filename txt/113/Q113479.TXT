======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you load the real-mode portion of the Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11
network, you receive the following error message:

   Error 3: The specified path was not found.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs after you upgrade Microsoft Workgroups Connections 1.0 to
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 if the Workgroups Connections directory is listed
before the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 directory in the PATH statement in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

RESOLUTION
==========

 - Change the PATH statement so that the Windows for Workgroups directory comes
   before the Workgroups Connections directory. For example, change

      PATH=C:\DOS;C:\WINDOWS;...   --->WORKGROUP CONNECTIONS 1.0

   to:

     PATH=C:\WINDOWS;C:\DOS;...   --->WINDOWS FOR WORKGROUPS 3.11

   NOTE: The above error message persists if you issue the NET command from the
   Workgroups Connections directory.

   -or-

 - Remove the Workgroups Connections installation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Workgroups Connections NET.EXE command parses the CONFIG.SYS file for the
location of the PROTOCOL.INI file and cannot locate it since PROTMAN.DOS no
longer loads from the CONFIG.SYS file.
