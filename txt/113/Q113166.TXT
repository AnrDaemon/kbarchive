KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

In version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, the following error message
may appear when you try to run the MOVEUSER.EXE utility to move a user from one
postoffice to another.

   Moving user '<UserName>' failed.

CAUSE
=====

One possible cause of this error is a missing or renamed Mail message file
(MMF). The MOVEUSER utility extracts the location information for the placement
of the MMF (either local or server). To successfully run MOVEUSER, the MMF must

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, copy or restore the user's MMF to the MMF subdirectory
of the Mail database.
