======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Microsoft Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) and you select
Admin, Folder, Compress to compress folders, the following error message may
appear:

   Notice 158 : Folder in use, they were not compressed.
   Run Foldcomp -s if this persists.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a semaphore lock on a folder file.

RESOLUTION
==========

The folder that remains on the screen when the Mail Administrator program
displays the Notice 158 error is not necessarily the subdirectory in which the
FOLDCOMP -S command needs to be performed.

If the error persists after you run FOLDCOMP -S on the subdirectory displayed,
run the FOLDCOMP -S command on all folder subdirectories.
