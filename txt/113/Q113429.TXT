TITLE   :FIX: C1001: coff.c, Line 280, new of __declspec(dllimport)
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCompiler kbCPPonly kbVCkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE) 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The compiler generates the following internal compiler error message when the
sample program below is compiled:

   fatal error C1001: INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR
   (compiler file '@(#)coff.c:1.14', line 280)

The internal compiler error is triggered by the code, which does a new of an
array of a class that is marked __declspec(dllimport).

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid the error, remove the __declspec(dllimport) from the class declaration
and link with an import library instead.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
beginning of this article. The problem was corrected in Visual C++, 32-bit
edition, version 2.0.

Sample Code
-----------

   /* Compile options needed: /c
   */ 

   class __declspec(dllimport) CImport
   {
   public:
       CImport();
       ~CImport();
   };

   class CMyClass
   {
   protected:
       CImport * piArray;
   public:
       CMyClass() {piArray = new CImport[2];}
       ~CMyClass() {delete[] piArray;}
   };
