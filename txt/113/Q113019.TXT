The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0

SUMMARY
=======

You cannot change the default Fit Text or Anchor Point options in PowerPoint.
Shape objects, labels, and text boxes will always have the same standard,
default object attributes when you first create them.

The default settings for these objects are as follows:

   Object Type    Anchor Point Type     Adjust Size?    Word-wrap?
   -----------    -----------------     ------------    ----------

   Shape               Middle                No             No
   Label                Top                  Yes            No
   Text box             Top                  Yes            Yes

NOTE: The Fit Text option is available in PowerPoint 3.0, and the Anchor Point
option is available in PowerPoint 4.0.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The Fit Text and Anchor Point commands allow you to change, for the selected
object(s), the following object attributes:

   Anchor Point
   Box Margins
   Adjust Object Size to Fit Text
   Word-wrap Text in Object

WORKAROUND
==========

If you need to create several objects with attributes that differ from the
standard defaults, you can make this task easier by using either of the two
following workarounds:

Workaround 1
------------

If you have created an object that has the object attributes that you want, you
can use the Pick-up Style and Apply Style tools (version 3.0) or the Format
Painter tool (version 4.0) to copy those attributes to other objects.

The drawback to this method is that all other object attributes are copied as
well, such as fill color, line style, and so on.

Workaround 2
------------

1. Create an object and change its attributes as desired, using the Fit Text or
   Anchor Point command.

2. Use the Copy and Paste commands (or the Duplicate command) to make as many
   copies of that object as you need with those attributes.

3. Make any additional changes to the copies.
