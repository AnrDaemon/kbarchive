MORE INFORMATION
================

This update corrects the following problems:

 - When multiple Mail for PC Networks postoffices have similar network and
   postoffice names, the Schedule Distribution program (Schdist.exe) may not
   fully validate the entire <network>\<postoffice> name address to
   which the free/busy times are addressed.

 - Trap D errors occur under OS/2 after Schedule+ processes two non- Schedule+
   messages.

 - Trap D errors occur under OS/2 or under the OS/2 subsystem of Windows NT
   while the Admin.prf file is being updated.

 - The program fails to apply changes from PowerCore's Schedule/DOS on the third
   request.

 - The Schdist.exe program does not import free/busy times via an SMTP gateway.
   The line length for word wrapping is too long for Schedule Distribution
   messages and, as a result, some encapsulated gateways rewrap the message.
   This causes the Schdist program to reject the message because of an improper
   format. The line length previously set at 82 (80 characters of data plus 2
   characters for the terminator) was changed to 78.

NOTE: If Schedule+ is interacting with the IBM PROFS calendar system, version
3.4a of the PROFS Host should be used. Version 3.4 of the PROFS Host still wraps
messages at 80 characters and will not function with this new version of
Schdist.exe. After you download Schdupd.exe to a new folder, run it (by typing
"schdupd" at the MS-DOS prompt) to extract the contents of the file. You should
receive the following files:

To Update Your Schdist.exe File
-------------------------------

At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

   copy <path>:\schdist.exe <destination>

where <path> is the drive and folder where you ran the self- extracting
Schdupd.exe file and <destination> is the drive and folder where your
Schdist.exe file currently resides. For example, if you ran the self- extracting
file from the TEST folder on drive D, and your Schdist.exe file is located in
the Mailexe folder on drive C, type the following command:

   copy d:\test\schdist.exe c:\mailexe

NOTE: Schdist.exe typically resides on the computer dedicated to performing
schedule distribution. The Schedule+ Install.exe program places Schdist.exe in
the path specified for the Admin files during installation. The default path is
to the Adminsch folder on drive C of the computer where Install.exe is executed.
Schdist.exe can also be installed to the postoffice server in the Mail
executables folder. Make sure you update all copies of Schdist.exe.
