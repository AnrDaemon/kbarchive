TITLE   :NTBACKUP Doesn't Create Set Description from Command Line
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install U.S. Service Pack 2, the Windows NT Backup program (NTBACKUP)
no longer creates a set description when you start it from the command line. For
example, if you type the following and then press ENTER

   NTBACKUP backup C:\DOS /D "TEST"

NTBACKUP does not create the set description of TEST. Instead, it leaves the set
description blank on the tape.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because quotation marks are not handled correctly.

STATUS
======

Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S.
