TITLE   :Err Msg: "Access Denied" on Backup or Update of RAS Temp File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Remote Access Service (RAS) Server is running, and you attempt to either
backup the root directory using NTBackup or update the Emergency Repair Disk
using REPAIR.EXE from the Windows NT 3.1 Resource Kit, the following error
message appears:

   Copy %systemroot%\System32\RAS41766.TEM

   Access Denied.

   Abort or Retry.

CAUSE
=====

The RAS Server initialization code creates the temporary file RAS41766.TEM in
the %systemroot%\System32 directory when starting RAS and deletes it when RAS is
stopped. The location for this temporary file is not user selectable. When you
perform a disk backup or an update to the Emergency Repair Disk, Windows NT
tries to access this file. Because Windows NT security only allows access to
this file by the RAS Server initialization code (the file's parent process),
NTBACKUP.EXE or REPAIR.EXE are denied access resulting in the above error.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, stop RAS before attempting to backup your disk with
NTBackup or update the Emergency Repair Disk.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem has been corrected in Windows NT
Workstation and Windows NT Server version 3.5.
