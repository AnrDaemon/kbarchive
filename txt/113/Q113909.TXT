TITLE   :NTBACKUP Creates Additional Backup Set Description File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you update Windows NT to Service Pack 2 and back up a network drive from the
MS-DOS command prompt, the Windows NT Backup program (NTBACKUP) creates a second
backup set description file. For example, if from drive C you run

   NTBACKUP BACKUP H: /R /D "Backup" /L "C:\Backup.log"

where H is the logical network drive, two backup set description files are
created: one for drive H and one for drive C. The file for drive C contains no
information.

CAUSE
=====

The filename for BACKUP.LOG (specified for the network drive on drive C) is
incorrectly parsed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To create only one backup set for the logical network drive, remove this
parameter from the command:

   /L "C:\Backup.log"

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S.
Service Pack for Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1. For
