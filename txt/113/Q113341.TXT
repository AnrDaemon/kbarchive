SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft provides a replacement for the MSRMTSU.DLL that is included with
version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This update contains MSRMTSU.DLL, a replacement for the MMSRMTSU.DLL file that
is included with version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows. This
replacement file provides additional enhancements to the original MSRMTSU.DLL
file, correcting the following problems:

 - When you use Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows to connect to a postoffice and
   you attempt to switch to the Mail Remote driver with MAILDRV.EXE, the
   following error message may occur:

   Mailbox ID not Found: <userid>

 - A message remaining in the Outbox could be misdirected if the remote address
   book was updated without uploading messages. The client will now check for
   the outbound messages prior to updating the address book. To ensure this fix
   works correctly, the following DLLs must be upgraded in conjunction with this
   DLL:

      MSRMT.DLL    version 3.2.4013
      MSRMTCN.DLL  version 3.2.4013
      MSRMTTR.DLL  version 3.2.4013
      MSRMTUI.DLL  version 3.2.4013

(without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt) to extract the contents of
the file. You should receive the following files:

To replace your MSRMTSU.DLL file
--------------------------------

1. Verify that the Microsoft Mail Remote driver (MSRMT.DLL) is the current
   driver in the Mail System Selector (MAILDRV.EXE) by running the Mail System
   Selector from the Windows Program Manager, choosing Microsoft Mail Remote,
   and then selecting Set As Current Mail Driver.

2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

   " copy <path>:\msrmtsu.dll <destination> " (without the quotation
   marks)

   where <path> is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
   extracting MSRMTSU.EXE file and <destination> is the drive and
   directory where your MSRMTSU.DLL file currently resides. For example, if you
   ran the self-extracting file from the TEST directory on drive D, and your
   MSRMTSU.DLL file is located in the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory on drive C,
   type the following command:

   " copy d:\test\msrmtsu.dll c:\windows\system " (without the quotation marks)
