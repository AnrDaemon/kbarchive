PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the External Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE) cannot deliver mail to an .MAI
file, the following error message appears:

   Retry count exceeded

The External Mail program generates this error after it has tried to deliver a
message three times. It takes approximately 16 minutes to make the three
attempts. If the file remains locked, the External Mail program's copy of the
message is destroyed. You can tell this problem has occurred by looking in the
sending postoffice's SESSION.LOG and SYSTEM.LOG files for "Retry Count Exceeded"
and "Missing Message File" messages.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks. This problem was corrected in version 3.2a (which includes
EXTERNAL.EXE version 3.2.9).
