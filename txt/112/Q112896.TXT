TITLE   :PC Rmt: Remote Postoffice List Only Contains Local Addresses
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for MS-DOS, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail Remote for MS-DOS, the postoffice list will not
contain external postoffice users, even if the Mail administrator has added
external postoffice users to the postoffice list.

CAUSE
=====

The Regenerate command is displayed after you select the Remote command in the
Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE). The Regenerate command creates a file
called RNETWORK.GLB, which contains the default user list for a Remote Mail
user. When external postoffice users are added to the postoffice list, they are
added to the ADMIN.NME file. The regenerate process looks at the ACCESS2.GLB
file rather than the ADMIN.NME file. Therefore, only local users appear in the
postoffice list of the MS-DOS Remote client.

RESOLUTION
==========

To view external postoffice users, choose Postoffice Network List and then
select the postoffice for which you want the list of external addresses. Note
that the current postoffice users and the external postoffice users will not be
part of the same list.
