The ADT provides a run-time version of Microsoft Access 2.0 and tools to assist

Access 2.0 is not included with the ADT, but can be purchased separately.

The ADT includes a run-time version of Microsoft Graph for distributing graphs
and charts with applications, the Microsoft Windows Help compiler for creating
custom Help files, and a Setup Wizard for creating customized Setup programs.

can be copied and pasted directly into applications.

Detailed technical documentation and customization tools are provided, including
the Access Basic "Language Reference" manual, and the "Advanced Topics" manual
that addresses client/server development, connecting to external data sources,
and using data access objects (DAO). In addition, there are sample OLE controls
including Calendar, Scroll bar and Data Outline controls.
