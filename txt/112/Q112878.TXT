TITLE   :PC WSPlus: Sched. Dist. Doesn't Propagate Free and Busy Times
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER::1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Schedule Distribution application across an SMTP (or PROFS/OV
version 3.4) gateway, the free and busy times on the postoffices at either side
of the gateway do not propagate. The following error message appears in the
Schedule Distribution log file:

   Could not process message

CAUSE
=====

The line length in the free and busy time messages is too long for Schedule
Distribution. When the lines are wrapped, the messages become illegible.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 1.0 and 1.0a of
Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows. This problem was corrected in SCHDIST.EXE
version 1.0a.2. If you do not have version 1.0a.2 (or later), a self-extracting
file is available for download.
