SUMMARY
=======

The TEXT sample demonstrates how to display and print text using a CScrollView
derived class. It is possible to implement text output in a CScrollView class by
overriding OnDraw and drawing the entire document using TextOut. However,
further steps are required to draw the text efficiently and to include support
for multipage documents. Here are the features implemented in this sample and
the locations:

Feature                                        Locations(s)
-------                                        ------------

Calculation of various metrics necessary       METRICS.CPP:
for text output:                               CViewMetrics::Compute

Optimized screen and printer output for        TEXTVIEW.CPP:
multipage documents:                           OnDraw (two overrides)
                                               OnPrint
                                               ComputeVisibleLines
                                               ComputePrintableLines

Calculation of page count:                     METRICS.CPP:
                                               CPageMetrics::Compute

Visual indication of pagination:               METRICS.CPP (Calculation)
                                               CPageMetrics::IsPageBreak

                                               TEXTVIEW.CPP (Display)
                                               OnDraw
                                               DrawPageBreak

User-defined margins:                          METRICS.CPP (Calculation)
                                               CMargins::Compute

                                               METRICS.CPP (Validation)
                                               CMargins::IsInvalid

                                               TEXTVIEW.CPP (Display)
                                               OnPrint

Loading text files into a document:            TEXTDOC.CPP
                                               OnOpenDocument
