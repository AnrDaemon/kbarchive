PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you provide Novell NetWare 4.x client software earlier than WINUP9.EXE when
you install Windows for Workgroups 3.11, the correct .DLL files may not be
copied.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows for Workgroups 3.11 NetWare 4 installation code was written with the
assumption that the current NetWare 4.x client files are provided in WINUP8.EXE.
WINUP9.EXE contains a different list of files and includes a new .DLL.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, install the WINUP9.EXE files, and then install
Windows for Workgroups version 3.11. (Be sure to select NetWare version 4
support.)

MORE INFORMATION
================

The correct .DLL files are copied over if you install Windows for Workgroups
3.11 under the following scenarios:

 - You are using WINUP8.EXE files.

 - You were running WINUP9.EXE with Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.1
   and then upgraded to Windows for Workgroups 3.11.

 - You were using WINUP8.EXE files, upgraded to Windows for Workgroups 3.11, and
   then installed the WINUP9.EXE files manually.

 - You were running DOSUP8.EXE files, upgraded to Windows for Workgroups 3.11,
   and provided the WINUP8.EXE files as requested by Windows for Workgroups
   Setup.
