TITLE   :Printing Screen Snapshots in FoxPro for Macintosh
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.5b 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In FoxBASE+ for the Macintosh, you can print a screen snapshot by choosing Print
from the File menu. However, this functionality is not available in FoxPro for
Macintosh.

CAUSE
=====

The File Print command in FoxPro for Macintosh prints text information in a
single window only. A screen shot contains graphic images of multiple windows,
which cannot be printed through FoxPro for Macintosh. This behavior is by design
to ensure cross-platform compatibility in FoxPro, which can be run in either a
character- or graphics-based operating system. FoxPro relies on underlying
operating system functionality or third-party add-ins in order to print screen
shots.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, you can print a screen snapshot using the
Macintosh screen snapshot feature, as follows:

1. With the desired image on the screen, press COMMAND+SHIFT+3. A TeachText PICT
   file will be created. The first screen snapshot will be named Picture 1; the
   filename will be incremented by 1 for each successive picture. The file will
   be created in the root folder of the current default volume (drive).

2. Return to the desktop and double-click the icon for the screen snapshot.
   TeachText will open. From the File menu in TeachText, choose Print to print
   the snapshot.

NOTE: You can also print the snapshot from other applications, such as Microsoft
Word for the Macintosh, that support the PICT file format.
