TITLE   :Err Msg with CorelDRAW: Not Enough Disk Space to Save...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1 3.5 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51

SYMPTOMS
========

When you save a file in CorelDRAW, one of the following error messages may
appear

   Not enough disk space to save file x:\< filename >

   -OR-

   Error writing x:\< filename >

where x is a drive location.

CAUSE
=====

CorelDRAW saves files with an image header. The image header can be 8K, 4K, 2K,
1K, or zero in size. The image header provides preview functionality to the file
and different sizes give higher or lower resolutions to the bitmap image that is
used for the preview. The problem is that with trying to save the file with an
8K or 4K color image header, CorelDRAW attempts to write the header file
information directly to the video adapter first. Windows NT does not allow
programs to directly access hardware. The file cannot be saved and one of the
above error messages appears.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, save the file with an image header of None, 1K, or
2K in size.

CorelDRAW is manufactured by Corel Corporation, a vendor independent of
Microsoft. We make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
