SUMMARY
=======

The REDISTRB.WRI file included with Visual C++ 32-bit Edition lists those files
that can be legally redistributed with applications created with Visual C++ for
Windows NT. The REDISTRB.WRI file does not list MSVCRT10.DLL; however, this file
is also legally redistributable.

MSVCRT10.DLL is needed by applications that have been built to use the
dynamic-link library (DLL) version of the C run-time library. It is legal for
registered owners to redistribute MSVCRT10.DLL with applications created with
Visual C++ for Windows NT.

MSFRT10.DLL shipped with Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation 32 for Windows NT,
version 1.0 is also redistributable. This DLL contains the dynamic-link library
version of the FORTRAN run-time library.

Additional query words: FPSNT 1.00
