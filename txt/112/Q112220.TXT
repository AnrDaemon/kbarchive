TITLE   :PRB: System Resources Not Released While in FoxPro
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5,2.5a,2.5b,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

As you work in FoxPro for Windows, the amount of available system resources
(User, System, and GDI memory) initially decreases. These system resources do
not return to their original levels until after you have exited FoxPro.

CAUSE
=====

FoxPro for Windows stores colors, pen types, font information, and brushes in
memory. This is to make these items available as you are working. These items
are swapped in and out of memory as necessary. Therefore, the memory decrease
you may see during a FoxPro session relates more to caching than memory loss.

NOTE: Even after exiting FoxPro for Windows, you may notice that GDI resources
are lower than they were before FoxPro was loaded. This is not necessarily a
problem with FoxPro. Some GDI objects may remain in memory even after a
Windows-based application is closed. This means that a portion of the GDI heap
may be lost until you restart Windows itself.
