TITLE   :The Unexpected QuickWin Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1

KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Applications for Microsoft Windows developed with the Windows SDK may display an
error message box with the error:

   "Unexpected QuickWin Error"

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are several possible causes for this error:

 - A QuickWin application caused an unexpected application error (UAE) or
   general protect (GP) fault.

- or -

 - A Microsoft Windows-based application that is not a QuickWin application
   called a QuickWin function. If execution of a non-QuickWin application for
   Windows results in this error, one of the QuickWin functions was linked and
   executed in the application.

- or -

 - Possible mismatch of memory model libraries (for example, building a large
   model application but using SLIBCEW, the small model library for Windows.)

- or -

 - Possible stray function pointers that accidentally call one of the QuickWin
   stubs.

- or -

 - You may have attempted to use an invalid file handle with one of the I/O
   functions.

The run-time libraries for Windows (SLIBCEW, MLIBCEW, CLIBCEW, and LLIBCEW)
contain stubs to the QuickWin functions. Therefore, the linker will not give an
error when linking with a QuickWin function from a non-QuickWin application for
Windows. However, when the function executes, an error message box with the
error "Unexpected QuickWin Error" will be displayed.

The following functions are in the QuickWin library:

   _fwopen                    _wgopen
   _inchar                    _wgsetactive
   _wabout                    _wmenuclick
   _wclose                    _wopen
   _wgclose                   _wsetexit
   _wgetexit                  _wsetfocus
   _wgetfocus                 _wsetscreenbuf
   _wgetscreenbuf             _wsetsize
   _wgetsize                  _wyield
   _wggetactive

For further information regarding QuickWin applications and the QuickWin
routines, refer to the Language Help file of Visual C++ or the Microsoft Visual
C++ "Run-Time Library Reference" manual.
