======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1x, 3.0, 3.0a, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under versions 2.1x, 3.0, 3.0a, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, when
you access folders from the MS-DOS client, the following error message may
appear:

   Notice 51:
   No folders to select

CAUSE
=====

This error can be caused by a corrupt or missing private folder index file. It
can also be caused when you try to access private folders created in Mail for
Windows from the MS-DOS client.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the index file is missing, restore it from a backup copy. The index file
(.IDX) should reside in the following sub-directory:

   maildata\folders\loc\xxxxxxxx

where XXXXXXXX is your associated hexadecimal filename. The index file will be
named using the same hexadecimal number (XXXXXXX.IDX). Run LISTUSER.EXE to
obtain your hexadecimal number.

If no valid backup exists, run FIXIDX.EXE to recreate the folder index file.

NOTE: The following procedure will remove the human-readable folder names. In
order to recreate the folder names later, DUMPFLD.EXE should be run against all
folders before hand, in order to obtain the original name:

   dumpfld xxxxxxxx.fld

Once you obtain all the information you need, you can run FIXIDX.EXE (from your
private folders sub-directory) using the following command:

   fixidx xxxxxxxx.idx xxxxxxxx

where XXXXXXXX.IDX is the index file to be created and XXXXXXXX is the your
hexadecimal filename.

Folder names can be re-assigned to their original, human-readable names from
within the client using Options, Folders, Modify.
