The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows and you change your friendly
name, you will see both your old and new friendly names in the Address Book.

CAUSE
=====

Changing your friendly name on the postoffice does not change your friendly name
in Mail Remote for Windows unless you obtain a new Data disk.

When you change your friendly name, your friendly name listed in the RNETWORK.GLB
file no longer matches your friendly name listed in the CONNECT.GLB file.

Mail Remote for Windows gets a user's friendly name from the CONNECT.GLB file and
creates the local postoffice list. If the Remote user is in the list, nothing
happens. Because the name has changed, the new name isn't found, so Mail Remote
for Windows add the new name.

RESOLUTION
==========

Contact your system administrator and ask for a new Data disk when you change
your friendly name.
