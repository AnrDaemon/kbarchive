The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows screen display does
not automatically adjust to a different monitor resolution. This is by design.

For example, User1 on WorkstationA (VGA monitor) has mail set up to be one inch
from the screen border. If User1 switches to WorkstationB (SVGA monitor), the
Mail display will not be one inch from the screen border. Mail for Windows does
not automatically adjust its resolution to the new display.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The screen coordinates (the window location) are not device independent. This is
true of all Windows applications. When any application is created on MonitorA
(VGA), the application does not automatically adjust to MonitorB (a different
monitor type).

To test this, create a document in WRITE.EXE. Manually position the Write
document to be one inch from each of the screen borders. Save the document and
re-open the document on another computer with a different kind of monitor. The
WRITE document will not be one inch from each of the borders.

All windows applications save their documents based upon the last screen
coordinates (the window location). No window applications will automatically
adjust to a different monitor resolution.
