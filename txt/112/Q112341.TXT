TITLE   :FIX: LOC Fails on Double COMPLEX Structure Element
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortrankbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the LOC intrinsic function to return the address of a COMPLEX*16 structure
variable results in an address of 0 (zero).

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the LOC function on a different type of field in the structure and then
calculate the address of the DOUBLE PRECISION COMPLEX field. If necessary,
create a UNION block to map a different variable type to the double COMPLEX
element.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation for Windows
NT, version 1.0 and for MS-DOS, versions 1.0 and 1.0a. This problem was
corrected in FORTRAN PowerStation 32, version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample illustrates the problem:

Sample Code
-----------

   c Compile options needed: none
   c
         structure /nest/ 
           double complex tests
         end structure

         record /nest/ t
         t.tests=(0.,0.)
         i = loc(t.tests)
         print10, 'loc(t.tests)          ', i,i
   10    format(1x,a,i8,3x,z)
         end
