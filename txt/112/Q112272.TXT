SUMMARY
=======

The Operator and Monitor terminate-and-stay resident programs (TSRs) that are
used with the MS-DOS client are only capable of using the postoffice address
list (POL) or the user's personal address list (PAL). The global address list
(GAL), Postoffice Network List, and Microsoft Mail gateway address lists are not
available for use in these two TSRs.

You can use the CTRL+PAGE UP and CTRL+PAGE DOWN keystrokes to toggle between the
two usable address lists.
