-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1x, 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you modify external postoffices from the Mail Administrator program
(ADMIN.EXE), the following error message appears:

   Notice 10
   No external postoffices have been defined yet

CAUSE
=====

This error can be caused by incorrect network rights or a missing .XTN file for
the associated network.

For each network that is defined in the NETWORK.GLB file, there is an associated
.XTN file. This file contains a series of records, each one defining a different
postoffice on the network. The purpose of this file is to provide routing,
naming, and sign-on information for external services and postoffices. When you
add a new postoffice to a network, the associated .XTN file needs to be opened
and amended.

RESOLUTION
==========

Restore the .XTN file from a valid backup copy or create a new, zero-byte .XTN
file. By examining the NETWORK.GLB file, you can obtain the relevant .XTN file
for each defined network. The NETWORK.GLB file contains the names of all defined
external networks. Immediately following the external network name is a
hexadecimal number; this number is the filename of the associated .XTN file
(found in the XTN subdirectory).
