-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Mail clients may behave erratically for no apparent reason after you use the
MOVEUSER utility. The workstation may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

When the MOVEUSER utility calculates the total disk space needed to move a user
or set of users, it fails to detect the logon status of the user or users. Even
if the user is logged on using Mail at the time, an administrator who has just
moved the account of that user can delete it and not receive a warning about the
current logon status.

WORKAROUND
==========

Before you use the MOVEUSER utility , make sure all users you want to move are
not logged into Mail or using their postoffice. There are various ways to do
this, depending on the type of Mail client being used. Under extreme conditions,
failing to ensure the all users are logged off before you delete mailbox
accounts can result in the loss of data.
