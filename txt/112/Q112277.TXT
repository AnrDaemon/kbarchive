TITLE   :PC Win: StripGatewayHeaders Requires FIPS TEXTBORDER
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The StripGatewayHeaders=1 option for MSMAIL.INI in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2
of Microsoft Mail for Windows only works if the version of the Gateway creates
the FIPS TEXTBORDER field on messages inbound to MS Mail.

The FIPS TEXTBORDER is a binary field that tells the Mail for Windows how many
lines of the message text are actually header. If the gateway does not support
this field then using this option would give undesired results--a corrupted
message.

Please note that all 2.1 and earlier versions of gateways do not create
TEXTBORDER.

MORE INFORMATION
================

StripGatewayHeaders=<0/1/2>
---------------------------

If this entry is 1, then message header text (coming above the dashed line) will
be stripped from Mail messages that arrive via a gateway. Set the entry to 0 if
you want to see the extended information supplied by the gateways, which
typically includes things like message identifiers specific to the foreign mail
system. Message header text supplied by native Mail clients is always stripped.

The default value is 1 (you do not see gateway information).

Setting the option to 2 will strip everything except X.400 headers.


Additional query words: 3.00 3.00b 3.20
