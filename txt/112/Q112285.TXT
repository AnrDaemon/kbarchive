The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When IMPORT.EXE is invoked with the -R option, the end result is identical to
when the import text file contains a Replace transaction line (for example, "R
Gateway:"). The -R option is supported primarily for compatibility with version
2.1x Mail for PC Networks postoffices.

The R transaction gives you a little more flexibility because you can replace
multiple gateway address lists or multiple PC Mail postoffices from within the
same input file.

NOTE: The only difference between the Replace transaction and the -R parameter is
that -R will modify the postoffice address list (POL) if the -A parameter is
also used. The Replace transaction does not.
