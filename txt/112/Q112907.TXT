-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On startup (if you have chosen periodic or scheduled events), Microsoft Mail
Remote for Windows tries to get a timer. If a timer is not available (for
example, the Windows system cannot be acquired), Mail Remote for Windows
disables time-based features and issues the following error message:

   Can not schedule connection. Close down other time-based applications and
   restart mail

However, if you have not requested a periodic or scheduled connection, this error
does not appear.

CAUSE
=====

In the Session Setup dialog box, if a timer isn't available, periodic and
scheduled options are unavailable (grayed) from the connection group. The error
message only appears if you have auto connect set to ON in your
<Windows_Directory>\MSMAIL.INI file.

Additional query words: 1.00 gray grey greyed
