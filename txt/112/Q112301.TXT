TITLE   :PC Dirsync: Err Msg: File Error Sorting Queue Usrtrans.glb
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The update transactions that you expect may not appear in the global address
list and the following error messages may appear in the Dirsync.log file:

   FATAL [150] Could not append transactions to the updates file
   ERROR [45] File error sorting queue usrtrans.glb

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the Usrtrans.glb file is corrupted. The corruption may
be due to a network problem. If this is the case, network rights and network
hardware may need to be examined. Slow or unreliable network interface cards in
the workstation or file server may need to be examined as well.

Another cause of the error [45] is a Sortlock.glb file in the postoffice's GLB
subdirectory. Sortlock.glb is a temporary file that ensures that Import.exe is
not run on the same PO at the same time.

An additional cause for an error [45] is a corrupt Reqconf.glb file. Depending on
the nature of the corruption, LISTDS can be used to fix the corrupt file. The
problems with the Reqconf.glb file result in ONLY an error [45] in the
Dirsync.log with no accompanying error messagess:

   Status Microsoft (R) Mail Import v3.2
   Error [45] File error sorting queue: USRTRANS
   Status Import is finished.

NOTE: The specific issues dealt with had a corrupt pointer to the Usrtrans file
in the Reqconf.glb file. This was corrected by setting all of the pointers (4
total) to -1. An alternate way to correct a corrupt Reqconf.glb file is to copy
a Reqconf.glb file from another postoffice that is not experiencing this
problem. Then do a local reset on the postoffice that is experiencing the error
[45].

   Q96060 PC DirSync: Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync)

RESOLUTION
==========

Reset the Usrtrans.glb file to zero bytes, and ensure that the requestor
postoffice asks for a full import from the directory synchronization (dirsync)
server by following these steps:

1. From MS-DOS, change to the GLB subdirectory in the Mail database.

2. Use the MS-DOS TYPE command to reset the size of the Usrtrans.glb file to
   zero bytes:

   type "NUL > USRTRANS.GLB" (without the quotation marks)

3. Delete the temporary files if they are present in the GLB directory:
   Igwtrans.glb, Inmetran.glb, Iusrtran.glb, Srvupds.glb, Requpds.glb, and any
   Sortxxx files, where XXXX is a number.

   Verify that Srvtrans.glb, Gwtrans.glb, and Nmetrans.glb are zero bytes.

4. Verify that:

   a. There is sufficient disk space available; go to the dirsync server, add
      the file sizes for all USR files in the USR subdirectory in the Mail
      database, and then triple that amount.

   b. The workstation running Dispatch.exe has set FILES=60 (or greater) in the
      Config.sys file.

   c. There are sufficient network access rights available for the dispatch
      machine.

   d. The network hardware is reliable.

5. Allow dirsync to run through another cycle.

If the error reoccurs after these steps, perform steps 1 and 2 again, and then
proceed with the following steps:

6. Run Import.exe on the dirsync server. Use the following command to create the
   Resync.glb file.

   option '-S'

7. Copy the Resync.glb file from the dirsync server's GLB directory to the
   requestor's GLB directory.

8. Delete the Resync.glb file from the dirsync server.

9. Allow dirsync to run through another cycle.
