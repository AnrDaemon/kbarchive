SUMMARY
=======

If the "Fast Printing Direct to Port" option is enabled from the Microsoft
Windows Control Panel, print-job data will be sent directly to the printer port,
using COMM.drv. Otherwise, MS-DOS _lwrite() calls will be used to write data to
the port. The Fast Printing Direct to Port setting corresponds to the DosPrint
entry in the [Windows] section of WIN.ini.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a print job is started by a printer driver, the printer driver will call
into GDI, using the OpenJob() function. Within OpenJob(), GDI uses the following
sequence of steps to determine whether to print directly to the port, or to use
MS-DOS _lwrite:

1. Attempts to call the network driver's WNetOpenJob() function, if that
   function exists. If WNetOpenJob succeeds, indicating that the port is a
   redirected network port, GDI will use _lwrite() to write to the port,
   regardless of the "Fast Printing Direct to Port" setting. Otherwise

2. Checks to see if "Fast Printing Direct to Port" is selected. If it is not
   selected, GDI will use _lwrite() to write to the port. Otherwise:

3. Calls OpenComm() for the selected port. If OpenComm() succeeds, the
   communications API, which call into COMM.drv, will be used to write to the
   port [WriteComm()]. Otherwise:

4. Uses _lwrite().
