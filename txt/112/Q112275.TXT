TITLE   :Mac Wkst: Address Error at _CopyRgn
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During startup, if both version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks and
Pointing Device CDEV version 1.2 are installed under System 6.x, then the
following error will be displayed:

   Address Error at _CopyRgn

CAUSE
=====

The INIT drawing code in this INIT/CDEV is custom code. It is standard procedure
to use Apple's sanctioned "ShowINIT" source code for INIT/CDEV to display their
icons while booting. If prevented from displaying this code, the problem will be
solved. Another alternative is to load Pointing Device last by renaming it to
"zPointing Device."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.1 of Mail for
AppleTalk Networks. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
