-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to access a file with a .DRW extension that is not a Lotus
Freelance for MS-DOS file (version 3.0 or 4.0) by clicking Open on the File menu
or by clicking Slides From File on the Insert menu, one of the following error
messages appear.

In PowerPoint 7.0, you will receive the following message:

   Sorry, this type of file cannot be opened by PowerPoint.

In PowerPoint 4.0, you will receive the following message:

   PP4 caused a General Protection Fault in module FL40DOS.PDI at 0001:AD35.

CAUSE
=====

Several graphics applications (Micrografx Designer, for example) use the same
file extension (.DRW) for their data files as Lotus Freelance for MS- DOS. The
Freelance translator is expecting the .DRW files to be from Lotus Freelance for
MS-DOS. The error occurs when the Freelance translator encounters the unfamiliar
file format from a non-Lotus graphics application.

RESOLUTION
==========

To import .DRW graphics files, click Insert Picture on the Edit menu rather than
clicking Open on the File menu or clicking Slides From File on the Insert menu.
