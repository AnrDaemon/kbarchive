The information in this article applies to:

 - MSPRESS Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 386 of the Windows NT Resource Guide (Volume 1 of the Microsoft
Windows NT Resource Kit) references the BootExecute parameter. The
following example is given for converting the file system on a hard disk
drive:

   BootExecute = autocheck autoconv \Dos\Devices\x: /FS:NTFS

This information is incorrect. The statement should read:

   BootExecute = autocheck autoconv \DosDevices\x: /FS:NTFS

This reference is also incorrect in the Registry Help file.

Additional query words: prodnt reskit
