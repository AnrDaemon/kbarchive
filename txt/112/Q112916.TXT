SUMMARY
=======

The postoffice storage status displays file space in bytes. These byte totals
are not for the bytes occupied by the file; they are for the blocks allocated
for the file.

The totals listed in the Mail Administrator program (when you select Local-Admin,
Storage, Status) are generated in the following manner:

 - The byte total for File Space Used for Mailbags is the sum of the blocks used
   by the .MBG and .KEY files.

 - The total for Number of Mail Messages is the number of files with .MAI and
   .ATT extensions.

 - The byte total for File Space Used for Mail Messages is the sum of the blocks
   used by the .MAI and .ATT files.

Additional query words: 1.00 1.10 admin admin.exe
