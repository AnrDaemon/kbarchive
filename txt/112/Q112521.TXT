OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

On a Macintosh computer when you use the Chooser to connect to shared CD- ROM
drive on a Windows NT Advanced Server with Services for Macintosh (SFM), the
Macintosh operating system creates a file handle for the CD-ROM. If you change
the compact disc and try to access it from the Macintosh the following error
message appears:

   ERROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

WORKAROUND
==========

Put the original compact disc back into the drive. You can now access the remote
CD-ROM drive. To access a different compact disc, disconnect your network
connection to the remote drive and reconnect to it after you have put the new
disc in the drive.
