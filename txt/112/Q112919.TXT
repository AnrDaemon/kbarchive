If a particular import data file is consistently causing errors or problems
when importing, the data file may be corrupted. Two common error messages
caused by corrupted data files are:

   There was a problem importing the file.
   Some items may not have been added.

   -or-

   There was a problem importing the file (near line XXX).
   Some items may not have been added.

You also may also experience a general protection (GP) fault when importing
a file.

In some cases, it may be possible to salvage all or at least most of the
data file information depending on the level of file damage.

There are generally three ways to avoid this error and import your data
successfully:

1. Re-create the import file from scratch by using the original application and
   importing the file again.

2. Re-create the import file from a different format:

   a. From the original application, save the data file in a different format
      (if the application allows for this). For example, WordPerfect Office
      version 3.0 allows the file to be saved in the version 2.0 format.

   b. Save the file back into the original format. For example, save the
      Wordperfect Office version 2.0 file back as version 3.0. This usually
      strips out any invalid information such as corrupted ASCII values.

   c. Import the file again.

3. Remove some appointments from the import file:

   a. Back up the import data file.

   b. From the original application, delete some appointments or other
      information from the file.

   c. Import the file again.

   d. Repeat this process until the file is successfully imported.
