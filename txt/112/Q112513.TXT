TITLE   :BUG: SQL Server ODBC Driver Removes Entry From WIN.INI
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbBug kbISS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 1.0

BUG# ODBCSS: 2834 (1.01.22807)

SYMPTOMS
========

If an existing data source is reconfigured in such a way that only its name is
changed using either ODBC Administrator or ODBC icon from Control Panel for the
SQL Server driver, the corresponding server entry in the WIN.INI entry (for
non-default network or Network Library) is removed.

For example, assume a data source called MYSOURCE is configured and maps to a SQL
Server machine called SQLNT1. Also it is using dbmsspx3 net-library. So in the
ODBC.INI file, the server entry for [MYSOURCE] would be SQLNT1 and the
corresponding entry in WIN.INI for this would be under SQL Server section as
follows:

      [SQL Server]
      SQLNT1=dbmsspx3,SQLNT1

Now if the data source name is changed from MYSOURCE to NEWSRC using ODBC
Administrator or ODBC icon in the control panel, the above entry for SQLNT1 will
be removed. This happens even though the server entry in ODBC.INI for the
[NEWSRC] still points to SQLNT1.

NOTE: In case of default network and net-library, no entry in needed in the
WIN.INI.

WORKAROUND
==========

Remove the data source and the add it back again. That will add the entry back
in WIN.INI.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SQL Server Driver version
1.01.2807. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
