The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1x, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Versions 2.1x and 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks requires five tildes (~)
to be used per line in the ADMIN.TPL file. This is necessary even if default
values are used for any of the four entries.

The proper format for the ADMIN.TPL file is:

   Field_Prompt:~Entry1~Entry2~Entry3~Entry4~

If any of the tildes are missing, you will receive the following error when you
try to create a new user in the Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE):

   Notice 31
   Error loading template.
   Press ENTER to continue

Furthermore, no ADMIN.TPL template information will be visible when you modify an
existing account in the Mail Administrator program.

WORKAROUND
==========

Check the ADMIN.TPL file and ensure that it follows the proper format shown
above.


Additional query words: 2.10x 3.00 admin
