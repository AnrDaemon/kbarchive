-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Versions 3.0b and later of Microsoft Mail for Windows includes a built-in
utility to check and rebuild Mail message files (MMFs). To start the utility,
you hold down the SHIFT key when you start Mail. After a few seconds a dialog
box appears that asks you to confirm your desire to check the integrity of your
MMF file.

If you continue to hold down the SHIFT key while you request the utility to check
the MMF file (by selecting the Check File button), you are repeatedly asked if
you want to check your MMF file. After the tenth dialog box is cleared, you
receive the following error:

   Application Error
   Stack overflow

RESOLUTION
==========

After the dialog box appears that asks whether you want to rebuild the MMF file,
release the SHIFT key before you select the Check File button. The Check MMF
utility will launch normally.

Additional query words: 3.00b 3.20 rebuild
