TITLE   :VB3 PRB: Making .EXE Error: Wrong Version of Runtime DLL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:3.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a copy of an executable is running on your computer, and you try to create a
new executable with the same name, you'll receive this error:

   Wrong version of runtime DLL.

followed by another error:

   Unexpected error quitting.

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused by the fact that Windows doesn't load a new copy of a
module if it thinks the module is already in memory. Because one instance of
your .EXE file is running already, attempting to run the re-compiled version
really just increments the usage count of the .EXE that is already running.

The Visual Basic error occurs because VBRUN300.DLL tries to open the .EXE file
and read resources out of it. But the .EXE file you're reading from is different
from the .EXE file that is actually running (because you did a 'Make EXE' over
the old one), so VBRUN300 has problems. It signals with the "Wrong version of
run-time DLL" error. It reports this error because it is under the assumption
that because it could not read the .EXE file, it doesn't have the correct
version of VBRUN needed to execute that .EXE file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the problem, either rename the .EXE when you create a new
executable, or exit from the executable that is currently running.
