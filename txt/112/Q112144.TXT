The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Synoptics EZ VIEW network management software allows a Windows for Workgroups
workstation running Chameleon TCP/IP network protocol software to remotely view
the status of Synoptic concentrators and hubs. Following is the procedure to set
up Windows for Workgroups to work with Chameleon TCP/IP and EZ VIEW. This
configuration works for Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 and future
upgrades.

NOTE: This configuration is NOT supported by Microsoft or Synoptics.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following procedures assume that Windows for Workgroups is located in the
C:\WINDOWS directory.

1. Install WFW 3.11 with the custom option:

   a. Select the proper NIC and NDIS driver.

   b. Do not select TCP/IP as a protocol.

2. In CONFIG.SYS, remove all drivers related to NETMANAGE, such as PROTMAN.DOS
   and NETMANAG.DOS. The following device driver is needed:

   DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\IFSHLP.SYS

3. In AUTOEXEC.BAT, make sure that NETBIND is not executed. All binding should
   be performed by the NET START command.

4. In PROTOCOL.INI, add the following NETMANAGE section and bind it to the NDIS
   driver section as shown below:

         [NETMANAGE]
         DRIVERNAME = NETMNGS
         BINDINGS =  <NDIS driver section name>

5. In SYSTEM.INI, add NETMANAG.DOS to the transport settings in the [NETWORK
   DRIVERS] section as shown below:

         [NETWORK DRIVERS]
         .
         .
         transport = ndishlp.sys,c:\netmanag\netmanag.dos,*netbeui
         .
         .

6. Also in SYSTEM.INI, change the LoadRMDrivers line to YES as shown below:

         Example:
         LoadRMDrivers = Yes

NOTE: This configuration installs Chameleon's TCP/IP as a single network protocol
for Windows for Workgroups.
