======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1x, 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under versions 2.1x, 3.0, 3.0a and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, when
you log into the MS-DOS client, the following error message appears:

   Notice 34
   Could Not Access Log Information File

CAUSE
=====

This error may have been caused by corruption in any of the following files:

   ACCESS.GLB
   ACCESS2.GLB
   ACCESS3.GLB

ACCESS.GLB, ACCESS2.GLB, and ACCESS3.GLB can be checked for corruption by
dividing them by the following figures:

   ACCESS.GLB divide by 586
   ACCESS2.GLB divide by 69
   ACCESS3.GLB divide by 512

If these files do not divide evenly, there is a good chance they are corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

If a backup exists restore the following files:

   ACCESS.GLB
   ACCESS2.GLB
   ACCESS3.GLB
   ADMIN.NME
   ADMINSHD.NME
   ADMIN.GRP
   ADMINSHD.GRP

These files should all be restored from the most recent, valid backup. Should
users have been added to the mail system since the time of this backup, these
users will have to be redefined after the restoration. MS-DOS client users
should make an archive of their mail folders and Inbox, prior to the
restoration, which can be restored upon recreation of the mailbox. Windows
client users should make a backup of their Mail message file which can be
re-imported using the Import Folders function upon recreation of their mailbox.
