SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.22 of Novell NETX handles MS-DOS file commit application programming
interface (API) calls differently than previous versions of NETX. Previous
versions ignored the MS-DOS API interrupt 21h, function 68h call to flush disk
buffers from RAM to disk. NETX treated the call as if it were already performed.
Version 3.22 of NETX tells the workstation to stop processing until an
acknowledgment of the cache flush is received. This delay can affect the
performance of workstations.

To have NetWare ignore this API call, use the NetWare file server command, SET
NCP FILE COMMIT = OFF. This command controls the behavior of file commit
requests by a workstation. If the value is ON, a file commit request causes all
pending writes to be written immediately. Setting the value to OFF causes the
cache manager to flush pending writes to the disk later. (The default value for
NetWare servers is ON.) Changing the parameter to OFF should show performance
similar to previous versions of NETX. However, there is a slight risk of data
corruption if the server fails before the disk writes are completed.

NETX is manufactured by Novell, Inc., a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make
no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
