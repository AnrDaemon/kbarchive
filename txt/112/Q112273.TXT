OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In versions 3.0 and 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, the version of
a Server may be displayed incorrectly when running a Global- Server Report.

The incorrect display denotes a 4-digit number rather than a real version number
such as 3.1 or 3.1a.

CAUSE
=====

There are two reasons this display may occur:

1. The version of the Mail Network Administrator program is earlier than the
   version of the Microsoft Mail Server being checked.

2. You are using both Microsoft Mail Server and Microsoft Mail Administrator
   version 3.1.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the display problem, upgrade to the most current version of the
Microsoft Mail Administrator program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When running Microsoft Mail 3.1a on both the server and the Admin program, the
incorrect display cannot be prevented. Microsoft Mail 3.1c corrects this
problem.


Additional query words: 3.10
