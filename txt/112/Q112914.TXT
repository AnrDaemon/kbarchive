The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail and Schedule+ Extensions for Microsoft Windows for Workgroups, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The "Upgrade Guide" for version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail and Schedule+ Extensions
for Microsoft Windows for Workgroups, does not document the prompt that asks for
the Network name and Postoffice name. This was added to the program after the
guide went to print. The prompt is described in the README.TXT file that come
with the product.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is a exerpt from the README.TXT file:

B.1. Running EXTEND.EXE
-----------------------

This program will now ask you for a postoffice and network name. For more
information, see the Microsoft Mail Administrator's Guide.

B.8. Changing Postoffice and Network Names
------------------------------------------

When you create a Workgroup Postoffice using Windows for Workgroups, it uses the
values you assign to your Computer Name and Workgroup for your Postoffice name
and Network name. These values are specified in the Network Control Panel. It is
not recommended that you change these names as part of the upgrade procedure, as
this will invalidate all mail addresses using the old names. However, you can
make this change using the Password command in ADMIN.EXE.

Some characters that are valid in the Computer Name and Workgroup boxes are not
valid for the Postoffice and Network name fields. If you use an invalid
character, you will be prompted to enter a new name for the corresponding field.
Note that in this case, your mail addresses will be invalidated. This set of
characters is:

   ~ ` ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ - + = { [ } ] | \ : ; " ' < , > . ? /

Additional query words: 3.00
