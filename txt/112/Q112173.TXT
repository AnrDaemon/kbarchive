TITLE   :PC WSPlus: Drag & Drop Schedule+ Reassigns Appointment Times
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an appointment that spans a preset time slot is moved into a new time slot
with the mouse, it will reset the time the appointment begins and its duration
to reflect the time represented by the icon.

For example, if you create a 20 minute appointment from 10:50 to 11:10, the
appointment will display as extending from 10:30 to 11:30. If you then select
the appointment using the mouse, relocate the beginning of the appointment to
12:00, and view the time frame, by choosing Edit Appointment from the Edit menu,
the appointment will now begin at 12:00 and the time assigned to the appointment
will now be 1 hour from 12:00 to 1:00.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design.

RESOLUTION
==========

The start time, date, and appointment duration will coincide with the location
and size of the icon. To preserve the appointment[ASCII 146]s original duration,
choose Move Appointment from the Edit menu. The Move Appointment command will
allow you to change the appointment's date as well as the time.
