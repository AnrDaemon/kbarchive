SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows can take several minutes to time out (stop
trying to send information) if your modem is turned off. If you have time-out
problems initializing your modem, make sure it is connected properly and turned
on.

For every "SEND" or "SENDLN" keyword in a script, Microsoft Mail Remote for
Windows writes to the serial communications layer and checks if the data has
been written. It also checks to see if the time is up. If the modem is off or
not attached, nothing gets sent. Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows waits until
the appropriate time-out for every "SEND" or "SENDLN." Depending upon how many
"SEND" or "SENDLN" commands are in your script, this can take from several
minutes to much longer.
