The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To move a postoffice from one server to another, follow these steps:
 

1. At any workstation, log onto the network as an administrator.

2. Connect to the server and directory where the postoffice is located. NOTE:
   Connect to the server using a drive letter.

3. As in step 2, connect to the destination server and directory.

4. From the current postoffice location, type the following command so you have
   a hard copy of all the postoffice file attributes:

   "attrib *.* /s > <filename>.txt" (without the quotation marks)

5. If Schedule+ is installed, change to the CAL subdirectory and type the
   following commands:

   "attrib -h schedule.key
   cd.." (without the quotation marks)

6. From the current postoffice location, type

   "xcopy *.* <drive>: /s /e" (without the quotation marks)

   where <drive> is the destination drive you specified in step 3.

7. Change drives to the new postoffice location. If Schedule+ is installed,
   change to the CAL directory and type the following commands:

   "attrib +h schedule.key
   cd.." (without the quotation marks)

8. Use the <FILENAME>.TXT file you created in step 4 to manually change
   all previously read-only files back to read-only by typing

   "attrib +r <filename2>" (without the quotation marks)

   where <filename2> is the file you want to make read-only.

   NOTE: Do not change these file attributes all at once (by using a wildcard).
   Mail will not function properly if you do.
