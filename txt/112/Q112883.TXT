The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Connection Gateway, version 1.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Successfully running MACGATE.EXE requires separate drives or drive mapping to
the postoffice database (..\MAILDATA) and the executable directory (..\MAILEXE)
containing the four MS-DOS executables needed by the Microsoft Mail Connection
version 1.0b (MACGATE.EXE, MACGET.EXE, MACPUT.EXE, and IMPORT.EXE).

When you run MACGATE.EXE, the executable directory must be the current
directory.

If you attempt to run MACGATE.EXE from a directory other than the executable
directory or if you do not have a separate drive mapping for the data and
executables you get an error similar to this:

   Error running FFAPI program: No such file or directory
   Bad parameter value. (110)
   : 74
   exiting on (date time) with status 74 (118)

Or if the executable directory is pathed:

   IMPORT.EXE not found. Check executable path or copy from distribution
   diskette.
   exiting on (date time) with status 81 (118)

If you have only one drive mapping and try to run MACGATE.EXE with all other
parameters and settings correct, your current directory would change to
..\MAILDATA and you would get one of the above errors. For example,

   M:\MAILEXE> macgate

would result in one the above errors followed by:

   M:\MAILDATA>
