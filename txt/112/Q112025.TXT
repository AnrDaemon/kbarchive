PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win31

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The WW1000.EXE file contains VSHARE.386 version 3.11.0.402. This version of
VSHARE.386 is compatible with Microsoft Windows version 3.1 and Windows for
Workgroups versions 3.1 and 3.11.

   NOTE: Microsoft Office versions 4.2 and 4.3 install version 3.11.0.401 of
   VSHARE.386.

This version of VSHARE.386 differs from the version included with Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 (version 3.11.0.300) in the following ways:

 - This version of VSHARE.386 supports Windows version 3.1.

 - This version of VSHARE.386 corrects a problem than can cause Windows for
   Workgroups 3.11 to stop responding (hang) when you start your computer.

USING VSHARE.386
----------------

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are using applications that support OLE 2.0, you must run either
SHARE.EXE or VSHARE.386. VSHARE.386 eliminates the need to run SHARE.EXE when
you run Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups in 386 enhanced mode. If you run
Windows 3.1 in standard mode, you must run SHARE.EXE. If you run applications
that are not compatible with SHARE.EXE and you are running Windows 3.1 in 386
enhanced mode, the applications may work with VSHARE.386 instead of SHARE.EXE.

INSTALLING THE UPDATED VSHARE.386 FILE
--------------------------------------

To install VSHARE.386 version 3.11.0.402, follow these steps:

1. Download the WW1000.EXE file from the Microsoft Software Library.

3. Quit Windows.

4. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following command and then press
   ENTER

   copy <source>:\vshare.386 <location>

   where <source> is the directory containing the file you downloaded from
   online services, and <location> is the path to your Windows\SYSTEM
   subdirectory.

   For example, if you downloaded the WW1000.EXE file from online services to
   C:\DOWNLOAD and C:WINDOWS\SYSTEM is the path to your Windows\SYSTEM
   subdirectory, type:

   copy c:\download\vshare.386 c:\windows\system

5. Use any text editor (such as MS-DOS Editor) to edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
   Remove the SHARE.EXE command from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and then save and
