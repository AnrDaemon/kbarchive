-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and you try to reinstall
compressed TrueType fonts from floppy disk through Control Panel, your system
may stop responding (hang), and you may receive the error message below when
font retrieval is between 3 percent and 20 percent complete:

   An error has occurred in your application. If you choose Ignore, you should
   save your work in a new file. If you choose Close, your application will
   terminate.

Choosing the Ignore button has no effect; you must choose Close. If you then
repeat the steps to reinstall the fonts, the system quits Windows unexpectedly,
leaving you at an MS-DOS command prompt.

NOTE: These symptoms do not occur if the fonts are in uncompressed form.

RESOLUTION
==========

Fonts must be manually expanded to a directory on either a floppy disk or the
hard disk drive before you can reinstall them through Control Panel. For
example, to reinstall the Arial TrueType font from a floppy disk in drive A to
the hard disk drive (drive C), you would first use the following command to
expand the file:

   expand a:\arial.tt_ c:\windows\system\arial.ttf

Then reinstall the font through Control Panel.

To expand all compressed TrueType fonts to a directory (for example, C:\FONTS)
from a floppy disk in drive A, use the Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
EXPAND.EXE utility as follows:

   c:\windows\expand -r a:\*.tt_ c:\fonts
