SUMMARY
=======

If you remove the Domain Users global group from the Users local group on a
Windows NT server, users of the domain may only be validated in the Guests local
group. If you disable the Guests group, users might not be validated at all.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To make local domain administration easier, a local group consists of users and
global groups from one or more domains. You can use local groups to manage
resource use in the local domain.

If the Domain Users global group is not listed in the Users local group, users
might not get validated as legitimate domain users; they may only receive guest
privileges. Although the best solution is to put Domain Users in Users, you can
also enter specific domain users in the Users group.
