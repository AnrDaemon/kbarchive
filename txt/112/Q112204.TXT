-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

On page 283 of the version 3.0 Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
"Administrator[ASCII 146]s Guide" and on page 322 of the version 3.2
"Administrator's Guide," it states that after the Import utility completes a
task it will display MS-DOS errorlevel codes. This is misleading; the codes are
not visible to the user.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The documentation does not explicitly state that the Import utility does not
generate external errorlevel codes, but rather internal errorlevel codes. The
Import utility will generate various MS-DOS internal errorlevel codes when it
participates in directory synchronization (Dir-Sync).

These codes are typically received and processed by DISPATCH.EXE, which is
responsible for calling and governing the automatic Dir-Sync process.

The IMPORT utility itself incorporates its own error codes to be received and
processed by DISPATCH.EXE during the automated Dir-Sync process. Mail
administrators attempting to employ any fault tolerance schemes dependent on
these implied external errorlevel codes will unlikely be able to do so.
