======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Scenes (all collections), version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you are running Microsoft Scenes version 1.0 for Windows with After Dark, the
After Dark program lists only the Sierra, Outer Space, and Impressionist
collections in its list of screen saver modules.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Quick Reference Card included with Microsoft Scenes states that any Scenes
collection can be added to the After Dark control panel.

You can run the default Scenes picture sets (Sierra, Outer Space, and
Impressionist) from the After Dark control panel because they are set up as
After Dark modules during the installation of Scenes. Custom picture sets that
are created individually or by Genigraphics, cannot be set up as After Dark
modules and are not recognized by After Dark.
