TITLE   :PRB: "SQL Column '<Memvar>' Not Found" and Empty RQBE Window
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.5b; MS-DOS:2.0,2.5,2.5a,2.5b; WINDOWS:2.5,2.5a,2.5b,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.5b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are opening or modifying a previously saved query, the error message
"SQL Column '<variable name>' Not Found" appears. After the error message
is displayed, the query will open, but everything except the table(s) used will
be lost (including selected fields and WHERE conditions).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by referring to a variable in a query and then opening
or modifying the query when the variable is not in memory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure the variable is defined in memory before opening or modifying the
query. Make sure not to save the changes to the query after it opens up empty.
The error message will indicate the variable that needs to be in memory.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Type "x="CA"" (without the quotation marks) in the FoxPro command window.

2. USE the SALESMAN database found in the TUTORIAL subdirectory.

3. Create a new query using the RQBE window.

4. Set up the Selection Criteria as follows:

   Field Name: Salesman.state
   Operator: LIKE (the default)
   Example: x

5. Run the query to make sure it works. It should select four records if the
   SALESMAN database has not been modified since installation.

6. Save and close the query.

7. In the command window, type "RELEASE x" (without the quotation marks).

8. Open or modify the query. The error message "SQL column 'x' not found" will
   be displayed.

   Clicking the error message will clear the message and the query will open with
   only the table(s) used remaining. The information under Selection Criteria,
   Selected Fields, Order By, Group By, and Having will be cleared.

9. Don't save the empty query. If you do, the missing information will be
   permanently lost.

If the variable or variables used in the query are restored, the query will open
correctly.
