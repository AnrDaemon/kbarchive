SUMMARY
=======

The Phar Lap Lite DOS-Extender included with Visual C++ 32-bit Edition has a
sample program, GRAPHICS, that demonstrates the use of the 16-bit MS-DOS
graphics routines under Win32s.

However, the sample program does not mention that the 16-bit MS-DOS graphics
library is not included with Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, version 1.0. The user
must also have a version of Visual C++ for Windows (or C/C++ 7.0) to make 16-bit
graphics function calls under Win32s, because GRAPHICS.LIB is included in these
products.

Visual C++ 2.x is shipped with a version of Visual C++ for Windows which contains
GRAPHICS.LIB.
