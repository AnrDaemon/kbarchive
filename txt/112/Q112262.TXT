======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When reading a custom message from a shared folder using Simple Mail Application
Programming Interface (MAPI), it is possible that the message will be displayed
in the Compose form rather than the Read form. This can occur with any custom
message class, including those created using version 1.0 of Microsoft Electronic
Forms Designer.

CAUSE
=====

When Simple MAPI reads a message from a shared folder, it creates a temporary
copy of the message locally. This temporary message does not have its MAPI_SENT
bit set properly. When the custom message is read, it appears to MAPI as though
it has not been sent and displays it in the Compose form.

RESOLUTION
==========

This issue was addressed in the version of MAPI.DLL which is included with
version 1.0 of Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer.
