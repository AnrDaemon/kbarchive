TITLE   :SNMPTRAP Quits When Sending Information
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SNMPTRAP.EXE generates and exception and quits when it tries to send information
to client applications that are registered to receive but have since exited.

CAUSE
=====

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) uses the executable file SNMPTRAP.EXE
to detect traps and alert client applications of them.

SNMPTRAP.EXE creates named pipes through which it sends trap information to
client applications that want to receive it. If a requesting application ends,
however, and the pipe is broken, SNMPTRAP quits when it tries and fails to send
information over that pipe.

RESOLUTION
==========

A correction was made to MGMTAPI.DLL to handle this condition and eliminates the
symptom from SNMPTRAP.EXE.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem was corrected in the latest U.S.
Service Pack for Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1. For
