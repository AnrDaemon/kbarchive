TITLE   :Multimedia: Secondary Window on Top When Schubert Is Restored
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Multimedia Schubert for Windows, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Multimedia Mozart for Windows, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Multimedia Stravinsky for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you minimize and restore Schubert, Mozart, or Stravinsky, you may find that
secondary windows (such as the Glossary or Help) are in front of the main
window, even though they were not in front when you minimized the application.

Secondary windows should maintain their order when you minimize and maximize the
application.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Schubert version 1.0, Mozart
version 1.0, and Stravinsky version 1.0. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
