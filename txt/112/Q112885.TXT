======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1x, 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.0a, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, when you
compress the folders from within the Administrators program (ADMIN.EXE), the
following error may occur:

   Notice 71
   Failure to Compress Folder

CAUSE
=====

The error can be caused by corruption of folders and semaphore locking of
folders.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the folder is corrupt, it can be repaired using the following utilities:

   dumpidx -n xxxxxxxx.idx

This will dump out the folders English names and their associated hexadecimal
names.

Once the hexadecimal name of the folder is known, you can run FIXFLD.EXE:

   Rename xxxxxxxx.fld xxxxxxxx.bad

where xxxxxxxx.fld is the damaged folder.

Run the following command from the directory containing the damaged folder:

   fixfld xxxxxxxx.bad xxxxxxxx.fld

This will run against the .BAD file and create the .FLD file. From ADMIN.EXE, run
Admin, Local Admin, Folders, Compress.

If the folder is semaphore locked, you can run the following to remove the
locks:

   foldcomp.exe -s

This should be run from the directory containing the locked folders.

================
