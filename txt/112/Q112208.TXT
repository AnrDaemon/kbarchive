KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Mail administrator can use the Mail Administrator (ADMIN.EXE) program to
restrict several user privileges. One of the privileges that can be restricted
is the delete privilege.

This privilege only applies to Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS
workstation. Microsoft Mail for Windows users can delete their mail messages
from their Inbox (since their messages are in their .MMF files), even if they
have not been granted the delete privilege. Furthermore, the messages will be
successfully deleted from the .MBG file as soon as they are placed in the user's
.MMF file. This is by design, to allow Mail for Windows users to work offline
and control their own mail message file (MMF) storage.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are restricted from deleting mail, the following error message appears
when you try to delete mail from the Mail for PC Networks MS-DOS client:

   Notice 10
   This ID cannot delete mail.
   Press ENTER to continue
