The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows will display duplicate header
information in the body of the welcome message if there are fewer than 78 dashes
separating the header information from the message text in the WELCOME.GLB
file.

In addition, if the subject was modified and there are fewer than 78 dashes, the
modified subject will appear in the duplicated header information, but the
original subject, "Welcome to the Mail System," will still be displayed in the
header.

If the number of dashes is greater than 78, the header will not be duplicated and
the modified subject will appear in the header; however, the additional dashes
will appear as the first characters in the welcome message.

This behavior only exists in Mail for Windows.


Additional query words: 3.00 3.20
