TITLE   :DIR and File Manager Show SFM Files with Wrong Size
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1 3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The wrong file size will be displayed when you view a Macintosh System
executable or font file on a Services For Macintosh (SFM) volume on a Windows NT
Server computer.

This problem will occur in all versions of Windows NT when you use DIR from the
command prompt or in File Manager. This will also occur when viewing a Macintosh
executable file with Windows NT 4.0 Explorer. A Macintosh client shows the
correct file size.

CAUSE
=====

Macintosh files have both a Data Fork and a Resource Fork. Windows NT gets the
file size info from the Data Fork. If no information is available in the Data
Fork, the file size displayed is zero. Both Macintosh executable files and font
files have 0 bytes listed in the Data Fork, so their size is displayed as 0
bytes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server versions 3.1,
3.5, 3.51 and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
