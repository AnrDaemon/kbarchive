-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are running a shared network installation of Windows for Workgroups from
a Windows NT or Windows for Workgroups server and you log off from the network
(either through Control Panel or by running LOGONOFF.EXE), you receive a series
of general protection (GP) faults. As a result, Windows for Workgroups stops
responding (hangs). This problem does not occur if you are running a shared
network installation of Windows for Workgroups from a Novell server.

CAUSE
=====

Windows for Workgroups encounters these problems because logging off closes the
redirector; as a result, you no longer have access to the network and the files
required to run Windows for Workgroups.

Additional query words: 3.11 logoff loggingoff setup /n wfwnet.drv
