TITLE   :DOCERR: Cannot Break on Condition in PowerStation Debugger
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft FORTRAN Visual Workbench help file incorrectly states that the
PowerStation debugger can be used to set breakpoints on certain conditions. This
is not correct. The FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0 and 1.0a debuggers do not
support this functionality.

This functionality is supported by FORTRAN PowerStation 32.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The information below is displayed when you choose FORTRAN Visual Workbench from
the Help menu, and then select Debugging Your Application:

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Set breakpoints for      Setting breakpoints to break at
   certain conditions       location, break when an
                            expression has changed, or
                            break at an exported Windows
                            function

The information in this section of the help file is not correct. The FORTRAN
PowerStation for MS-DOS does not support conditional breakpoints and cannot be
used to create applications for Windows.
