TITLE   :Schubert: GPF or Insufficient Memory Error with Orchid Video
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Multimedia Schubert for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you play the Trout Game and successfully match rocks, you may receive
either an insufficient memory error message or the following general protection
(GP) fault:

   Schubert has caused a General Protection Fault in VBRUN300.DLL at 0030:1163.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if you are using the Orchid Fahrenheit 1280 Advanced VGA
video driver and card.

This problem is most likely to occur when Schubert plays two animations one after
the other in the Trout Game (which is what happens when you successfully match
two rocks).

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Schubert version 1.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To eliminate this problem, use a different driver that is compatible with your
video card.

For information about changing your video mode, refer to pages 557-560 in the
"Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for Windows 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem generally occurs when you successfully match rocks in the Trout
Game. The MMTASK or the ORCHIDF driver causes the error and the GP Fault or the
insufficent memory message will appear. After choosing OK to accept these error
messages, Schubert usually displays an "MCI error" message box and then resumes
the game.

Occasionally when you receive these error messages, you may find that your CD-ROM
drive's "busy" LED begins to flash continuously and your system stops responding
(hangs). When this occurs, you must restart your computer.
