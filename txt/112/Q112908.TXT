-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1x, 3.0, 3.0a, 3.2, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: MS-DOS 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you access folders or Mail messages by selecting Folders from the MS-DOS
client, the following error may occur:

   Notice 50
   Folder Damaged Contact Administrator

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs if the folder containing the message has been corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To determine which folder file in the database is corrupt, the administrator
should run DUMPIDX.EXE from the user's private folder subdirectory
MAILDATA\FOLDERS\LOC\<HEXID> (use the LISTUSER utility to determine the
user's hexadecimal filename), by typing the following command:

   "dumpidx -n xxxxxxxx.idx" (without the quotation marks)

This command will dump the folder's English names and their associated
hexadecimal names.

Once you know the hexadecimal name of the corrupt folder, you can either restore
the folder from a backup copy or run the FIXFLD.EXE utility:

1. Rename XXXXXXXX.FLD (the damaged folder) to XXXXXXX.BAD.

2. Run the following command from the directory containing the damaged folder:

   "fixfld xxxxxxxx.bad xxxxxxxx.fld" (without the quotation marks)

   (This command will run the FIXFLD utility against the .BAD file and create the
   repaired .FLD file.)

3. From the Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE), select Local Admin, Folders,
   Compress.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DUMPIDX utility is available as part of the Database Maintenance Utilities.
