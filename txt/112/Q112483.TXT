======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Setup Wizard allows the Microsoft Graph run-time module to be included in
distributed applications. However, the run-time module does not include the full
functionality of the MS Graph application shipped with FoxPro.

WORKAROUNDS
-----------

 - Although the license agreement for MS Graph prohibits the distribution of the
   full version of MS Graph with applications, if the workstation on which the
   executable file is installed has the full version of MS Graph installed
   through FoxPro or another software package, that workstation will be able to
   access full graph functionality through the distributed executable file.

 - You can use a third-party graphics package instead of MS Graph to create
   graphs in distributed executables.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MS Graph run-time module can only be used to view existing graphs that have
been created and saved through the FoxPro Graph Wizard. The existing graphs
cannot be updated to include new data and formatting changes, except using
UPDATEGRPH. The run-time module also prohibits new graphs from being created.
