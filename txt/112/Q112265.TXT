Mail message file (MMF) compression and integrity checking are two
utilities that are available with Microsoft Mail for Windows. The
utilities can be invoked upon Mail startup by pressing F5 for
compression and pressing SHIFT for integrity checking.

NOTE: Do not invoke MMF integrity checking unless you know your MMF is
corrupted. There is a possibility, depending on the contents of an
attachment, that the Mail client will improperly remove part or all of the
attachment.

MMF Compression
---------------

When a message is deleted, the space it occupied in the MMF is not
released. MMF compression reduces the size of the MMF by changing the
order of active messages to use the free space left by deleted
messages. When the file is compressed, free space at the end of the
file is deleted.

MMF Integrity Checking
----------------------

When the MMF becomes corrupted, it is possible to check and repair it,
depending on the type of corruption. Running an MMF integrity check
may take a few minutes or several hours, depending on the size of the
MMF.
