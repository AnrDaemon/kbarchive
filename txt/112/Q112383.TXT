======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If Novell NetWare version 4.0 is installed as a secondary network, the default
real mode redirector for Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 is the full
redirector, not the basic redirector.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you use the basic redirector with NetWare 4.0 installed as a secondary
network, you may experience the following problems after connecting to several
network drives (using NET USE) and then disconnecting from one of the network
drives (using NET USE /D):

 - The Novell NetWare MAP command no longer functions. You cannot map any drive
   to a NetWare server.

 - The list of redirected drives, viewable by typing NET USE, may not show all
   drives. For example, if you have three drives redirected, the NET USE command
   may show only two.

 - After you stop the basic redirector and start the full redirector, persistent
   network connections may not be restored correctly. For example, a connection
   is not restored, and when you try to manually restore it, you receive an
   error message informing you that the local device is already in use even
   though the Novell MAP command and NET USE commands show that the drive letter
   is not in use.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the above problems:

1. Edit your SYSTEM.INI file and ensure the [Network] section contains the
   following line:

   PreferredRedir=Full

2. Restart your computer and load the full redirector.
