-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1x, 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to create a new postoffice group from within the Mail Administrator
program (ADMIN.EXE), the following error may occur:

   Notice 63 Error
   Creating Group in PO Address List

CAUSE
=====

The warning can be generated as a result of insufficient network rights or file
corruption with the GROUP.GLB file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve, either ensure you have adequate rights to the database (in
particular the GROUP.GLB file) or check for corruption by subtracting 4 from the
GROUP.GLB file size and then dividing by 51. The final figure should be a whole
number.

If corruption exists, either restore from a backup or, if a backup is not
available, reset the PO groups to the same state as per a brand new installation
(for example, No Groups defined):

Delete all files in the MEM subdirectory (if any exist). Install a dummy PO and
copy the GROUP.GLB file (4 bytes) and ADMIN.GRP (8 bytes, also copy this to
ADMINSHD.GRP). This will return the PO to the same state as per a new
installation as far as groups are concerned.

NOTE: The resetting of group files can be automated. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q129500 Automating the Resetting of Group Files using GIMPORT

You can also use debug to reset the GROUP.GLB file and ADMIN.GRP files using
debug.

   debug group.glb
   -f,100,103,0
   -rcx
   CX ????
   :4
   -w
   writing 0004 bytes
   -q

   debug admin.grp
   -f,100,107,0
   -rcx
   CX ????
   :8
   -w
   writing 0008 bytes
   -q

Copy ADMIN.GRP to ADMINSHD.GRP.
