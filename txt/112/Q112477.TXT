TITLE   :_PDRIVER Incorrectly Documented in FoxPro 1.02
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:1.02
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, version 1.02 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The documented functionality of the _PDRIVER variable on page C5-21 in the
"Commands & Functions" manual is incorrect. Microsoft FoxPro version 1.02
does not use any printer drivers; therefore, the _PDRIVER variable is
meaningless to the program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The second paragraph on page C5-21 states:

   _PDRIVER contains a character value that determines which printer driver will
   be used when printing. The default value contained in this variable is the
   default printer driver specified when FoxPro was installed.

   <expC> MUST contain the name of one of the printer drivers supplied with
   FoxPro (see the Appendix for a complete list). The printer driver file name
   that you provide must be valid and must contain a path of the requested
   driver is not in the current default directory.

This text contains several inaccuracies. First, the Appendix does not contain a
list of printer drivers. Second, FoxPro 1.02 does not prompt you for a specific
printer during installation; therefore, no value is stored to the _PDRIVER
variable. Finally, FoxPro 1.02 does not ship with any printer drivers.

The _PDRIVER variable was originally supposed to contain a printer driver.
However, printer drivers were never shipped for FoxPro 1.02.
