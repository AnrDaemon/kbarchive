-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft BallPoint Mouse with QuickPort connection, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows for Workgroups over Windows 3.1, your mouse and
keyboard may stop responding (hang).

This problem occurs if you are using a Toshiba or Texas Instruments original
equipment manufacturer (OEM) Microsoft BallPoint Mouse version 1.0 with
QuickPort connection.

CAUSE
=====

When you install Windows for Workgroups over Windows 3.1, Setup overwrites the
KEYBOARD=BPVKD.386 entry in the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file and
replaces it with the default keyboard driver (KEYBOARD=*VKD). As a result, the
mouse and keyboard hang.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, edit the SYSTEM.INI file and change the keyboard= line
to reflect the BallPoint virtual device driver (VxD) instead of the default
Windows for Workgroups VxD, and then restart Windows for Workgroups.
