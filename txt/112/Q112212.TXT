KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, when you access
user details (by choosing the Address button, selecting an address, and then
choosing Details), the following error message may be displayed:

   Unable to access server files

This error can also occur when you try to add an address to the personal address
book (PAB) and also when Alias.tpl is locked open.

CAUSE
=====

The TPL subdirectory or the ADMIN.INF file is missing or invalid. This error can
also occur if the extended information file (XXXXXXXX.INF) corresponding to an
external postoffice is missing.

RESOLUTION
==========

If either the TPL subdirectory or the ADMIN.INF file is missing, restore it from
a copy or a backup.

To find out if the information in the .INF file is invalid, convert the .INF file
to a text file using steps 1 and 2 on page 155 of the Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks version 3.2 "Administrator's Guide." Compare each record in this text
file for the exact number of fields that match the corresponding .TPL file.
