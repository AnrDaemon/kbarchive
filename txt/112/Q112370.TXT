KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows for Workgroups, you may receive the following error
message:

   The Windows for Workgroups network was not started. Check your
   configuration, or run setup again to set up Windows for Workgroups
   properly.

   The Windows for Workgroups network driver was unable to load.

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs if IFSHLP.SYS is not properly loaded in the
CONFIG.SYS file. Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Setup adds the following line
to the CONFIG.SYS file

   Device=<path>\IFSHLP.SYS

where <path> is the Windows directory. If this line is removed or an older
copy of the CONFIG.SYS file is restored to the machine, and the machine is
configured for the Microsoft Windows Network, this error is displayed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, you must rerun Setup from the original disks or
manually edit the CONFIG.SYS file. Running Network Setup to configure the
network does not correct this problem, nor does running maintenance mode
Setup.
