The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the cover sheet option with Microsoft At Work PC Fax, the date may
not appear on the Date: line of a sent fax.

CAUSE
=====

The date of the sent fax does not appear on the Date: line of the cover sheet if
the sShortDate= line of the [Intl] section in the WIN.INI file is not present or
is invalid.

RESOLUTION
==========

In Control Panel, choose the International icon and choose OK. This adds the
sShortDate= line to the [Intl] section of the WIN.INI file. If the date still
does not appear on a sent fax, the WIN.INI file should be checked for possible
invalid or corrupted entries that would prevent Windows from reading the [Intl]
section properly.

Below is an example of a valid setting for [Intl] section of the WIN.INI file.

      [Intl]
      sLanguage=enu
      sCountry=United States
      iCountry=1
      iDate=0
      iTime=0
      iTLZero=0
      iCurrency=0
      iCurrDigits=2
      iNegCurr=0
      iLzero=1
      iDigits=2
      iMeasure=1
      s1159=AM
      s2359=PM
      sCurrency=$
      sThousand=,
      sDecimal=.
      sDate=/ 
      sTime=:
      sList=,
      sShortDate=M/d/yy
      sLongDate=dddd, MMMM dd, yyyy
