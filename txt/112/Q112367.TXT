The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may be unable to send or receive mail after you delete the MSMAIL.INI file
and re-create a local post office. Also, address books may appear to be empty.

CAUSE
=====

The first time you set up Windows for Workgroups Mail with the "Create a New
Post Office" option, Mail creates a workgroup post office (WGPO) directory
within the Windows directory and creates the MSMAIL.INI file in the Windows
directory.

Deleting the MSMAIL.INI file causes Mail Setup to prompt you to either connect to
an existing post office or create a new workgroup post office. If you choose to
create a new post office, a WGPO directory is created in
<drive>:\<Windows directory>\WGPO.

In Setup, you cannot select the Windows directory as the parent of the WGPO
directory, and there is no option to use the previously created post office.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

1. Open the MSMAIL.INI file located in the Windows directory with an ASCII text
   editor, such as Windows Notepad.

2. Change the ServerPath= entry in the [Microsoft Mail] section to indicate the
   first WGPO directory. For example

   change

      [Microsoft Mail]
      ServerPath=C:\WINDOWS\WGPO\WGPO\ 

   to:

      [Microsoft Mail]
      ServerPath=C:\WINDOWS\WGPO\ 

3. Delete the C:\WINDOWS\WGPO\WGPO directory.
