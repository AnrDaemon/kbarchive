-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1x, 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: MS-DOS 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message may appear when you access mail messages from the
MS-DOS client:

   Notice 13
   Disk Full or Error Writing to Disk

CAUSE
=====

This error can be caused by inadequate network rights.

If you can send normal mail messages but have problems when you send mail with
attachments, this error can also be caused by missing ATT subdirectories.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure you have adequate network rights. If subdirectories are missing from
the ATT directory, either restore them from a backup copy or, if no backup
exists, create them using the MS-DOS MD command.

NOTE: If you don't restore from backup copies but you just re-create the missing
subdirectories, any attachments in the directory prior to its loss will no
longer be available.

Missing subdirectories are often a result of backup and restore processes that
are not configured to include empty directories or zero-length files.

If you move a database (for example, from drive M to drive P), the following
XCOPY command ensures all directories are re-created on the destination drive:

   xcopy m:\*.* /s /e p:
