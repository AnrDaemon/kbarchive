TITLE   :PC DirSync: Err Msg: Fatal Error 2 Opening File: MSTTRANS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.2,3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error may be reported in the DIRSYNC.LOG file for the server
postoffice when you run directory synchronization (Dir-Sync):

   Warning [ 2] Error opening file: MSTTRANS
   Fatal [ 2] Error opening file: MSTTRANS

CAUSE
=====

The MSTTRANS.GLB file is missing from the GLB directory on the Dir-Sync server
postoffice.

RESOLUTION
==========

The best resolution is to restore the MSTTRANS.GLB file from a backup copy and
have all requestor postoffices perform a Dir-Sync Export (by starting the Mail
Administrator program [ADMIN.EXE], under Config, Dir-Sync Requestor, Export).

If a backup copy of the postoffice is not available, the resolution depends on
the version of Mail that is running:

For Mail 3.0
------------

1. Create a new MSTTRANS.GLB file by using the following MS-DOS command from
   within the GLB directory of the server postoffice:

   type nul > msttrans.glb

2. Turn off the Dir-Sync server from the Mail Administrator program (by
   selecting Config, Dir-Sync, Options, No, Yes).

3. Use the LISTDS utility to reset the REQCONF.GLB file on all the postoffices
   participating in Dir-Sync. If this utility is not available, install a dummy
   postoffice and copy the REQCONF.GLB file from the dummy postoffice to all the
   GLB directories of all postoffices participating in Dir-Sync.

4. Turn on the Dir-Sync server again from the Mail Administrator program (by
   selecting Config, Dir-Sync, Options, Yes).

5. Re-register all of the requestors with the Dir-Sync server by selecting
   Config, Dir-Sync, Server, Requestors, Create, Networks, and selecting each
   requestor you want to register with the Dir-Sync server.

6. Select Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Export to export the server[ASCII 146]s
   address list.

7. Reconfigure all the requestors to go to the Dir-Sync server (by selecting
   Config, Dir-Sync Requestor, Registration), and export the address list (by
   selecting Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Export)

For Mail 3.2 and 3.5
--------------------

1. Create a new MSTTRANS.GLB file by using the following MS-DOS command from
   within the GLB directory of the server postoffice:

   type nul > msttrans.glb

2. Export all the address lists of all requestors from the Mail Administrator
   program (by selecting Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Export.

   NOTE: Errors 138 and 139 will be generated by Dir-Sync in the DIRSYNC.LOG file
   for all the requestors; however, you can ignore these errors because as the
   Export operation will cover any transactions lost due to the missing
   MSTTRANS.GLB file.
