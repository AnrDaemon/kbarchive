The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In versions 3.0b and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, a return receipt is
marked and handled as a high-priority mail message, regardless of the actual
priority set for that message. This is designed to match the way the MS-DOS
workstation handles registered mail.

To translate between the two clients:

   MS-DOS priority    -> Windows priority
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

        1                     Low
        2                     Normal
        3                     Normal
        4                     High
        5                     High
        R                     High, with Return Receipt
 
 
   Windows priority   ->   MS-DOS priority
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

      Low                      1
      Normal                   3
      High                     4 or 5 (see ** below)
      Return Receipt           R

There is no way to distinguish between a message with high priority and a message
with a return receipt in the Windows client. Both messages appear with an
exclamation point (!) to the left of the icon in the From: heading.

** The Windows client high priority is 5 if the user has been given urgent
privileges through the Mail Administrator program; otherwise, it is 4.
