-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When modem scripts (.SCR files) are found in the same location as user data
files during the update-user-data process of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows,
the scripts will be installed along with the user data, replacing older versions
(if any).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Any time you are prompted for a directory containing user data files, if in
addition to the data files, .SCR files are found, then the .SCR files are copied
to the proper directory. However, those scripts are not automatically selected
as being the current script used by Remote Mail for Windows.

This provides a very convenient method for installing scripts. The administrator
can simply include it on the data disk.

Scripts on the datadisk will become the master scripts. If you have a script on
the data disk that has the same name as one on your distribution disk or already
installed in the client workstation, the one on the data disk will be the one
that gets installed.
