The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Multimedia Schubert for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run Schubert on a system with the ATI Mach 32 video driver, you may find
that some button text is clipped or cut off. This problem occurs if you selected
Large Fonts in the ATI advanced features control panel.

For example, in the Close Reading chapter, the button text "IV: THEME &
VARIATIONS: ANDANTINO" may be cut off on the end.

The button text is in Millicent SmallCaps. In Large Fonts mode there is no font
available that is small enough to fit the text properly within the button area.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, use the Small Fonts option with this video driver. You
can select this option in the ATI control panel.
