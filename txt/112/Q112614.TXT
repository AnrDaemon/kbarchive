======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you choose to add or remove Windows components within the Windows Setup
program, the Add/Remove Windows Components selection under Options is
unavailable.

CAUSE
=====

This option is unavailable if an administrative setup has been performed. The
purpose of an administrative setup (one in which the /A and /N options are used)
is to configure a workstation to run Windows from a shared directory.

Because Windows is being run from a shared directory, the Add/Remove Windows
option is intentionally unavailable to keep users from deleting files that are
used by others.
