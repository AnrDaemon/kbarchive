The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS, version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you type "net start server" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS
command prompt, you may receive the following messages if you have created four
or more shares:

 - Cannot Share (ERROR 2119)

 - Insufficient Memory to perform this operation

CAUSE
=====

The maximum number of shares the MS-DOS peer server can support by default is
three.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, add the MaxShares= entry to the [network] section
of the SYSTEM.INI file to increase the maximum number of supported shares.

For example:

      [network]
      MaxShares=10
