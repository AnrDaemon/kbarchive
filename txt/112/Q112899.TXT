TITLE   :PC WRmt: Problems Mixing Language Versions of Mail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows over a
pre-existing version of Microsoft Mail for Windows of a different language, you
will get an error message that states the MSSFS.DLL can not be found.

You also get an incorrect message similar to:

   Currently version 3.02 of MSMAIL.EXE is installed and supports French. The
   software you are installing supports US English. Should the copy be over
   written?"

NOTE: The incorrect version number is displayed; there is no version 3.02.

CAUSE
=====

Mail Remote for Windows requires that you install the same language version of
Mail Remote for Windows as you use for Mail for Windows. If different language
versions are used, you will receive the error.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
Remote for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Assume you are installing German Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows over English
Microsoft Mail for Windows. Setup looks in MSMAILPV.INI for the current driver.
The current driver string is localized, so Setup will find the current driver
string, Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.

Setup will then compare this string with the German version. The compare will
fail, and Setup will then assume that there is no current driver. It will then
look for stranded Microsoft Mail for Windows LAN Driver files and move them to
<windows>\MSMAIL\MSMAIL, so the MSSFS.DLL driver will not be found in its
old location.
