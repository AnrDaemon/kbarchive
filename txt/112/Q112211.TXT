SUMMARY
=======

The conversion utility (CONVERT.EXE) for versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
For Windows changes the sort order of both parent and child folders to be by
date. CONVERT.EXE does not read the folder attribute from the .IDX file.
Therefore, the messages stored in the folders are automatically sorted by date,
which is the default.


Additional query words: 3.00 3.20
