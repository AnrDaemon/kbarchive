TITLE   :PRB: SET TALK ON Does Not Work with SET STATUS BAR ON
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.5b,3.0b; WINDOWS:2.5,2.5a,2.5b,3.0,3.0b,5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.5b 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SET TALK command is ON, but command output does not display on the desktop.

CAUSE
=====

The SET STATUS BAR command is ON. This displays a Windows-style status bar,
which prevents the display of the command output controlled by the SET TALK
command.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the character-based status bar, which is displayed by the command SET STATUS
ON.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In FoxPro for MS-DOS, any time the SET TALK command is ON, command output is
displayed in the active output area (usually the desktop). In FoxPro for Windows
and Visual FoxPro, however, the type of status bar in effect determines whether
the SET TALK output is displayed.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Type the following in the Command window:

         SET TALK ON
         SET STATUS BAR ON
         x = "test"

   Note that the character string "test" does not display on the desktop.

2. Type the following in the Command window:

         SET STATUS ON
         x = "test"

Note that the character string "test" now displays on the desktop.

Windows and FoxPro for Macintosh, please see the following article in the
