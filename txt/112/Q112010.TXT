TITLE   :FIX: Access Violation on READ of Exported COMMON Array
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to READ an array element that is exported from a COMMON block in a
dynamic-link library (DLL) may generate an access violation message box under
Windows NT.

CAUSE
=====

This run-time error occurs when the data is read from an external file. This
error does not occur with WRITE statements or when reading COMMON variables.

RESOLUTION
==========

READ exported COMMON data into local allocatable arrays, and then assign these
arrays to the arrays in the exported COMMON block.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation for Windows
NT, version 1.0. Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The sample below illustrates the problem:

Sample Code
-----------

   c MAIN Source Code
   c Compile options required: none
   c Linker options required: include the import library for the DLL.
   c

         interface to subroutine bar[dllimport]()
         end
         common /bridge[dllimport]/ i
         integer*4 i(4)
         open(3,file='main.inp')
         read(3,*) i(1)
         close(3)
         call bar
         end
   c DLL Source Code
   c Compile options required: /LD
   c

         subroutine bar[dllexport]()
         common /bridge[dllexport]/ i
         integer*4 i(4)
         write(*,*) 'In DLL:'
         return
         end
