TITLE   :Multimedia: Display Looks Bad with Orchid Fahrenheit 1280
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Multimedia Schubert for Windows, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Multimedia Mozart for Windows, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Multimedia Stravinsky for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Schubert, Mozart, or Stravinsky on a computer that is using the
Orchid Fahrenheit 1280 16-color video driver, the display may look strange. For
example, Schubert may display primarily in black and yellow. Also, when you
enter some chapters (such as Close Reading in Schubert) buttons and controls may
leave outlines behind on the screen when you switch pages.

This problem occurs because the installation program does not correctly detect
that Windows is running in 16 colors, and instead installs the 256-color version
of the application. The 256-color screens cannot display properly on a system
that is running in 16-color mode.

The installation program should detect that the system is running in 16-color
mode and install the 16-color version of the application.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Schubert version 1.0, Stravinsky
version 1.0, and Mozart version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.

RESOLUTION
==========

If possible, switch to a 256-color video driver that supports your video card.
256 colors is the recommended color mode for Schubert, Mozart, and Stravinsky.

If a 256-color video driver is not available, load the Windows 3.1 VGA video
driver, through Windows Setup, and re-install the application. Running the Setup
program with the VGA driver loaded will ensure that the 16-color mode is
correctly detected and thus the 16-color version of the application will be
installed.

For information about changing your video mode, refer to pages 557-560 of the
"Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for Windows 3.1.
