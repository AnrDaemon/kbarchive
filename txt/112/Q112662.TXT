SYMPTOMS
========

Starting Microsoft Golf 1.0 may cause the following error when you run Golf on a
system that is also running Imaginaria:

   MSGOLF caused a General Protection Fault in module KRNL38.EXE @ 0001:30A9.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when Imaginaria by Claris is loaded on a system.

RESOLUTION
==========

Removing Imaginaria or remarking out the lines that load it in the system's
AUTOEXEC.BAT and WIN.INI files solves the problem. To correct this problem,
disable Imaginaria.

1. In Program Manager, choose Run from the File menu.

2. In the Command Line box, type "sysedit" (without the quotation marks) and
   choose OK.

3. In the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, type "REM" (without the quotation marks) in front
   of the line \imagnaria\imgn_dos.com.

4. In the WIN.INI file, place a single semicolon (;) in front of the LOAD= line
   on which Imaginaria is resident.

5. Save the changes and exit the System Configuration Editor.

6. Exit Windows and restart your computer. Start Windows and run Microsoft Golf.
   The problem should now be resolved.
