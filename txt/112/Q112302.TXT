TITLE   :PC Win: Exporting Folders Err Msg: Not Enough Memory...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, the following
error message may be displayed when you try to export folders:

   STOP: There is not enough memory or system resources to complete this action.
   Try closing some windows and performing the action again.

CAUSE
=====

This message can occur if there is a backslash (\) at the end of the directory
path following the ExportMmfFile entry in the MSMAIL.INI file.

The following is an example of an incorrect entry:

   [Microsoft Mail]
   ExportMmfFile=C:\WINDOWS\

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, use an ASCII text editor (such as NOTEPAD.EXE) to
remove the backslash following the path name (in this example, WINDOWS). For
example:

   [Microsoft Mail]
   ExportMmfFile=C:\WINDOWS

Adding any valid characters following the backslash will also result in the
low-memory error:

   [Microsoft Mail]
   ExportMmfFile=C:\WINDOWS\MYFILE.MMF

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0 and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
