TITLE   :FIX: F6422 on Unformatted File Opened with ACCESS='APPEND'
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to CLOSE, REWIND, or BACKSPACE an unformatted file that was opened
with ACCESS='APPEND' produces the run-time error:

   run-time error F6422:
   - no space left on device

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not open unformatted files with ACCESS='APPEND'. Read to the end of the
unformatted file and then start writing the new information. Another solution is
to use FORM='BINARY' with ACCESS= 'APPEND'.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0
for MS-DOS. This problem has been resolved with FORTRAN PowerStation maintenance
release version 1.0a for MS-DOS.

FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0 can be differentiated from the maintenance
release version 1.0a by invoking the linker. Typing "link32 | more" (without the
quotation marks) from \F32\BIN directory will show version 2.8 for FORTRAN
PowerStation version 1.0, and it will show version 1.0f for the maintenance
release version 1.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample produces the F6422 error with Fortran PowerStation for
MS-DOS version 1.0, but does not with version 1.0a.

Sample Code #1
--------------

   Compile options: None
         open (1,file='newfile.dat',form='unformatted')
         do j=1,2
            write(1) j
         enddo
         close(1)
         open (1,file='newfile.dat',form='unformatted',access='append')
         do j=1,2
            write(1) j
         enddo
         close(1)  ! F6422 here
         end

Obtain the functionality of ACCESS='APPEND' by reading to the end of the file
before writing the appended records. This is shown in the sample below:

Sample Code #2
--------------

   Compile options: None
         open (1,file='newfile.dat',form='unformatted')
         do j=1,2
            write(1) j
         enddo
         close(1)
         open (1,file='newfile.dat',form='unformatted')
         do while (.not.EOF(1))
            read(1) j           ! READ to end of file
         enddo
         do j=1,2
            write(1) j          ! APPEND additional information
         enddo
         close(1)
         end
