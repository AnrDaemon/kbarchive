SUMMARY
=======

A number of FoxPro functions use a function key as a hot, or shortcut, key;
however, many Macintosh systems use keyboards that do not have function keys. To
emulate function keys on these systems, you can use a
CONTROL+COMMAND+<number> key combination.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The hot key to bring the Command window forward is COMMAND+F2. FoxPro for
Macintosh treats the CTRL and COMMAND keys the same, allowing users that don't
have function keys to mimic the COMMAND+<function key> combination. To do
this, hold both the CTRL and COMMAND keys down while pressing the number of the
function key to activate. For example, the Command window hot key combination
would be CTRL+COMMAND+2 instead of COMMAND+F2. To cycle through active windows,
the key combination would be CTRL+COMMAND+1 instead of COMMAND+F1.
