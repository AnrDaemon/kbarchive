TITLE   :FIX: Access Violation with Pass by Value and -Ox -G3
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCompiler kbFL32 kbFortranPSkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using FORTRAN PowerStation for Windows NT to compile subprograms that pass
arguments by value (either by using [C] or [VALUE]) may produce an "access
violation" application error message box when compiling with both -G3 and - Ox.

CAUSE
=====

This compile-time error appears to be caused by either passing mismatched
arguments by value, or by passing expressions by value in the argument list.

RESOLUTION
==========

When using -G3 and -Ox and passing by value, always match argument lengths and
types and do not pass expressions.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation
for Windows NT, version 1.0. This problem was corrected in FORTRAN PowerStation
32, version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample passes expressions by value, and will cause the compiler to
generate an access violation when compiling with -G3 -Ox:

Sample Code
-----------

   c Compile options needed: -G3 -Ox
   c
           subroutine s[c](rr,r4,r8,rt,rs)
           real*8 r8
           write(*,*) rr, r4, r8, rt,rs
           end

           real*8 r8 /0.d0/ 
           r4 = 0.
           rr = 0.
           rs = 0.
           rt = 0.
           call s(rr, r4,     r8,     rt, rs)
           call s(rr, r4+1.0, r8-1.0, rt, rs)
           end
