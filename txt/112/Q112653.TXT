TITLE   :WFWG 3.11 Err Msg: Network Modules Not Loaded
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Running FTP.EXE from TCP Utilities after installing that software package under
Windows for Workgroups may generate the following error message:

   Network modules not loaded. Program aborted.

CAUSE
=====

A number of the utilities in the TCP Utilities package (for example, FTP.EXE)
parse the CONFIG.SYS file for the following device statement:

        DEVICE=C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTMAN\PROTMAN.DOS /I:C:\WINDOWS

If this statement does not exist, FTP.EXE does not load and displays the
aforementioned error. FTP.EXE is hard coded to search for the location of the
TCPUTILS.INI file using the "/I:C:\Windows" part of the PROTMAN.DOS device
statement. TCPUTILS.INI must reside at the location specified by the /I: switch
on the PROTMAN.DOS line.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, create the following device statement in the CONFIG.SYS
file:

   DEVICE=C:\PROTMAN\PROTMAN.DOS /I:C:\WINDOWS

This modification results in a "Bad or missing C:\PROTMAN\PROTMAN.DOS error" when
you start your computer; however, it is safe to ignore this error.
