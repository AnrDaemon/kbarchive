TITLE   :How to Use Workgroup Add-On and WFWG 3.11 on Same Computer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Access Distribution Kit
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.11; WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS, version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS on the
same machine, a black screen appears when you start Windows for Workgroups, or
the following error messages are displayed:

   Invalid VxD dynamic link call to device number 0028, service 8031.

   Invalid VxD dynamic link call to device number 0028, service 800A.

CAUSE
=====

With Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS, if a NET SHARE command is issued to give the
workstation server capabilities, the Workgroup Add-On network services must be
stopped from its own directory in order for Windows for Workgroups to initialize
properly. For example, the following command must be issued to stop the
Workgroup Add-On network:

   C:\NET\NET STOP

The NET STOP command must be issued from the Workgroup Add-On directory (in this
example, C:\NET) or Windows for Workgroups cannot run.

RESOLUTION
==========

Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS and Windows for Workgroups 3.11 can be run
successfully on the same machine if certain conditions are met. Entries in the
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files need to be initialized from the Windows for
Workgroups directory to generate full functionality of both products. If
Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS was installed after Windows for Workgroups 3.11, the
following changes need to be made:

1. Edit the CONFIG.SYS file as follows

   Change

      DEVICE=C:\NET\IFSHLP.SYS

   to:

      DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\IFSHLP.SYS

2. Edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file as follows

   Change

      C:\NET\NET START

   to:

      C:\WINDOWS\NET START

To start the network services for Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS, change to the
Workgroup Add-On directory and type the appropriate NET START command. To avoid
problems, ensure that a NET STOP command is issued from within the Workgroup
Add-On directory before you start Windows for Workgroups.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can simplify the logon and logoff procedures for Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS
by using batch files. To log on, create a one-line batch file that reads
"C:\NET\NET START" and name it START.BAT. To log off, create a one-line batch
file that reads "@ECHO Y | C:\NET STOP" and name it STOP.BAT. To log on, type
"start" (without the quotation marks); to log off, type "stop" (without the
quotation marks).

NOTE: You can also add "win" (without the quotation marks) as the last line in
the STOP.BAT file to log off and start Windows automatically.
