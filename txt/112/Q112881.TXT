======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1x, 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.0a, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, when you
add new users to the postoffice address list (POL), the following error may
occur:

   Notice 58
   PO Address List Already has Alias With this Name

CAUSE
=====

You may have a user defined with the same alias (full name). Although the
mailbox name may be different, you may be using a "generic" alias (for example,
Test User).

If the alias is original to the postoffice, file corruption can also be the
cause. The Access files (ACCESS.GLB, ACCESS.GLB, and ACCESS3.GLB) should be
checked and divided using the following figures:

NOTE: Even if the files divide to a whole number, it does not guarantee that they
are not corrupt.

   ACCESS.GLB      divide by      586
   ACCESS2.GLB     divide by       69
   ACCESS3.GLB     divide by      512

The ADMIN.NME and ADMINSHD.NME files can be checked; they should be the same size
and date stamp. The ADMIN.NME file should be divisible by 45.

RESOLUTION
==========

If corruption exists with any of the three Access files, restore from backup.
The complete list of files to restore are:

 - ACCESS.GLB

 - ACCESS2.GLB

 - ACCESS3.GLB

 - ADMIN.NME

 - ADMINSHD.NME

 - ADMIN.GRP

 - ADMINSHD.GRP

All the files should be restored from the most recent valid backup. If users have
been added to the mail system since the last backup, these users will have to be
redefined after the restoration.

For Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation:

   Users should make an archive of their mail folders and Inbox prior to
   restoring the files that can be unarchived upon recreation of the mailbox.

For Mail for Windows:

   Users should make a backup of their MMF file prior to restoring the files
   that can be re-imported using the Import Folders option upon recreation of
   their mailbox.

If the ADMIN.NME file is corrupt, you can run ACCTONME.EXE to regenerate it. The
corrupt ADMIN.NME file will need to be "zeroed out" using the following method:

   Delete the file, and use the following command:

   " type AAA > ADMIN.NME " (without the quotation marks)

This will create a zero length ADMIN.NME file.

ACCTONME can then be run from the root of the mail database. Copy the newly
generated ADMIN.NME file to ADMINSHD.NME.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For additional information on how the external users and groups in the
postoffice address list might be salvaged before running ACCTONME, please see
