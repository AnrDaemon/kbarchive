SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Microsoft At Work PC Fax, you may no longer be able to send
mail to users sharing the same post office. When you send a message to a member
of the post office, the message returns with an "Undeliverable Mail" error
message. The text of the mail message reads

   The message recipient was invalid.

-or-

   The PostOffice List icon in the Address Book may be unavailable in Microsoft
   Mail.

-or-

   The Open Other's Appt. Book option may be unavailable in Microsoft Schedule+.

CAUSE
=====

If Microsoft Mail was installed with Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version
3.1 and you choose to install Microsoft At Work PC Fax for "Fax Only" rather
than "Email And Fax" in Windows for Workgroups 3.11, the MSMAIL.INI file is not
properly updated.

RESOLUTION
==========

If Microsoft Mail was not installed before you started At Work PC Fax, make the
following changes:

1. Rename the following files:

   MSMAIL.INI
   EFAXPUMP.INI
   SCHDPLUS.INI.

2. Choose the Fax icon in Control Panel.

3. Select the Email And Fax option and choose OK.

4. Select the appropriate settings for your fax board.

5. Install Microsoft Mail.

If Microsoft Mail was installed prior to starting At Work PC Fax, do the
following:

1. Remove the [Providers] section of the MSMAIL.INI file.

2. Rename the EFAXPUMP.INI file.

   NOTE: If you are receiving the following error message when starting Microsoft
   Schedule+

   Your schedule transport DLL does not support the current transport. You will
   only be able to work off-line. PCMail users are supported.

   also perform the following step:

   a. In the SCHDPLUS.INI file, remove the following statement:

          ScheduleTransport=TRNOFF
        

      NOTE: The "ScheduleTransport=TRNOFF" entry in the SCHPLUS.INI file causes
      the "This account is for a resource" check box in the Schedule Plus
      Options dialog box to be unavailable.

      -or-

      Rename the SCHDPLUS.INI file.

3. Choose the Fax icon in Control Panel.

4. Select the Email And Fax option and choose OK.

5. Select the appropriate settings for your fax board.
