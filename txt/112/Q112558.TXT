SUMMARY
=======

Page 192 of the of the Microsoft Windows NT 3.1 "System Guide" or page 213 of
the Microsoft Windows NT 3.5 "System Guide" describes the separator files that
are included with Windows NT 3.1. The documentation suggests that PCL.SEP only
"switches [a] printer to PCL printing." This is not completely correct, PCL.SEP
also causes a separator page to be printed in front of the print job.
SYSPRINT.SEP is not mentioned at all in the description under the heading "Using
Separator Files."

MORE INFORMATION
================

SYSPRINT.SEP is one of the four separator files installed by default on a
Windows NT system in the %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32 directory. The other three files
are PSLANMAN.SEP, PCL.SEP, and PSCRIPT.SEP. PSCRIPT.SEP functions as the
documentation states, it does not print a separator page at the beginning of the
document, but it does switch the printer to PostScript printing. The DEFAULT.SEP
file mentioned in the documentation on page 192 does not actually exist.

SYSPRINT.SEP is a PostScript-compatible separator file that has virtually the
same functionality as the PSLANMAN.SEP file. That is, it prints a separator page
at the beginning of each document. The only real difference between SYSPRINT.SEP
and PSLANMAN.SEP is that there is some error handling code at the beginning of
the SYSPRINT.SEP file which is not found in the PSLANMAN.SEP file.
