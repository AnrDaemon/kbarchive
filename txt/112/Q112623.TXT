SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using the Intel EtherExpress 16 MCA network interface card (NIC) with
an NDIS 3.0 driver, you may be unable to see or connect to other machines on the
network. Switching to the real mode (NDIS 2.0) driver allows you to see and
connect to other workstations normally.

RESOLUTION
==========

Intel has an updated .ADF file that allows the Intel EtherExpress 16 MCA NIC to
work with the NDIS 3.0 driver.

E16ADF.EXE can be downloaded from Intel's bulletin board service. This is a
self-extracting executable file that contains the following two files:

   @628B.ADF     8561     9/1/93
   README.TXT

The old .ADF file has the file date 7/28/92.


Please contact your hardware manufacturer for any assistance or information
concerning reconfiguring your MicroChannel computer with the updated .ADF file.

The products included here are manufactured by Intel, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
