TITLE   :PC WSPlus: Access Privileges Invalid After Using MOVEUSER
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After MOVEUSER.EXE moves an account from one postoffice to another, on different
servers, the following error message appears:

   The schedule file could not be opened. You may not have the necessary access
   privileges or the file may be unavailable.

When you attempt to open someone's .CAL file, Schedule+ checks your .CAL file to
see if you have access privileges or not. Access privileges are given according
to the 10/10/10 addressing scheme used by Microsoft Mail. A 10/10/10 address
corresponds to the following: Network name/Postoffice name/User account name.
Should the address in the .CAL file you wish to access not match your address,
you will not be able to access the .CAL file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To solve this problem, the user that was moved, needs to go into Options, Set
Access Privileges to remove and re-establish user access privileges for all
accounts that can no longer access their calendar file after it was moved.

NOTE: When re-establishing accounts, make sure you choose their names from either
the Global Address List or Postoffice Address List so that their 10/10/10
addresses will be used.

Additional query words: schedule plus 1.00a
