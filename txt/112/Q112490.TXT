-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Multimedia Schubert for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run Schubert under Microsoft Windows NT, some of the Schubert dialog
boxes or screens may display with incorrect fonts. The items that display with
incorrect fonts under Windows NT include the following:

 - Subtitles in Help

 - Titles and picture captions in A Classical Background

 - Titles and picture captions in Inside Schubert

 - Page 31 of A Classical Background

The following two display problems also may occur:

 - If you click the Transition In Exposition play button, text will appear in
   the wrong font.

   -and-

 - If there are quotation marks in any of the controls, they will appear as
   squares.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Schubert version 1.0 when running
under Windows NT. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To eliminate this problem, use Schubert with Windows version 3.1. This is the
recommended configuration for Schubert.
