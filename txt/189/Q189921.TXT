TITLE   :PRB: Mailto: Hyperlink Object Starts Internet Explorer in Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the Mailto: URL syntax with the HyperLink object to send e-mail causes
Internet Explorer to launch before the new mail message window appears.

CAUSE
=====

The API used by the HyperLink object does not support the Mailto: and File:
links.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code:

         oX=NewObject("HyperLink")
         oX.NavigateTo("mailto:myemail@mydomain.com")

Internet Explorer appears before the new mail message window.

WORKAROUND
----------

To work around this behavior, use the FoxPro Foundation Classes' _ShellExecute
class.

   loRunIt = NEWOBJECT("_ShellExecute", HOME() + "ffc\_environ.vcx")
   loRunIt.ShellExecute("mailto:myEmail@myDomain.com")
