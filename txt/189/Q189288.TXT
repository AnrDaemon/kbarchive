TITLE   :XADM: Exchange Administrator Generates Dr. Watson Errors
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start the Exchange Server Administrator program (Admin.exe),
it generates an immediate Dr Watson error. No additional errors are recorded in
the application log.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT system path has been altered or deleted.

WORKAROUND
==========

In order to operate, Admin.exe must have full access to %SystemRoot%\system32
and %SystemRoot%.

To verify this, at a command prompt, type PATH <Enter>. Be sure that this
displays the actual path (for example: C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32;C:\WINNT) and not the
system variables referenced above.

The system path can be changed in the Control Panel Systems icon on the
Environment tab. When this information is accurate, the Exchange Server
Administration Program can be viewed without a Dr. Watson.

Additional query words: PATH WATSON ADMIN
