-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Explorer for Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98, on platform(s):
    - Microsoft Windows 95 
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When using the Outlook Deployment Kit (ODK) to install Outlook 98,
administrators may want to keep the Outlook Express icon from showing on the
users' desktops. This article provides instructions for using the Ol98qfe2.exe
utility to remove the OE icon to help administrators who have not used the
custom components feature before.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An executable utility, Ol98qfe2.exe, can be packaged in the ODK build process
that will keep the icon for Outlook Express (OE) from being created. The
executable needs to be packaged in the ODK build and it will run silently during
the setup process.

NOTE: If Internet Explorer 4.01 Service Pack 1 is already installed, you cannot
use the Ol98qfe2.exe utility to remove the OE icon. It will not remove the icon
if it already exists.

What It Will Do
---------------

If Internet Explorer is not installed before running the ODK Setup, then the OE
icon will never be created. If Internet Explorer has been installed before
setup, and you have deleted the OE icon from your users' desktops, the icon will
not appear. If Internet Explorer has been installed, and the OE icon is on the
desktop, this utility will remove the icon.

There is one command-line option, the /Q switch, which allows the utility to run
silently. If the switch is not used, the utility will prompt for confirmation to
keep the icon from being created.

The following steps must be followed to add the utility to your ODK
installation:

1. Begin the installation process following the steps in the wizard. The seventh
   screen, entitled "Specify Custom Active Setup Components," will appear.

2. Click the Add button. The Component field will be populated with New Custom
   Component #1. Change the package title in the Component field, for example,
   Outlook Express Icon Tool.

3. Click the Browse button, and select Ol98qfe2.exe from the appropriate
   directory. If you want the utility to install silently, put a /Q in the
   Parameters field.

4. Follow the wizard steps to the thirteenth screen in the ODK build process,
   entitled Select Installation Options. In the left pane, you will see the
   Components Available window. In this window, the last entry will be the name
   of your custom component. Our example was Outlook Express Icon Tool.

5. Select this entry, and click the Next button so that this component will be
   installed during Setup. This is the final step to install the utility
   automatically during an ODK installation.

There are many other options for adding custom components that are documented in
the ODK, such as using the IExpress tool to create a custom package that
contains many different components in one single package, signing the package,
and so on. For more information about using the Outlook Deployment Kit, see the
