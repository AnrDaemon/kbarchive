SYMPTOMS
========

When you use an Outlook or Exchange client to access your mailbox, checking the
Sent Items folder may show nothing even though you have selected "Save Copies of
Messages in Sent Items folder" in the Options menu.

CAUSE
=====

This can occur if the default views have changed and are filtering for messages
that do not meet any of the selected criteria.

WORKAROUND
==========

Set the folder views back to the default settings or modify the current folder
views to allow characteristics that will allow messages to be seen. This
situation can occur with any folders in your mailbox if the filters for views
are set incorrectly. For instance, selecting messages "Flagged for Next Seven
Days" in the View menu may display nothing in the folder if there are no
messages that meet this criteria.
