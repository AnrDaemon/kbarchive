TITLE   :XCON: Exchange MTA Logs Event 1136
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send messages from a third-party message transfer agent (MTA) to
Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 using the X.400 Connector, sending may fail and
the Event 1136 may be logged as follows:

   An interoperability error occurred with entity
   /O=Org/OU=Site/CN=CONFIGURATION/CN=CONNECTIONS/CN=X400.
   A reliable transport service element (RTSE) error occurred.
   ASN.1 decode failure.
   Server error code 164 was detected at offset 28711.
   Node label Pusep.
   Control block index 2001. [PLATFORM RTSE 31 151] (14)

CAUSE
=====

This error is only logged, if the third-party MTA uses a large checkpoint size,
64 for example. The error is very dependent on the size of the message or
attachment. The error may occur when you send attachments of a very specific
size and not with others that are a little smaller or larger. Setting the
checkpoint size to a lower value, for example to 15, resolves the issue.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
