KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) version 3.0 with
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 or 5.5, and you try to open the Exchange
Server 5.0 Active Server Pages or the Exchange Server 5.5 Outlook Web Access
(OWA) pages, you receive the following error messages when using Microsoft
Internet Explorer version 3.02:

   HTTP/1.0 403 access forbidden

And the following error message when using Microsoft Internet Explorer version
4.0:

   HTTP/1.0 invalid application name

Using IIS 4.0 with Exchange Server 5.5 and trying to open up the OWA pages may
produce the following error message:

   Directory Listing Denied. The virtual directory does not allow contents
   to be listed.

CAUSE
=====

These errors occurs when the Exchange Server Virtual Directory is set to be the
IIS home directory.

The Exchange Active Server Components for Exchange Server 5.0 or the Outlook Web
Access components for Exchange Server 5.5 are coded to use the /Exchange alias

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Do not use the Exchange Virtual Directory as an IIS home directory.

 - The Exchange Virtual Directory can be used as a virtual server.

 - Create a Default.htm file in the root of the IIS server to jump directly into
   the Exchange Virtual Directory. See sample below.
