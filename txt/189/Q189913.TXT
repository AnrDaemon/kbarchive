TITLE   :BUG: Inconsistent Firing of ListBox Click Event Using Keyboard
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbcode

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When navigating through a list box using the keyboard, you will see different
behavior with the firing of the Click event depending on your method of
navigation.

For example, using the Up/Down arrow keys will fire the Click event, while using
the PageUp/PageDown keys will not cause the Click event to fire.

RESOLUTION
==========

For more consistent results navigating in a list box with the keyboard, it is
recommended that you use the list box's InterActiveChange event rather than the
Click event.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

            Width = 249
            DoCreate = .T.
            Caption = "Form1"
            Name = "Form1"
            ADD OBJECT list1 AS listbox WITH ;
               RowSourceType = 1, ;

               Left = 24, ;
               Top = 12, ;
               Width = 205, ;
               Name = "List1"
            PROCEDURE list1.Click
               WAIT WINDOW NOWAIT this.value
            ENDPROC
         ENDDEFINE

2. Use the Up/Down arrow keys.

   NOTE: The Click event fires, bringing up the WAIT WINDOW.

3. Use the PageUp/PageDown keys.

NOTE: The Click event never fires.
