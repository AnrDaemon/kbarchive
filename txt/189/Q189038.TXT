TITLE   :DHCP Server Cannot Be Accessed with Dhcpadmin.exe Tool
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFEA kbWinNT400sp4fea

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

 

SYMPTOMS
========

On a computer running Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 4, when you start the
DHCP Manager from a DHCP server running Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 3 (for
example, \\server\c$\WINNT\system32\Dhcpadmn.exe) and then double-click the DHCP
Server, DHCP Manager fails with the following error:

   Unable to connect to DHCP server at X.X.X.X.
   Server may be down, or DHCP service not started.

CAUSE
=====

When you run the Dhcpadmin.exe utility from the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder on
a server running an earlier Service Pack version, the program will use the
supporting *.dll files from this network directory instead of the local
%SystemRoot%\System32 folder, which causes incompatibilities on the system.

RESOLUTION
==========

For DHCP manager to function properly on the workstation:

1. Install the DCHPadmn.exe utility on the workstation from the Windows NT 4.0
   Server compact disc, Clients\srvtools\winnt\setup.bat.

2. Reapply Service Pack 4 to the system to update these files.

NOTE: Rename the $ntservicepackuninstall$ folder so that it will not be
overwritten when reinstalling Service pack 4.
