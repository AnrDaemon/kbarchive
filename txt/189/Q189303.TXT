PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running Setup for Systems Management Server Service Packs, the Upgrade
button in the Site Operations window is unavailable and the following message
appears:

   Setup has detected an existing version of a SMS Primary Site Server. The
   version of the existing installation is 786.

   Since you are running Setup from your local program group, you cannot install
   a Site Server or Administrator UI, upgrade the site or add new components.
   Run setup from the SMS CD to perform these operations.

CAUSE
=====

The name of the directory that the Systems Management Server Service Pack setup
starts with the letters "SMS".

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, rename the directory that contains the Systems
Management Server Service Pack so that the first three characters are not "SMS".
For example, you could rename "SMSSP3" to "SP3SMS".
