TITLE   :Disk Counters on Clustered Disk Record Zero Values
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Cluster Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Performance Monitor to record activity on a shared clustered drive
in a Microsoft Cluster Server, the Physical and Logical Disk counters may record
zero or incorrect values. Even after enabling Diskperf -Y and restarting the
servers in the cluster, the first server to boot may properly record the disk
counters but if the shared drive is failed over to a second server, the disk
counters record zero and show no activity on the shared drive on the second
server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, you can initiate a failover to the shared disk and
then fail back again using the following steps:

1. Launch Cluster Administrator.

2. Right-click the group where the shared disk resides, and then click Move
   Group.

3. After the disk is online, repeat step 2 and move the group back again. This
   resets Performance Monitor and allows you to monitor disk activity.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
