-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft  version of this article, see Q194240.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you increase the size of text in FrontPage Editor by using the Increase
Text Size button on the Formatting toolbar, the font size is not reflected in
the Web browser.

CAUSE
=====

FrontPage nests as many levels of the increase font size tag (<BIG>) as
specified in FrontPage Editor; however, Netscape Navigator and Microsoft
Internet Explorer only use this tag when it is nested five times.
