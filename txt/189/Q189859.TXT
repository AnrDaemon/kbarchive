The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you convert a Microsoft Word 97 for Windows document, containing bulleted
or numbered lists, in WordPerfect 5.x format, the bullets and numbering
formatting is not retained. This behavior occurs if the first paragraph in your
document is not part of the bulleted or numbered list.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs because of an error in the WordPerfect 5.x converter that
ships with Word 97 for Windows.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can work around this problem by using either of the following methods.

Method 1: Save the File in WordPerfect 5.x Format
-------------------------------------------------

1. Click anywhere in the first paragraph, and then click the Bullets button on
   the Formatting toolbar. This will add a bullet to the first paragraph.

2. On the File menu, click Save As.

3. From the Save File As Type list, select WordPerfect 5.x for Windows, type a
   name for your file, and then click OK.

   NOTE: All of the numbers and bullets are converted to text or symbols, so
   there are no more "lists."

4. On the File menu, click Close.

5. On the File menu, click Open.

6. Select the document you just saved, and click Open.

7. Select the bullet and then press DELETE.

8. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to save the document again.

Method 2: Save the File in Another Format
-----------------------------------------

Save the file in another format, such as Rich Text Format (RTF).

STATUS
======
