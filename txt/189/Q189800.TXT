TITLE   :XCLN: IExpress Does Not Make Self-extracting Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:98
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 98 Deployment Kit 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Internet Explorer Administration Kit 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using Microsoft Internet Express to make a self-extracting file, you may
get the following error:

   Unable to find C:\Program Files\ODK\Tools\wextract.exe. Please make sure
   it is in the path or in the same folder as IExpress.exe.

CAUSE
=====

The Wextract.exe file is either missing or is in the wrong folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

Locate the Wextract.exe file and put it in the following folder:

   C:\Program Files\ODK\Tools

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Explorer
Administration Kit that ships with the Microsoft Outlook Deployment Kit.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Wextract.exe is needed by IExpress.exe to make the cab file self-
extracting. If it is not in the C:\Program Files\ODK\tools folder with
Express.exe, the cab files will still be created, but the error message will
appear at the end of the build process.

Locate the Wextract.exe file in the following folder:

   C:\Program Files\ODK\olbin\en\optional

When the Wextract.exe file has been located, copy it to the following folder:

   C:\Program Files\ODK\Tools

This will ensure that it is included in the cab files and Internet Express will
build the self extracting files without error.
