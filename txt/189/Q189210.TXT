SUMMARY
=======

Page xxxvii states that the companion CD-ROM contains a \Samples folder with
sample files used in the book. However, the CD-ROM may not contain a \Samples
folder. The first and second printings of "Running Microsoft Office 97, Updated
Edition" did not include this \Samples folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================
