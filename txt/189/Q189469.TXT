KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Cluster Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Cluster Administrator can connect to both Node A or Node B, as well as the
virtual cluster name. This can be beneficial in some instances when the RPC
service stops responding (hangs) in some manner because of errors relying on
dependencies that do not exist, or are in some way not functioning.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It can be beneficial as well to use the command-line switches that are built
into Cluster.exe. These switches are detailed in the "Appendix" section of the
documentation that is included with Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition,
version 4.0 on the first CD-ROM in the Support\Books\Mscsadma.doc file.
