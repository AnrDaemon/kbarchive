TITLE   :BUG: Painting Model for BitBlt and StretchBlt Changed for VB6
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A program that paints correctly using the BitBlt or StretchBlt API functions
under Visual Basic 5.0 might no longer work under Visual Basic 6.0. Under Visual
Basic 5.0, the bitmap is correctly displayed no matter whether the AutoRedraw
property of the Form is set to True or False. However, under Visual Basic 6.0,
if the AutoRedraw property is set to True, nothing is displayed and no error
messages are generated.

RESOLUTION
==========

In Visual Basic 6.0, set the Form's AutoRedraw property to False or call Refresh
to view the result after calling BitBlt or StretchBlt if the AutoRedraw property
is set to True.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Change the AutoRedraw property of Form1 to True.

3. Add a CommandButton (Command1) to Form1.

4. Add a PictureBox (Picture1) to Form1 and set its Picture property to a .bmp
   file.

5. Copy and paste the code below in Form1's code module:

         Option Explicit

         Private Declare Function BitBlt Lib "gdi32" ( _
            ByVal hDestDC As Long, ByVal x As Long, ByVal y As Long, _
            ByVal nWidth As Long, ByVal nHeight As Long, _
            ByVal hSrcDC As Long, ByVal xSrc As Long, ByVal ySrc As Long, _
            ByVal dwRop As Long) As Long

         Private Sub Command1_Click()

            Call BitBlt(hdc, ScaleX(Width, vbTwips, vbPixels) * 0.5, _
               ScaleY(Height, vbTwips, vbPixels) * 0.5, _
               ScaleX(Picture1.Width, vbTwips, vbPixels), _
               ScaleY(Picture1.Height, vbTwips, vbPixels), _
               Picture1.hdc, 0, 0, vbSrcCopy)
            '**************************************************************
            'Refresh    'this line is required for Visual Basic 6.0 to
                        'work if Form1.AutoRedraw is TRUE
            '**************************************************************
         End Sub

   If the above project is run in Visual Basic 5.0, everything behaves as
   expected. If run under Visual Basic 6.0, the program will not run as
   expected. For the above code to work in Visual Basic 6.0, you must call
   Refresh (as commented above).
