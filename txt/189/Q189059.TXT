SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using Microtest DiskPort CD-ROM changer software to operate a CD- ROM
tower, you may intermittently receive System Stop messages:

   0x0000000A ( 0xE11B1FB0, 0x00000002, 0x00000001, 0x80003D4A )
   IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL

NOTE: The parameters may vary depending on the hardware configuration.

CAUSE
=====

The CD-ROM driver Mtdpfltr.sys may not be written to function properly on
multiprocessor computers.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, you can try using the /numproc=1 switch in the
boot.ini file and see if the server runs without problems; otherwise, removing
the Microtest product is required.
