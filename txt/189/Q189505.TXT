KEYWORDS:kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp500bug kbvfp600fix kbXBase kbGrpDSFox

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use code in the Init event of a form to multi-select items in a list
box, the items are not correctly selected.

This behavior does not occur in Visual FoxPro version 3.0x.

CAUSE
=====

This is a timing problem in Visual FoxPro 5.x.

RESOLUTION
==========

To obtain the proper behavior, you can use a Timer object to control the code
that you multi-select.

Steps to Use a Timer Object
---------------------------

1. Create a form with a list box object and name the list box List1.

2. In the Init event of the form , add the following code:

   THIS.Timer1.ENABLED = .T.

3. Add a Timer control to the form and name it Timer1. Set the Interval property
   to 50.

4. Add the following code to the Timer event of Timer1:

   THISFORM.List1.ADDITEM("Red")
         THISFORM.List1.ADDITEM("Green")
         THISFORM.List1.ADDITEM("Blue")
         THISFORM.List1.MULTISELECT = .T.
         THISFORM.List1.SELECTED(2) = .T.
         THISFORM.List1.SELECTED( 3 ) = .T.
         THIS.INTERVAL = 0
         THIS.ENABLED = .F.

5. Run the form and note that both the second and third items are properly
   selected.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form with a list box object and name the list box List1.

2. In the Init event of the form add the following code:

   THIS.list1.ADDITEM('red')
         THIS.list1.ADDITEM('green')
         THIS.list1.ADDITEM('blue')
         THIS.list1.MULTISELECT=.T.
         THIS.list1.SELECTED(2)=.T.
         THIS.list1.SELECTED(3)=.T.

3. Close and then run the form. Note that the third item has a dotted line
   around it and the second item is not selected when both items should be
   selected.
