The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the limitations of the FileSystemObject stored in the
Microsoft Scripting Runtime file, scrrun.dll. For more information about the
FileSystemObject, see the appropriate topics in the Visual Basic documentation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

 - Reads only ASCII data - while the FileSystemObject can create an ASCII or
   Unicode text file, the FileSystemObject can only read ASCII text files.

 - Forward reading line-by-line - the FileSystemObject reads a text file in one
   direction: from the beginning to the end of the text file. Further, the
   FileSystemObject only reads line-by-line. If you need to go back to a
   previous line, then you must return to the beginning of the file and read
   forward to the required line.

 - Cannot open a file for simultaneous reading and writing - you can open a file
   for reading by using the ForReading IOMode parameter of the OpenTextFile
   method. However, if you want to modify the file, you must reopen the file for
   appending or writing and then open a textstream object to make your file
   modifications.

 - Cannot search for file names using wildcards - the FileSystemObject can only
   retrieve a specified file using the GetFile method. You cannot use wildcard
   characters in the filespec parameter of the GetFile method.

 - Cannot return the file version number - the File object in the Files
   collection of the FileSystemObject can return several file properties.
   However, there is no version property. Use the GetFileVersionInfo Windows API
   function to get a file's version information.

 - Cannot sort file names from the files collection - you can iterate through
   the File objects in the Files collection to obtain a list of the files in a
   folder. However, the File objects are not sorted. You need to use a sort
   routine to sort the File objects in the Files collection.
