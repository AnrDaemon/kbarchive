TITLE   :XADM: BCC Recipients Are Visible in an Embedded Message

KEYWORDS:exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook, Exchange Server Edition, version 8.0, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Outlook for Macintosh, Exchange Server Edition, version 8.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a recipient of message that has been sent as a BCC to other recipients
embeds this message in another message, the BCC recipients become visible in the
embedded message. This only occurs with the Windows 3.x or Macintosh clients.
32-bit Windows clients do not display this behavior.

CAUSE
=====

Attachments (including embedded messages) do not have the delivered flag set
during a CopyTo operation. Because BCC display is based on whether the message
has been delivered, this causes the BCC recipients to be shown at all times.
Outlook 32-bit Windows clients are using a fast transfer mechanism that strips
off the BCCs during the copy (instead of a CopyTo as the Windows 3.x and
Macintosh clients are using). This explains the discrepancy between the client
behaviors.

RESOLUTION
==========

For Exchange Server version 5.5: To resolve this problem, obtain the latest
service pack for Exchange Server version 5.5. For additional information, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION

During the message Config, the delivered flag is set according to the message
flags. During a CopyTo, if the destination is an embedded message, the delivered
flag is based off of the source item.
