SUMMARY
=======

The following list outlines which services are required, as well as those that
are NOT required, and those that MAY be required, to run Internet Information
Server (IIS) version 4.0 on a secure server. Your particular network or system
configuration can change some of the parameters. For example, some intranets
require WINS and DHCP.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The more services running on a computer, the more entry points there may be
available to malicious attack. A service is a potential entry point because it
processes client requests. To help reduce this risk, you should disable
unnecessary system services.

the Internet Information Server 4.0 Resource Kit.
