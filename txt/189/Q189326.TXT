SUMMARY
=======

Follow the steps below to ensure that you have proper IMAP4 connectivity to a
mailbox located on Microsoft Exchange.

NOTE: Press ENTER after you type each line:

Start a Telnet session using the following command:

1. Telnet <IP address of Mail server (Exchange)> 143

   If this works, you see the following response from the server:

   +OK Microsoft Exchange IMAP4rev1 server version x.x.x (F.Q.D.N.) ready

2. ? LOGIN <NTDOMAIN/NTACCOUNT/ALIAS> <PASSWORD>

   This begins the communication by initiating a login to the mailbox. Do not
   forget the "?" and space before the commands.

   You will receive this response:

   +OK LOGIN completed

3. ? LIST "" "*"

   This will provide a list of available folders.

4. ? Select <Folder> (for example, Inbox or Deleted Items)

   This selects the appropriate mailbox.

   You will receive the following response (this varies, depending on the number
   of messages in the mailbox):

   * <#> EXISTS
   * <#> RECENT
   * FLAGS (\Seen \Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Draft)
   * OK [PERMANENTFLAGS (\Seen \Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Draft)]
   * OK [UNSEEN <#>] Is the first unseen message
   * OK [UIDVALIDITY 73] UIDVALIDITY value.
   ? OK [READ-WRITE] SELECT completed.

5. ? FETCH <message number, [that is, 1, 2, 3, and so on]> <All,
   Body>

   This retrieves a message. You will see the message you selected with a
   "message number" response:

   * 1 FETCH (FLAGS ( )  INTERNALDATE "25-JUN-1998 10:57:38 -500"
   RFC822.SIZE 417 ENVELOPE 9"Thu, 25 Jun 1998 10:57:33 -500" "Test"
   (("Administrator" NIL "Administrator" "microsoft.com"))
   (("Administrator" NIL "Administrator" "microsoft.com"))
   (("Administrator" "microsoft".com")) NIL NIL NIL
   "219876E11AFBD111A43F00C04F8FECCA33D4@mail2.dns.microsoft.com"))
   * ? OK FETCH completed.

6. ? LOGOUT

This logs the user out of the IMAP session with the Exchange Server computer. You
will receive a message similar to this one when you are successful:

? LOGOUT
* BYE Microsoft Exchange IMAP4rev1 server version 5.5.2654.50 signing off
? OK LOGOUT completed.

NOTE: The version number may vary depending upon the Exchange Server Service Pack
installed. The example above is with Exchange Server version 5.4 SP4 applied.
If you can complete the above steps without error, any IMAP4 client conforming to
RFC 2060 should be able to connect to the mailbox on the Exchange Server
computer.
