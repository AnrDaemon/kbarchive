TITLE   :WD97: Word Fails to Open "Cannot Open the Existing <Square>"
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Case 1
------

When you attempt to start a second session of Microsoft Word 97 running on a
Windows NT, version 4.0, the following error message may appear:

   Word cannot open the existing <square symbol>

where <square symbol> is a symbol resembling an empty white box.

Case 2
------

When you attempt to open a password-protected document using the "read-only
recommended" option, the document fails to open.

CAUSE
=====

A variable limit was reached. Therefore, current disk free space appears to be
less than the amount required for creating an associated Temp file.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, obtain Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 2 (SR-2).


To temporarily work around this problem, use either of the following methods.

Method 1: Create a Paging File to Reduce the Amount of Perceived Disk Space
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the drive on which the Temp directory is located, create a paging file large
enough to create the impression of less free disk space [less than 2 gigabytes
(GB)].

Method 2: Use Only One Session of Word
--------------------------------------

Do not attempt to use two sessions of Word. Close the dialog box to the error
message and activate the open session of Word.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Office 97
Service Release 2 (SR-2). For additional information about SR-2, please see the
