TITLE   :CMPXCHG8B CPUs in Non-Intel/AMD x86 Compatibles Not Supported
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Computers with x86-based processors that report support for CMPXCHG8B in the
response from the CPUID instruction may cause the following blue-screen error
message during startup:

   STOP 0x0000003e
   MULTIPROCESSOR_CONFIGURATION_ NOT SUPPORTED

NOTE: This problem can occur on uniprocessor systems and only occurs on non-
Intel and non-AMD x86-based processors.

CAUSE
=====

During the boot process, Windows NT queries the processor for its type and uses
that information to adjust its initialization to take advantage of the features
that the processor should support. Later, it makes calls to the processor to
verify that it does support these specific features. One of the calls is to note
the maker of the processor. If the maker is not Intel or AMD, the return value
causes Windows NT to assume that the features are not supported by the
processor, even through they may be.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
