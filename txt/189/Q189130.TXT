TITLE   :BUG: VERSION(1) Function Returns Different Format in VFP 6
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual FoxPro 6.0 for Windows, the VERSION(1) function reports the format of
the FoxPro version number in a different format than earlier versions of the
product. The VERSION() function using the value of 1 as the optional argument (
VERSION(1) ), provides information on the Visual FoxPro version, date, time, and
serial number. The VERSION() function, with no argument returns the version
number only without the date, time, or serial number.

RESOLUTION
==========

The new format could pose problems in cases where legacy code parses the value
returned from the VERSION(1) function. If code needs to run on different
versions of Visual FoxPro, check the version number and parse the string
accordingly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Visual FoxPro versions 3.0x and 5.0x, the version number of the product
appears in the following format:

   99.99.99.9999

In Visual FoxPro 6.0, the version number appears in the following format:

   99.99.9999.99

The remainder of the string, which provides date, time, and product ID
information, remains the same.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

In Visual FoxPro 3.0x or 5.0x for Windows and Visual FoxPro 6.0 for Windows type
the following command:

      ?VERSION(1)

-or-

      ?VERSION()

Note the difference in the format of the Visual FoxPro version number between
versions 3.0x and 5.0x and Visual FoxPro 6.0.
