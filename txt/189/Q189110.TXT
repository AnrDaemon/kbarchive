TITLE   :PRB: "File Already Open" Error w/VSS DB on Unix Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe kbSSExplorer

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running under Windows NT, when you perform a checkin\checkout operation or
when you run Analyze.exe, on a database that resides in a UNIX computer, the
following error may occur:

   File <filepath> is already open.

CAUSE
=====

While mapping a network drive from a Windows NT computer to a UNIX computer
using HummingBird NFS Maestro software, you may have selected "Sharing" mode as
the default link.

RESOLUTION
==========

When mapping to Unix, choose only "Compat." mode as your default link.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can access a UNIX computer from a Windows computer using HummingBird NFS
Maestro software. This is accomplished by mapping a network drive using the NFS
Network Access (Hclnet.exe) utility found in the HummingBird install directory.
Under the Connect tab, you have the option to choose a combination of the three
following modes:

 - Sharing

 - Compatibility (Compat.)

 - CD-ROM

Sharing mode indicates that DOS-style sharing will be done over the network.
Thus, you can use this mode to connect Windows 95 computers and UNIX computers
without experiencing the problem described in the SYMPTOMS section.

Compatibility mode indicates that linking and sharing operations are directly
sent to rpc.lockd(the UNIX lock manager). Select CD-ROM mode when connecting to
a CD-ROM.

Before mapping a network drive from a Windows NT computer, make sure that you
select the "Compat. mode as the default link.
