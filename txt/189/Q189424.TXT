TITLE   :BUG: No Warning, Recordset Row Count Not Equal Length-specifier
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

No warning or error is issued when a method is invoked and the number of rows in
an input recordset does not agree with the length-specifier (count parameter).

For example, a method has two input parameters: a count parameter and a
recordset. The purpose of the count parameter is to indicate the number of rows
in the recordset. Although upon execution the actual number of rows in the
recordset does not equal the value of the count parameter, no error or warning
is issued.

This usage results from importing a COBOL table or group item that contains the
OCCURS DEPENDING ON clause. The OCCURS DEPENDING ON clause specifies another
variable, which is the length-specifier.

Using Component Builder, you can view the properties of the recordset input
parameter and click the Recordsets tab to see that the "Occurs depending on"
option is selected. The "Occurs depending on" option specifies the count
parameter mentioned above as the length-specifier of the OCCURS DEPENDING ON
clause in the imported COBOL.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in COM Transaction Integrator for
CICS and IMS version 1.00.
