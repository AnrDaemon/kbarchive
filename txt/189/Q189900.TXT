SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the HyperLink object to move to a FILE: URL, it does not cause any
errors, but it does not appear to do anything.

CAUSE

The API that is used by the HyperLink object does not support the Mailto: and
File: links.

RESOLUTION

Use the HyperLink foundation classes, such as the HyperLink Label or the
HyperLink button, found in the _hyperlink.vcx foundation class library. These
foundation classes support the FILE: links.

This behavior is by design.

      ox=CreateObject("hyperlink")
