a race condition in Winlogon wherein Secure Attention Sequence (SAS) messages
are disabled and not reenabled.

RESOLUTION

Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.


MORE INFORMATION
================

A race condition resulting in a computer that quits responding exists in
Winlogon if a custom Gina.dll's WlxLoggedOnSas function immediately returns with
