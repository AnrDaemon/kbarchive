event viewer if the Internet Mail Service Message Archival is set to maximum:

   Event ID: 4115
   Type: Error
   Source: MSExchangeIMC

   The message from the spool file <&%$#> seems to be looping through
   the routing extension for the Internet Mail Service. Please check that the
   routing DLL is configured properly.

   Type: Error

   Description:
