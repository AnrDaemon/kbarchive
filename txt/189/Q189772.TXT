TITLE   :FIX: GETPEM() Function Does Not Return the Correct ParentClass
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the GETPEM() function to return the value of the ParentClass property
of an instantiated class, you might get incorrect results. The return value
might be the ParentClass from another class in the class hierarchy, or might be
empty when it should have a value.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You use the GETPEM() function to return values of properties, or code from
events/methods of any classes or objects in memory. The GETPEM() function
requires two parameters. First, you pass it an object reference or the name of a
class. Second, you pass it a property, event, or method name.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code from a program (.prg) file:

         CLEAR
         CLEAR ALL
         oMe = CREATEOBJECT( "Son" )
         cClass = oMe.CLASS

         DO WHILE NOT(EMPTY(cClass))
            ?cClass + ' was begotten by ' + GETPEM(cClass, "ParentClass")
            cClass = GETPEM(cClass, "ParentClass")
         ENDDO

         DEFINE CLASS granddad AS CUSTOM
         ENDDEFINE

         DEFINE CLASS Dad AS granddad
         ENDDEFINE

         DEFINE CLASS Son AS Dad
         ENDDEFINE

RESULT: If you run the code under Visual FoxPro 5.0x, the program returns the
following to the desktop:

   Son was begotten by Granddad
   Granddad was begotten by

This is incorrect. The correct return values are:

   Son was begotten by Dad
   Dad was begotten by Granddad
   Granddad was begotten by Custom
   Custom was begotten by
