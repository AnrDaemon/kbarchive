SUMMARY
=======

ODBC connection pooling is enabled by default for ODBC drivers installed with
Microsoft Option Pack 4.0. In Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0 this setting
is handled on a driver-by-driver basis. This article describes how to enable or
disable this setting for any given ODBC driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

ODBC connection pooling is configured through a registry setting saved with the
ODBC driver information. This can be found in the Windows registry at the
following location:

   \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ODBC\ODBCINST.INI\<drivername>

Where <drivername> is the name of the ODBC driver in question. Connection
pooling is configured by setting the STRING value CPTIMEOUT to a non-zero value.
This value is the number of seconds a connection is held in the pool before
being discarded. Setting CPTIMEOUT to 0 disables connection pooling. If the
CPTIMEOUT value does not exist, connection pooling will be disabled for that
driver.
