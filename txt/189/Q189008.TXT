following error message:

   Bad IP Address <hostname>

However, you can still ping hosts by IP address.

Additionally the SBS server also may not be able to successfully connect to FTP,
HTTP, Telnet resources on the Internet.

steps:

1. Click Start, point at Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the WSP Client icon.

3. Click to clear the Enable the WinSock Proxy Client check box.

4. Close the configuration screen and restart the computer.

MORE INFORMATION

Small Business Server. If you are not using the Proxy server, you should disable
this feature.
