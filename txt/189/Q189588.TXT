TITLE   :SMS: SQL Transfer Manager Errors When Moving SMS Database
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDatabase smsdatabase

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sp_site.sql is the script that the Systems Management Server Setup program runs
to create the sp_GetSubSites and sp_GetSubGroupSites stored procedures. Manually
running this script creates the appropriate temporary tables, and also drops and
re-creates the necessary Systems Management Server stored procedures.

SYMPTOMS
========

When using SQL Transfer Manager to move the SMS database from one SQL Server to
another, it is possible to encounter errors similar to the following:

   ::Error::
   In file DATABASE.SMS.PRC in statement on line 1
   Transfer Status: Creating Stored Procedures on destination database
   Invalid object name '#Sites'.

   ::Error::
   In file DATABASE.SMS.PRC in statement on line 1
   Transfer Status: Creating Stored Procedures on destination database
   Invalid object name '#Sites'.

   ::Error::
   In file DATABASE.SMS.PRC in statement on line 105
   Transfer Status: Creating Stored Procedures on destination database
   Invalid object name 'dbo.sp_GetSubGroupSites'.

   ::Error::
   In file DATABASE.SMS.PRC in statement on line 108
   Transfer Status: Creating Stored Procedures on destination database
   Invalid object name '#Sites'.

   ::Error::
   In file DATABASE.SMS.PRC in statement on line 108
   Transfer Status: Creating Stored Procedures on destination database
   Invalid object name '#Sites'.

   ::Error::
   In file DATABASE.SMS.PRC in statement on line 108
   Transfer Status: Creating Stored Procedures on destination database
   Invalid object name '#Sites'.

   ::Error::
   In file DATABASE.SMS.PRC in statement on line 160
   Transfer Status: Creating Stored Procedures on destination database
   Invalid object name 'dbo.sp_GetSubSites'.

CAUSE
=====

These errors indicate a problem with creating the SMS stored procedures. This
can happen if the required temporary tables are not present.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem and re-create these procedures manually on the
destination server, perform the following steps:

1. Start SQL Enterprise Manager.

2. On the Tools menu, click SQL Query Tool.

3. Select the SMS database.

4. click the Load SQL Script toolbar button.

5. Navigate to the Sms\Site.srv\<Platform>.bin\Sp_site.sql file.

6. Click the Execute Query toolbar button.
