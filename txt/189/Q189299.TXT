TITLE   :SMS: Windows 95 Client Reports BIOS Manufacturer Name as Unknown
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Systems Management Server inventories a Windows 95 system, the BIOS
manufacturer is usually reported. On some client computers, Systems Management
Server reports the BIOS manufacturer as Unknown. Windows 95 will also report the
BIOS manufacturer as Unknown, yet may be able to report the BIOS version number.

CAUSE
=====

The Systems Management Server inventory agent (INVDOS) uses standard BIOS calls
that are also used by Windows 95 and Microsoft Diagnostics (MSD) to obtain BIOS
information. If Windows 95 or MSD is unable to report the BIOS manufacturer,
Systems Management Server may also report Unknown for all BIOS fields, including
the BIOS version number.

WORKAROUND
==========

To collect the information, you can distribute a custom MIF, to be filled out
manually by the end user.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
