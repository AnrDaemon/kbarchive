TITLE   :XCON: MTA Logs Event 9301 Though X.400 Connector Is Identified
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Events similar to the following are seen in the Application Event log:

   Event ID: 9301
   Source: MSExchangeMTA
   Type: Information
   Category: Configuration
   Description:
   "The message transfer gateway that uses the network address xxxxxxxx and
   the transport stack
   /o=EXORG/ou=EXSITE/cn=Configuration/cn=Servers/cn=EXSERVER/cn=TCP
   (EXSERVER) could not be found. Check the configuration of the mail
   gateway.
   [BASE IL TCP/IP DRVR 8 218] (10)"

There is no problem in transferring messages over the connector.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs on a message transfer agent (MTA) that receives a connection request
over an X.400 Connector using a TCP/IP Stack. The connection request contains
the IP address of the remote MTA. The local MTA tries to find the corresponding
X.400 Connector in its configuration by comparing this address with the values
for address on the Stack Properties page of each connector. If it fails to find
the address (because, for example, the stack address is a computer name or a
fully qualified domain name), it logs the 9301 Event.

The MTA then attempts a reverse-lookup on the address (using DNS or a hosts file,
for example) and successfully matches this result with the name in the Stack
Properties Address field. The connection is then accepted and the message
transferred.

If the reverse lookup fails, the MTA logs a second 9301 event, and no message is
transferred. In this case, you can either configure the X.400 Connector with the
IP Address, or investigate the problem with reverse lookup.

RESOLUTION
==========

The event is informational and can be safely ignored. However, a fix to the MTA
now exists that logs only the second event; that is, if the connector cannot be
found and messages cannot be transferred.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the

STATUS

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
