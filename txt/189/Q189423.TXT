TITLE   :Memory Leak: Recordsets with OCCURS DEPENDING ON Clause
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

Using Windows NT Task Manager, you can see increments in memory utilization upon
repeated calls to a COMTI method. This memory leak occurs under the following
conditions:

1. The series of calls uses the same Microsoft Transaction Server process.

2. The method invoked contains an input parameter that is a recordset. The
   recordset contains zero rows of data when the call is made. The actual number
   of rows contained by the recordset is indicated by another input parameter,
   the count parameter or length-specifier.

This usage results from importing a COBOL table or group item that contains the
OCCURS DEPENDING ON clause. The OCCURS DEPENDING ON clause specifies the count
parameter mentioned above.

Using Component Builder, you can view the properties of the recordset input
parameter and click the Recordsets tab to see that the "Occurs depending on"
option is selected and specifies the count parameter.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, initialize at least one row of data of the input
recordset. Regardless, the count parameter can be set to zero.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in COM Transaction Integrator for
CICS and IMS version 1.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S.
service pack for SNA Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
