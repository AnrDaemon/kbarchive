The information in this article applies to:

 - MSPRESS Running Microsoft Windows 98 ISBN 1-57231-681-0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Readme.txt file in the root directory of the CD-ROM states that to install
the Windows 98 Starts Here demo, you should run Autorun.exe from the Win98SH
folder.

However, if you run \Win98SH\Autorun.exe, My Computer will open and display the
root directory of the C drive. Nothing else will occur.

CAUSE
=====

The autorun.inf file contains errors that cause the Autorun.exe to function
incorrectly.

WORKAROUND
==========

From the Win98SH folder, open Start.htm. The demo will now proceed normally.

STATUS
======

This problem was corrected in the second printing of "Running Microsoft Windows
98."

MORE INFORMATION
================

The first printing of "Running Microsoft Windows 98" and the second and later
printings of "Running Microsoft Windows 98" include different demonstration
copies of "Microsoft Windows 98 Starts Here."

The second and later printings include a Setup.exe program in the Win98SH folder.
The first printing does not.

The information in this article applies to the first printing of "Running
Microsoft Windows 98" only. The second and later printings will have this
problem corrected.
