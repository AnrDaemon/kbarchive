TITLE   :FP: FrontPage Personal Web Server Not Designed for Dedicated Use
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,1.1,97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusagekbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q194229.

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to use the FrontPage Personal Web server for extended use, such
as a dedicated intranet Web server that you never reboot, the Web server may
leak system resources and eventually fail.

CAUSE
=====

The FrontPage Personal Web Server was designed not to be a dedicated Web server,
but rather to provide "proofing" functionality to Web authors who develop and
test Webs before publishing them to a production server. Because of this, it
does not have the same resource management capability that dedicated server
software provides.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you need to have a dedicated server, you should upgrade to the Microsoft
Personal Web server or Microsoft Internet Information Server.
