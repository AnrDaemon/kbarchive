======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Trying to run Visual Basic results in the following error message:

   Unexpected Error; Quitting

This error occurs after the Visual Basic splash screen appears.

CAUSE
=====

There are two known casues for this error:

1. Visual Basic cannot find one of the following two files needed to run:

   MSO97RT.DLL
   MRT7ENU.DLL

2. You are trying to run Visual Basic from a network "Administrator" setup.

RESOLUTION
==========

For the first situation, the two files listed in the "Cause" section can be
located on the Visual Basic installation CD in the \OS\System directory.

These two files need to be copied into one of the following directories in order
to resolve the issue:

   C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\VBA

   -or-

   C:\Program Files\Common Files\MsApps\VBA


For the second situation, install Visual Basic locally. The Visual Basic product
is not designed to run in a shared mode, so network Administrtator setups are
unsupported. Please see the "References" section for more information.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
