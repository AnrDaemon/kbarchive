TITLE   :PRB: UpDown Control May Not Increment As Expected
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the up or down button on an UpDown control, you notice that the
value changes by more than the amount specified for the Increment property. For
example, if the Increment property is 2, the value of the UpDown control may
change by 3 instead of 2.

CAUSE
=====

When you click the up or down button to change the value of an UpDown control,
the control will first "normalize" the current value before it is changed by the
amount specified in the Increment property. By normalizing the value, the UpDown
control may change by more than the amount specified in the Increment property
so that the new value is evenly divisible by the Increment.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Choose Components from the Project menu, check "Microsoft Windows Common
   Controls-2" and click OK. The UpDown control should now be available on the
   Toolbox.

3. Add a Textbox control to Form1.

4. Add an UpDown control to Form1.

5. Set the properties of the UpDown1 control as follows:

         BuddyControl = Text1
         BuddyProperty = Text
         Increment = 2
         Max = 13
         Min = 3
         Value = 3

6. Add the following code to the Form1 module:

         Option Explicit

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            Text1.Text = UpDown1.Min
         End Sub

7. Run the project. Form1 appears.

8. Click once on the up arrow of the UpDown control. Although the Increment
   property is 2, the value of the UpDown control changes from 3 to 6 rather
   than 3 to 5.
