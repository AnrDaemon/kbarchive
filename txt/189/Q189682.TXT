SUMMARY
=======

When binding a DataList or a DataCombo control to an ADO recordset at run time,
follow the steps below:

      DataCombo1.DataField = "DestinationBoundField"
      DataCombo1.BoundColumn = "SourceBoundField"
      DataCombo1.ListField = "SourceDisplayField"
      Set DataCombo1.RowSource = rsSourceRecordset
      Set DataCombo1.DataSource = rsDestinationRecordset

For example, you may want to maintain an EmployeeID field in an Orders table;
however, you would want to allow the user to select the appropriate employee
information by the employee's name, rather than by the EmployeeID field.

In this case, the destination for the selection from the combo box is the
EmployeeID field in the Orders recordset. But the source for this information is
the recordset containing information from the Employees table.

The ListField property should be set to the field whose information you want to
display; while the BoundColumn property should be set to the field whose
information you want to bind to the destination recordset. In this case, the
ListField would be EmployeeName and the BoundColumn would be EmployeeID.
