TITLE   :XCON: MTA 9277 RPC Cancel Call for Thread
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0, 5.0, 5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A large number (up to hundreds) of Event IDs: 9277 appear in the application
event log, similar to the following:

   9277: MSExchangeMTA
   The MTA has issued an RPC Cancel call for thread 22, Locality Table
   Index:
   142, Time (ms): 1804070, Cancel result: 0 [TRUMAN RPC inactive
   ncacn_ip_tcp:192.168.20.3[1966] BASE IL] (14)

CAUSE
=====

The message transfer agent (MTA) makes remote procedure calls (RPCs) to other
MTAs in the normal course of operation. When the MTA has made a call to another
computer and does not receive a response within two minutes, it cancels the RPC.
This is normal. A massive number of these RPC cancels indicates any of several
possible problems, such as the following:

 - network problems

 - heavy network traffic

 - network latency issues (not uncommon with frame relay networks with guaranty
   bandwidths of less than 128 kilobits per second)

 - problems with the remote computer

 - router problems (or router changes, including filtering or other software
   running on the routers that analyzes and filters or alters network packets)

 - protocol stack problems

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, verify basic connectivity between the Exchange
Server computers, or fix the network issues.
