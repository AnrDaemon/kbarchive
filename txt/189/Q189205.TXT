Contents:

 - Book Covers FrontPage 97, not FrontPage 98

MORE INFORMATION
================

Book Covers FrontPage 97, Not FrontPage 98
------------------------------------------

Chapter 20, "Creating a Web site with FrontPage", covers Microsoft FrontPage 97.
The same is true of the other references to Microsoft FrontPage in the book.
However, Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server version 4.0a includes
Microsoft FrontPage 98.

"Running Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server" was originally written using
version 4.0, which included FrontPage 97. While the authors tried to include as
many features of 4.0a as possible in the book, time constraints prevented them
from rewriting the section on Microsoft FrontPage for FrontPage 98. This problem
will be corrected in future editions of the book.


Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of the book, it may already
contain the above corrections.
