======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 
 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes differences in functionality that are a part of eMbedded
Visual Basic and the Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic (VBCE) and do not
appear in regular Visual Basic.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Control Differences
-------------------

The controls used in eVB and VBCE are not the same as those used in regular
Visual Basic and are not interchangeable. They are specifically designed for the
Windows CE operating system.

 - The ScrollBar control is a combination of the horizontal and vertical
   scrollbars in regular Visual Basic. Properties are used to specify horizontal
   or vertical orientation.

 - The File System Control contains two classes: File and FileSystem. The File
   object allows for file creation, input, and output. The FileSystem object
   allows for file and directory management.

 - The Financial Control (Finance.DLL) replaces the financial functions that are
   intrinsic to regular Visual Basic. All of the financial functions available
   in regular Visual Basic are provided as methods of the Financial object.

Function Differences
--------------------

 - Formatting functions. Instead of the generic Format() function, eVB and VBCE
   provide dedicated formatting functions for specific data: FormatCurrency(),
   FormatDateTime(), FormatNumber(), and FormatPercent().

 - String functions. Several very useful new string manipulation functions are
   included for use in Windows CE:

    - Filter() - returns a zero-based array containing a subset of a string
      array based on a specified filter criteria.

    - InStrRev() - provides similar information about strings as InStr, but it
      provides the position from the right. The standard InStr() is also
      available.

    - Join() - returns a string created by joining a number of substrings
      contained in an array.

    - Split() - returns a zero-based, one-dimensional array containing a
      specified number of substrings.

    - StrReverse() - returns a string in which the character order of a
      specified string is reversed.

 - Round() returns a number rounded to a specified number of decimal places.

 - WeekDayName() returns a string indicating the specified day of the week.

Miscellaneous
-------------

 - The App object has an End method. It has the same functionality as (and is
   used within eVB and VBCE in lieu of) the End statement in regular Visual
   Basic.

 - The PointSet method replaces PSet to set the color of a specified point on a
   Form. PointSet does not support the Step optional parameter of PSet.

 - The SetScale method replaces Scale to define the coordinate system for a
   Form.

 - Because eVB and VBCE rely heavily on the VBScript Engine, there are several
   functions that provide useful information about the engine:

    - ScriptEngine() - function returns a string representing the scripting
      language in use.

    - ScriptEngineBuildVersion() - function returns the build version number of
      the script engine in use.

    - ScriptEngineMajorVersion() - function returns the major version number of
      the script engine in use.

    - ScriptEngineMinorVersion() - function returns the minor version number of
      the script engine in use.
