======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The AppWizard, included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a Custom AppWizard that uses the Standard AppWizard step defined by
the APWZDLG_DLGAPPOPTIONS dialog box (Step 2), the macro values associated with
this dialog box do not get set when the Next button is clicked.

RESOLUTION
==========

The macro values are set when the Next button or the Back button of the
APWZDLG_PROJOPTIONS dialog is clicked (Step 3). The TITLE macro is an exception.
This macro is not set until the Finish button is selected.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The APWZDLG_DLGAPPOPTIONS dialog has the following associated macros:

   ABOUT        Whether the standard MFC AppWizard user or Custom AppWizard
                user has specified that the dialog-based application
                include an About box. Default value is ON.

   HELP         Whether the standard MFC AppWizard user or custom AppWizard
                user has specified that the application have
                context-sensitive help. Default value is OFF.

   3D           Whether the standard MFC AppWizard user or custom AppWizard
                user has specified that the application use 3D controls.
                Default value is ON.

   AUTOMATION   Whether the standard MFC AppWizard user or custom AppWizard
                user has selected Automation support. Default value is OFF.

   OLECTL       Whether the application supports using ActiveX Controls.
                Default value is ON.

   SOCKETS      Whether the standard MFC AppWizard user or custom AppWizard
                user has specified that the project have Windows Sockets
                support. Default value is OFF.

   TITLE        The caption string for an application's main title bar or,
                in a dialog-based application, the dialog's title. Default
                value is the name of the project.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Custom AppWizard based on Standard MFC AppWizard steps.

2. In your Custom AppWizard's CDialogChooser::Next and CDialogChooser::Back
   functions, add the following code:

         // Look up the value associated with the ABOUT macro.
         // Replace <MyCustomAWProj> with your custom AppWizard project name.
         // See "CCustomAppWiz::m_Dictionary" in the on-line documentation.
         CString strAbout;
         if( !<MyCustomAWProj>aw.m_Dictionary.Lookup(_T("ABOUT"), strAbout) )
            strAbout = "ABOUT is not defined in the dictionary";
         else
            strAbout = "ABOUT is " + strAbout;
         AfxMessageBox( strAbout );

3. Build your Custom AppWizard by selecting Build from the main menu or by
   entering F7.

4. Create a new project based on a Custom AppWizard.

5. In Step 1, select "Dialog based" as the type of application to create, and
   click the Next button. The message box will show that the ABOUT macro is set.

6. In Step 2, clear the About Box check box, and click the Next button. The
   message box still shows the ABOUT macro is set.

7. In Step 3, click the Next button or the Back button. The message box now
   shows that the ABOUT macro is undefined.

This behavior is the same for the macros in the MORE INFORMATION section of this
article with the exception of TITLE. This macro is not defined until the Finish
button is clicked.
