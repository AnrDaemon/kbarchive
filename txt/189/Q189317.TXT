The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Monster Truck Madness 2, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install Monster Truck Madness 2 on a computer running
Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0, you may receive the following
error message:

   An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
   generated.

   EBUxx.exe
   Exception: access violation (0xc0000005)

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if your computer is configured to use more than one
processor.

The Monster Truck Madness 2 Setup program creates a temporary program named

computers configured to use multiple processors.

RESOLUTION

processor. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Start the Monster Truck Madness 2 Setup program.

2. When the opening Setup screen is displayed, press CTRL+ALT+DELETE.

3. Click Task Manager.

4. Click the Processes tab.

5. Right-click the Ebuxx.exe process, and then click Set Affinity.

6. Click each CPU check box to clear it, with the exception of CPU 0, and then
   click OK.

7. On the File menu, click Exit Task Manager.

8. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation of Monster
   Truck Madness 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Ebuxx.exe program is deleted when Monster Truck Madness 2 Setup is finished.
