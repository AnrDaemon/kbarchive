SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a WinSock application on a Windows NT computer, one or more of the
following symptoms may occur:

 - If a WinSock 1.1 application sets the SO_OPENTYPE sockopt, or a WinSock 2.0
   application does not specify WSA_FLAG_OVERLAPPED to WSASocket(), the socket
   handle returned by WSPSocket() is supposed to be non-overlapped, and usable
   by ReadFile/Writefile etc. If a layered service provider (LSP) is installed,
   the non-overlapped flag is ignored and all sockets created are overlapped.
   This causes any application that uses file I/O calls to hang or fail.

 - When sending a 4 KB packet over NetBEUI followed by a receive packet, the 4
   KB send returns success, but does not make it to the remote end and the
   subsequent receive fails with c000013b or error code 1726
   (RPC_S_CALL_FAILED). This happens with or without security, and only with
   buffers greater than or equal to 4 KB.

 - When running a script with the WinSock function AfdAllocateMdlChain, when
   WSASend bufferPointer is set to NULL and/or bufferLength is set to zero (0),
   WSARecv and WSARecvFrom return SUCCESS but report that they transferred zero
   bytes even though there is data available to be received. This call should
   not succeed with the amount of data available to be transferred. WSASend and
   WSASendTo return WSAEFAULT, which is correct behavior.

RESOLUTION
==========
