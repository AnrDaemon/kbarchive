TITLE   :DocErr: Perfmon Command Line Options Are Incorrect in Reskit
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Chapter 10 of the Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Resource Kit, on page 296, in
the "Starting and Setting up Performance Monitor" section, it states:

   You can also specify a computer name in addition to, or instead of, a
   settings file. For example:

   C:\> perfmon \\paris1

   -Or-

   C:\> perfmon settings.pmw \\issaquah

The above syntax is incorrect.

CAUSE
=====

To specify a computer name from a command line, a -c switch must precede the
\\<computer name>. Furthermore, the -c switch negates the other command
option that specifies a settings file. Therefore, you cannot specify both a
computer name and a settings file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Windows NT Workstation 4.0
Resource Kit.
