SYMPTOMS
========

When starting the Browser Service, your computer may appear to stop responding
(hang) and the following error message may occur:

   Could not start the Computer Browser Service on \\SERVERNAME.
   Error 2186: The service is not responding to the control function.

When you attempt to stop the Browser Service using the Services utility in
Control Panel, the Stop button may be unavailable.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a race condition in the startup code in the browser.
The Browser service has two tasks trying to report status to the Service Control
Manager. The result is that the status of the Browser service gets set to an
incorrect value.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
