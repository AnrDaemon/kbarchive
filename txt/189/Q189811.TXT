TITLE   :FP: Cannot Import File After Parse Error
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:1.0; WINDOWS:1.0,1.1,97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbconversionkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When importing a file that contains corrupted data into a Web, you may receive a
parse error and FrontPage does not import the file into the Web. These symptoms
appear even after you attempt to fix the file.

NOTE: A file that contains corrupted data may be a corrupted HyperText Markup
Language (HTML) file or an Internet Database Connector (IDC) or HyperText Markup
Language Extension (HTX) file that is in an incorrect format.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the configuration file that FrontPage uses to verify
content has already been created in the _vti_cnf folder even though you have not
imported the file. Because the configuration file now contains an error,
FrontPage cannot import the corrected file until the damaged file is removed
from the Web.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the damaged file and then import the file after you have fixed it. To do
this, follow these steps:

1. Double-click My Computer.

2. Open the folder that contains the Web root.

   The default folder varies depending on the type of server you have installed.
   You can use the following table as a guide in locating your folder:

      Server                                 Default Folder
      ------------------------------------------------------------------

      FrontPage Personal Web Server          \FrontPage Webs\Content
      Microsoft Personal Web Server
        for Windows 95                       \Webshare\Wwwroot
      Microsoft Internet Information
        Server for Windows NT Server         \Inetpub\Wwwroot
      Peer Web Services for Windows NT
        Workstation                          \Inetpub\Wwwroot

3. Open the folder that contains your Web.

4. Open the _vti_cnf folder.

5. Delete the file that you cannot import.

6. Switch to FrontPage and reimport the file.

STATUS
======
