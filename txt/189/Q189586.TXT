TITLE   :XFOR: Dial-up Internet Mail Service Fails with Event 4106
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you set up a dial-up Internet Mail Service connector, the following stop
events randomly appear in the application event log:

   MSExchangeIMC Error SMTP Interface Events 4106 The Dial-up connection 'Phone
   book entry' could not be made. The error reported was: [317] (317)

   -OR-

   MSExchangeIMC Error SMTP Interface Events 4106 The dial-up connection 'Phone
   book entry' could not be made. The error reported was: [4264763456]
   (4264763456)

When this event occurs, the modem fails to dial. The modem eventually recovers
and successfully dials. This event can cause the Internet Mail Service connector
to miss its scheduled dial-up session.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For
