TITLE   :BUG: DateTimePicker Overrides ALT+F4 Key Combination
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a DateTimePicker (DTPicker) control has focus, the ALT+F4 key combination
does not work. If focus is moved to another control such as a TextBox, the
ALT+F4 keystroke behaves normally.

RESOLUTION
==========

Utilizing either the KeyDown or KeyUp event of the DTPicker control, you can
manually watch for the ALT+F4 keystroke combination and take the appropriate
action, such as closing the application.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Choose Components from the Project menu and add a reference to "Microsoft
   Windows Common Controls-2".

3. Add a DTPicker control to Form1.

4. Add a TextBox Control to Form1.

5. Run the sample application.

6. Put focus on the DTPicker control if it doesn't have focus already.

7. Press the ALT+F4 keys. Note that the form does not close.

8. Move focus to the TextBox.

9. Press the ALT+F4 keys. The form closes as expected.

10. To workaround this behavior, paste the following code into Form1's code
   window:

          Private Sub DTPicker1_KeyDown(KeyCode As Integer, Shift As Integer)
             ' Check for Alt and F4 keystrokes
             If (Shift And vbAltMask) And (KeyCode = vbKeyF4) Then
                ' Unload the application
                Unload Me
             End If
          End Sub

11. Repeat steps 5 - 7 and note that the form closes as expected.
