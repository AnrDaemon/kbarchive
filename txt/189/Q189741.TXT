When a project has two or more visible forms and a message box is displayed, one
or more forms fall to the background, possibly behind other forms. This behavior

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the ShowInTaskBar property to True or the BorderStyle property to
something other than 3-FixedDialog.

beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Steps To Reproduce
------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Add a new form (Form2) to the project.

3. In the Form1 Click event, place the following code:

         Private Sub Form1_Click()
            Form2.Show
         End Sub

4. In the Form2 Click event, place the following code.
