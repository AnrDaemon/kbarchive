======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You receive an "Access to the file... denied" error on WebClass files. Internet
Information Server (IIS) loads files and sometimes they are still loaded when
you try to write to these files from the Visual Basic IDE that will cause this
error to appear.

CAUSE
=====

IIS has the file cached so you receive the error message "Access to the file...
denied."

RESOLUTION
==========

To unload the DLL or other files that you were denied access to, stop Internet
Information Server. There are several ways to stop Internet Information Server:

 - In Visual Basic, while you are in the WebClass designer, select the toolbar
   item "Stop Internet Information Server".

 - In the Windows Control Panel, select Services and Stop the IIS Admin Service.

 - At a command prompt, type the following command:

   "net stop iisadmin /y" (without the quotation marks)

   On a Microsoft Windows 2000-based computer, type the following command:

   "iisreset" (without the quotation marks)

NOTE: Stopping the Web site from the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) does not
cause IIS to unload these files.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
