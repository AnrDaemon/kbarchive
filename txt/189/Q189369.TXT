SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to gain access to your CD-ROM drive at an MS-DOS
prompt so you can copy the Windows 95 Setup files from the CD-ROM drive to a
hard disk and then reinstall Windows 95. You may need to do this if:

 - You are unable to start Windows 95 in normal mode.

 - You do not have access to real-mode CD-ROM drivers.

 - Your CD-ROM drive was functional using protected-mode drivers before you
   became unable to start Windows 95 in normal mode.

 - You want to reinstall Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To gain access to your CD-ROM drive, copy the Windows 95 Setup files from this
CD-ROM drive to a hard disk, and then reinstall Windows 95, use the following
steps:

1. Restart the computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, press
   F8, and then choose Safe Mode Command Prompt Only on the Startup menu.

2. At the command prompt, type the following lines, pressing ENTER after each
   line:

   "cd windows
   edit system.ini" (without the quotation marks)

3. Locate the "shell=explorer" line in the [Boot] section of the System.ini
   file.

4. Change the line to read "shell=command.com" (without the quotation marks).

5. Press ALT+F, and then press S. Press ALT+F, and then press X.

6. Restart the computer.

   NOTE: After your computer restarts, it should operate in an MS-DOS virtual
   machine with access to the CD-ROM drive, but this may not work correctly. If
   you are unable to access the CD-ROM drive, you may need to enable the
   Mscdex.exe line in the Autoexec.bat file or you may need to install real-mode
   drivers. To enable the Mscdex.exe line, use any text editor (such as Edit) to
   open the Autoexec.bat file in the root folder of drive C. Look for a line
   containing "Mscdex.exe," and then remove the "REM" statement at the beginning
   of the line. Save the changes, quit the text editor, and then restart your
   computer. For information about how to install real-mode drivers for your
   CD-ROM drive, contact the manufacturer of your CD-ROM drive or computer, or
   view the documentation included with your CD-ROM drive or computer.

7. At the command prompt, type the following commands, pressing ENTER after each
   command:

   "md flat
   <CD-ROM drive letter>:
   cd win95
   copy *.* c:\flat" (without the quotation marks)

8. At the command prompt, type the following commands, pressing ENTER after each
   command:

   "c:
   cd windows
   edit system.ini" (without the quotation marks)

9. Locate the "shell=command.com" line in the [Boot] section of the System.ini
   file.

10. Change the line to read "shell=explorer.exe" (without the quotation marks).

11. Press ALT+F, and then press S. Press ALT+F, and then press X.

12. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE, and then click Shut Down.

13. Restart your computer, press the F8 key at the "Starting Windows 95"
   message, and then choose "Safe Mode Command Prompt Only".

14. At the command prompt, type the following commands, pressing ENTER after
   each command:

   "cd\
   cd flat
   setup" (without the quotation marks)

15. Follow the instructions on the screen to finish installing Windows 95.
