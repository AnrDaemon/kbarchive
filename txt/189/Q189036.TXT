TITLE   :PRB: WinDBG for WinCe 2.0 Does Not Support Named Pipes
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows CE, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This article applies to the WinDBG debugger for Windows CE, version 2.0. When
you use named pipes for a transport layer, the following error occurs:

   Transport DLL "TLPIPE.DLL" cannot connect to remote computer.

CAUSE
=====

WinDBG for Windows CE, version 2.0 does not support using named pipes for a
transport layer. WinDBG allows the user to change the transport layer to TLPIPE
even though it is not supported.

RESOLUTION
==========

Currently, the only way to perform remote debugging with WinDBG is to use a
Serial cable through the COM port.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
