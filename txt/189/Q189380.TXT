The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q194445.

SYMPTOMS
========

Text overwrites a right-aligned image if there are no spaces in the string of
text.

CAUSE
=====

FrontPage Editor and Web browsers wrap text only if a space appears between
words. Therefore, if you type a long string of text that contains no spaces, the
text will eventually overwrite the right-aligned image.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent your text from overwriting a right-aligned image, use either of the
following methods:

 - Add a space in the line of text to force it to break and wrap to the next
   line.

   -or-

 - Place the text and image in separate cells of a table. Because the text will
   not exceed the cell boundary, it will not overwrite the image.
