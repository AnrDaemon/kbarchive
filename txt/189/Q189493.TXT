TITLE   :RTF Translation to Notes Servers May Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Word as the e-mail editor and send mail to a Lotus Notes
server connected via the Exchange Notes Connector, it is possible that the
message will be unreadable to the Notes recipient. Sending the same mail to the
same user is fine if sent from an Exchange or Outlook client.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Notes Connector requires that a Notes client (version 4.5 or later)
be installed on the same server on which the Exchange Notes Connector is
installed. The reason is that the Notes client's files are used by the connector
to perform translations and other tasks involving communicating with the Notes
server. The Exchange Notes Connector itself does not translate a message; the
Notes client performs this translation. , Also, the Wordmail translation files
are not able to perform the appropriate translation into Notes' RTF format.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not use Microsoft Word as the e-mail editor when you send messages to Notes
users via the Notes Connector.
