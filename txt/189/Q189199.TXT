MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 52: Reflexive and Symmetric Used Incorrectly
-------------------------------------------------

The terms "Reflexive" and "Symmetric" are used incorrectly to describe
QueryInterface rules. The correct meaning of these terms is as follows:

   Reflexive: (A=A)
   Symmetric: (if A=B, then B=A)

To correct the book, the terms should be swapped. Specifically, page 52 should be
changed in the following ways:

   QueryInterface must be reflexive. If a client holds a pointer to an interface
   and queries for that same interface, the call must succeed. QueryInterface
   must be symmetric. If a client holding a pointer to one interface queries
   successfully for a second interface, the client must be able to call
   QueryInterface through the second pointer for the first interface.

Swap Reflexive and Symmetric labels on Figure 2-4.


Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
