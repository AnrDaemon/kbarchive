TITLE   :BUG: Data Written to Table Despite Textbox Returning False
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Visual FoxPro writes data to a table, even though a text box within a grid
returns false (.f.).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior also occurs when you use visual development tools instead of code
to create the form and grid.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a program that contains the following code:

         CREATE TABLE TestTable (Field1 c(1))
         APPEND BLANK

         PUBLIC oForm1
         oForm1 = CREAT('Form')
         oForm1.SHOW

         oForm1.ADDOBJECT('Grid1','GridClass')
         oForm1.Grid1.VISIBLE = .T.

         DEFINE CLASS GridClass AS GRID
            ADD OBJECT column1 AS ColumnClass
            RECORDSOURCE = 'TestTable'
            RECORDSOURCETYPE = 1
         ENDDEFINE

         DEFINE CLASS TextClass AS TEXTBOX
            PROC VALID
            RETURN .F.
         ENDDEFINE

         DEFINE CLASS ColumnClass AS COLUMN
            ADD OBJECT text1 AS TextClass
         ENDDEFINE

2. Run the program and type a letter in the text box of the first column of the
   grid. A wait window appears informing you of the invalid input. Clear the
   wait window and close the form. Another wait window appears when you close
   the form. Ignore it.

3. Type the following in the Command window:

   " BROWSE" (without the quotation marks)

RESULT: The letter you typed in step 2 appears in the table even though the
textbox object returned false.

If the text box simply resides on the form instead of within a grid and its Valid
event returns false, the form does not close. You would be in an endless loop
and unable to close Visual FoxPro.
