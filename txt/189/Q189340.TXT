TITLE   :XADM: Msg. Auto-Forwarded Though Automatic Replies Is Disabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Exchange Server 5.5 Internet Mail Service has a new feature that prevents
forwarding messages to the Internet. However, although the Exchange Server 5.5
Internet Mail Service is used, this function does not work when Exchange Server
5.0 exists in the organization and the Auto- Forwarding rule is set on the
Exchange Server 5.0 mailbox.

CAUSE
=====

The information store converts messages sent by the message transfer agent
(MTA). The Exchange Server 5.0 information store does not manage the flags that
indicate a message is forwarded. Consequently, the Internet Mail Service does
not "know" that a message has been forwarded and dispatches it to the Internet.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next service pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.

This fix has been posted to the following Internet location:
