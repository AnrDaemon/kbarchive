TITLE   :Exchange Server Databases Not Sent To Recycle Bin When Deleted
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Exchange Server databases may not be sent to the Recycle Bin when deleted,
even though the "Confirm File Delete - Are you sure you want to send "filename"
to the Recycle Bin?" dialog box appears.

CAUSE
=====

The space reserved and the maximum size of Recycle Bin is less than the size of
the database or file that was deleted.

This occurs with any file of any type on the system.

WORKAROUND
==========

There is no option to recover the deleted file; however, the Recycle Bin can be
configured to lessen the chance of this occurring again.

Configure the Maximum Size of Recycle Bin (percentage of drive) to allow greater
space to be used for the Recycle Bin.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To configure the Recycle Bin, in Explorer, select the Recycle Bin and choose
File Properties, or right-click the Recycle Bin icon and choose properties.

Additional query words: RecycleBin
