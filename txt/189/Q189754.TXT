TITLE   :XCON: Remote X.400 MTA May Abort the Connection to Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A third-party X.400 message transfer agent (MTA) may abort the connection to
Microsoft Exchange Server after receiving an RTSE Open Accept frame.

CAUSE
=====

The third-party MTA may try to open a connection to Microsoft Exchange Server
via an X.400 link without specifying the parameter "Window Size." This parameter
is optional in the RTSE Open Request frame. Microsoft Exchange Server answers
with an RTSE Open Accept frame asking for a "Window Size" of 5. According to the
X.228 specification, a "Window Size" of 3 has to be assumed if nothing else was
specified in the RTSE Open Request.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server version 5.5


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next service pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
