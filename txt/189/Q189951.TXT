   OK.

3. Place a WLCombo control on Form1.

4. Add the following code to the module of Form1:

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            Dim i
            For i = 1 to 20
               WLCombo1.Additem "testing.." & Str(i)
            Next i
         End Sub

5. Run the project.

6. Click on the WLCombo to drop it down. Try using the scroll bar to scroll the
   ComboBox. You will see the contents of the ComboBox scroll, but the scroll
