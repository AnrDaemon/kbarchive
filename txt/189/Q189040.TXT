When you send a print job to a file using print service, the file will
contain Graphical Device Interface (GDI) control characters and will be
illegible unless a Printer Definition Table (PDT) is specified. If a PDT is
used, the data still contains some control codes but can be displayed with
any text editor, such as WordPad.

It is also possible to use the Windows NT Generic/Text Only print driver to
print legible data to a file without using a PDT. The Generic/Text Only
print driver will not generate any printer commands in the file.

When a PDT is used, Windows GDI is not used. The PDT defines the
information used to generate the print output.

For additional information about printing with SNA Server, please refer to
the Microsoft SNA Print Service white paper. A copy of this white paper may
be obtained from Microsoft's SNA web site.
