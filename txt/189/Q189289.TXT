PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you reinstall Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5, the following error message
appears immediately after the Select Installation Type screen:

   Your upgrade did not complete successfully. Please restart your
   Microsoft Exchange Services and your system will behave as it did before
   the upgrade was attempted.
   Please contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
   Microsoft Exchange Server Setup
   ID: no. c1032c08

The message appears when Typical, Custom, or Minimum is selected as an
installation choice.

No additional errors are recorded in the application log.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT system path has been altered or deleted.

WORKAROUND
==========

In order to run, Setup.exe must have full access to %SystemRoot%\system32 and
%SystemRoot%.

To verify this, at a command prompt, type PATH <Enter>. Be sure that this
displays the actual path (for example: C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32;C:\WINNT) and not the
system variables referenced above.

The system path can be changed in the Control Panel Systems icon on the
Environment tab. When this has been modified correctly, the setup process will
not display the previous message.
