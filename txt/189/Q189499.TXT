TITLE   :FIX: VB5.EXE Application Error with UserControls in Project
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Large projects or project groups that contain UserControls that are not compiled
OCXs may experience the following application error:

   The instruction at "0x0fbb54bb" referenced memory at "0x00000000". The memory
   could not be "read".

This behavior occurs when either compiling the project or opening a form that may
contain a UserControl.

CAUSE
=====

The UserControls contain either references to global objects or circular
references to Forms/Modules within the project.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are three possible resolutions to this issue:

 - Select Options from the Tools menu, select the General tab, and then deselect
   Background Compile.

 - Use compiled OCXs in the project instead of having a UserControl project as
   part of the Project Group.

 - Late bind global object references within UserControls and attach them to
   instances at run-time.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in Visual Basic version
6.0.
