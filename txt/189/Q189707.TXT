SYMPTOMS
========

When you view the Type library for an object in the Class Browser, and
repeatedly click the +/- sign of a node in the right-hand pane, the following
error may occur:

   Help not available.

CAUSE

The Class Browser is designed to display help for an item when you double- click
the item. This is useful when a Type library, for example, contains help
information. Rapidly clicking the +/- sign in a Treeview control may fire the
double-click event.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

   pane.
