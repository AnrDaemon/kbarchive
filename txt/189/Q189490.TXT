The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Pack 1 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

 

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Contact Form "Display Map of Address" button on the toolbar in
the Outlook Web Access (OWA) client, the following error message may appear:

   "Unable to Find"

CAUSE
=====

In a Contact Form in the OWA client, the Display Map of Address toolbar button
is used as an address finder. It does not work correctly for non-USA addresses
and only searches for North American street addresses. When you use this feature
in OWA, non-USA addresses take you to the Place Finder page in Expedia, which
lets you see a less detailed area map. If, at that point, you enter a non-USA
address, the following error message appears:

   "Unable to find"

This is a function of Expedia and cannot be changed on the OWA client.
