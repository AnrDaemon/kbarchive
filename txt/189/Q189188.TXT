TITLE   :SMS: Miperf.bat - Add MIF File Counters to Performance Monitor
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsmsUtil smsutil

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Miperf.bat, a utility that is available in the Microsoft BackOffice Resource
Kit, adds a new set of counters to Performance Monitor. These counters monitor
the number of MIF files being processed by the Dataloader. The name of the new
Performance Monitor object is SMS_MIFS. For a definition of the counters, see
the Explain text in Performance Monitor. MIPERF must be run on the computer that
is running the Systems Management Server site services.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Usage Notes
-----------

The New MIFs counter can only be displayed by using the Performance Monitor in
Windows NT Server or Windows NT Workstation, version 4.0 or later. Total MIFs
counter works with any Performance Monitor.

The Total MIFs value is stored once per server, which means that when you first
open a counter for Total MIFs, it starts at 0 and counts up. If you start a
second instance of Performance Monitor, it starts with the number that was last
shown in the first instance of Performance Monitor. If you close all instances
of Performance Monitor and then start the Total MIFs counter, it starts at 0
again.

The counters work by reading the log file. If you turn off tracing for the
Dataloader, the counters no longer work.

Some MIF files (such as User Group MIF files) contain multiple MIF files per
file; that is, if you have 100 user groups, the Dataloader reports 100 machines
processed while it processes this MIF file. The counter then shows this as 100
MIF files processed.

Despite these limitations, this counter presents a reasonable view of the
performance of the Dataloader if it is used over a several day period.

Removing MIPERF
---------------

To remove this software, run the following command:

      unlodctr SMS_Mifs

Unlodctr is provided with Windows NT Server.

NOTE: Do not simply delete the registry keys. Doing so may cause you to lose
other Performance Monitor counters.

Runs on Alpha, MIPS, and x86.

Files Required for MIPERF
-------------------------

   Miperf.dll
   Smsperf.dll

The following files are required to install the SMS_MIFS counter, but can safely
be removed after installation:

   Miperf.bat
   Mictrnm.h
   Mi.ini
