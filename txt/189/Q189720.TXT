TITLE   :BUG: _SCREEN.Height/Width May Increase When BorderStyle Is Set
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The values of SCREEN.Height or _SCREEN.Width may increase after setting the
value of _SCREEN.BorderStyle.

RESOLUTION
==========

As a workaround, you can store the current values for _SCREEN.Height and
_SCREEN.Width, set the value for _SCREEN.BorderStyle, then reset _SCREEN.Height
and _SCREEN.Width back to the stored values.

For example, run the following code from a program (.prg) file:

      LOCAL lnOriginalHeight, lnOriginalWidth
      PUBLIC ox
      CLEAR
      SET STATUS BAR ON
      ox=CREATEOBJECT('toolbar')
      ox.Width = 35
      ox.Dock(1)
      ox.Show()
      lnOriginalHeight = _SCREEN.Height
      lnOriginalWidth = _SCREEN.Width
      _SCREEN.BorderStyle = 3

      * Next 2 lines are workaround
      _SCREEN.Height= lnOriginalHeight
      _SCREEN.Width = lnOriginalWidth
      * End of workaround code

      ?'Change in Height =', _SCREEN.Height - lnOriginalHeight
      ?'Change in Width =', _SCREEN.Width - lnOriginalWidth

The height and width are changed, but they are reset to their original values.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior can occur if _SCREEN.BorderStyle is reset to its current value, or
to a new value. The amount of any increase depends on the presence of docked
toolbars, or the Visual FoxPro Status Bar.

If the Visual FoxPro Status Bar is present, _SCREEN.Height increases by 24 when
_SCREEN.BorderStyle is set.

If any toolbars (either system or user defined) are docked to the top or bottom
of the Visual FoxPro desktop, _SCREEN.Height increases by the height of the
toolbar or toolbars.

If any toolbars (either system or user defined) are docked to the left or right
of the Visual FoxPro desktop, _SCREEN.Width increases by the width of the
toolbar or toolbars. Undocked toolbars do not cause this effect.

Note also that the effect is additive. For example, if two toolbars of height 32
are docked, one to the top and one at the bottom of the Visual FoxPro desktop,
and the Status Bar is visible, the _SCREEN.Height increases by 24+32+32, or 88
pixels.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Make sure you are showing the Standard toolbar in Visual FoxPro. You can show
   the toolbar if it is not visible; on the View menu, click Toolbars. Select
   the Standard check box in the list in the Toolbars dialog box.

2. Run the following code from a program (.prg) file:

         LOCAL lnOriginalHeight, lnOriginalWidth
         PUBLIC ox
         CLEAR
         SET STATUS BAR ON
         ox=CREATEOBJECT('toolbar')
         ox.Width = 35
         ox.Dock(1)
         ox.Show()
         lnOriginalHeight = _SCREEN.Height
         lnOriginalWidth = _SCREEN.Width
         _SCREEN.BorderStyle = 3
         ?'Change in Height =', _SCREEN.Height - lnOriginalHeight
         ?'Change in Width =', _SCREEN.Width - lnOriginalWidth

The height of _SCREEN is increased by 56, and the width of _SCREEN is increased
by 35.
