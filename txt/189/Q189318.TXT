======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Windows Messaging in Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 to
create a new fax that is scheduled to be sent at a certain time instead of being
sent immediately, and you include one or more files with the fax, the fax may
never be sent.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the fax's properties are modified while the fax is
still in the outbound queue. After the Messaging Application Programming
Interface (MAPI) dynamic-link library (DLL) is notified that the properties have
been modified, the DLL may indicate that the properties were modified at the
same time as the original fax was submitted. As a result, the fax is never sent.
