                                          interface. By default, Users
                                          and Guests have Read and

Changing permissions on the SMS_SHR share or the directories that exist below the
share is not recommended. Systems Management Server clients need the ability to
create and rename files in most of these directories. If permissions are
changed, Systems Management Server functionality may be adversely affected.
