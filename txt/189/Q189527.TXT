======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try use your Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2-based computer to create
a new folder on a Microsoft Windows NT Server-based computer's NTFS partition,
you may receive the following error message:

   Unable to create directory.

This problem may occur even though you have full file permissions to the folder
in which the new folder is being created.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you do not have full file permissions to a parent
folder under which the new folder is being created. In Windows 95 OEM Service
Release 2 (OSR2), the full path is verified when a new folder is created, so if
you do not have permissions at one of the folder levels in the path, the error
message is generated.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.
