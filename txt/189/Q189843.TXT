The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 97, version 8.03 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install an Outlook client, the following error may occur:

   ActiveEx was not able to register itself in the system registry

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when the Outlook client is installed in a shared Windows 95
environment. The installation will not proceed successfully if ActiveEx.dll file
cannot be installed locally.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, either install the Outlook client locally, or
during the installation process, uncheck the option that installs the Event
Scripting Service. This will allow the ActiveEx.dll file to be installed
locally.
