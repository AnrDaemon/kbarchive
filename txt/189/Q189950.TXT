SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Windowless Controls must be installed manually. Installation of
these controls is not an option in the Visual Basic / Visual Studio 6.0 setup
program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The files required for the Windowless Controls are located in the folder
Common\Tools\VB\Winless on the Visual Basic CD-ROM. This folder is located on
Disk #3 if you are installing from Visual Studio. The following files are
present in that folder:

   MSWLESS.dep
   MSWLESS.reg
   MSWLESS.ocx
   LTWTCT98.chi
   LTWTCT98.chm

Step-by-Step Instructions
-------------------------

1. Locate the Common\Tools\VB\Winless folder.

2. Copy the two help files, LTWTCT98.*, to the Windows\Help folder, and the
   remaining three files to the Windows\System folder.

   -or-

   Copy all five files to the Windows\System folder.

3. Register MSWLESS.OCX by either Browsing to it in Visual Basic itself, or
   manually registering it using RegSvr32.Exe. RegSvr32.EXE can be found in the
   Common\Tools\VB\Regutils folder. The command line is:

      RegSvr32.Exe C:\Windows\System\MSWLESS.OCX

4. Register the design -ime license for the control. To do this, double-click
   the MSWLESS.REG file in Windows Explorer. This will merge the file into your
   registry. Alternatively, you can merge this file into your registry by
   running RegEdit.Exe. The command line is:

      RegEdit.Exe C:\Windows\System\MSWLESS.REG
