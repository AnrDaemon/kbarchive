SUMMARY
=======

Installation macros can be used throughout the steps of the Package and
Deployment Wizard (PDW) to install files to specific locations. This article
documents the available installation macros and what the macros will equate to
during the installation process.

MORE INFORMATION
================

These macros will be used by both Setup.exe and Setup1.exe to install files to
common system directories. These macros may be modified after the distribution
set has been created by modifying the Setup.lst file created by the PDW. See the
REFERENCES section of this article for additional information regarding Setup1
files and Bootstrap files.

The paths below are typical paths to the Windows\System directory. This macro
can be used for both Setup1 Files and Bootstrap Files.

   \Windows\System (Windows 95 or later)
   \Winnt\System32 (Windows NT 4.0 and later)

$(WinSysPathSysFile)
This macro installs files to the System subdirectory as well, but the file is
