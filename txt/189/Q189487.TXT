PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Pack 1 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Netscape Navigator version 3.0 or later and the Outlook Web Access
client, to try to open the Outlook 98 welcome messages that have the subjects
"Welcome to Microsoft Outlook 98!" or "Special Offers for Outlook Users", a Dr.
Watson error may appear in Windows NT with the following text:

   netscape.exe
   Exception: access violation (0xc0000005), Address: 0x00450521f

The memory address location may vary.

Opening either message in Outlook Web Access under Windows 95 or Windows 98 may
produce an illegal operation error. Getting details on the error shows the
following text:

   NETSCAPE caused an invalid page fault in module NETSCAPE.EXE at
   015f:00407376.

The memory address location may vary.

WORKAROUND
==========

This error can be avoided by not opening the Welcome message in the Outlook Web
Access client when using the Netscape browser. This is the only message that
seems to cause the error. You can open the Welcome message correctly in the
Outlook client or the Outlook Web Access client if you use a different browser.

STATUS
======

This problem occurs when you use Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5, or
version 5.5 Service Pack 1, with Netscape Navigator version 3.0 or later.
