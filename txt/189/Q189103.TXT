The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Windows NT Client Server Tools on a computer running
Windows NT Workstation 4.0 so that you can perform Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol (DHCP) administration, you notice that the superscoping feature is
missing.

RESOLUTION
==========

To be able to set up and administer superscopes from a computer running the
Windows NT Client Server Tools, you will need to copy Dhcpadmn.exe and
Dhcpsapi.dll from the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder on an NT 4.0 SP3 (or higher)
DHCP server to the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder on the Windows NT Workstation
computer running the Client Server Tools.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) administration can be performed from
a Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0 computer by installing the Windows NT
Client Server Tools (located on the Windows NT Server CD in the
\Clients\SrvTools\WinNT folder).
