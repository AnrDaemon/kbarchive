SYMPTOMS

mailboxes, the Administrator program may incorrectly indicate that the password
for the Windows NT account is blank.

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. If you are not severely affected by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the French Exchange Server
versions 5.0 and 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the Windows NT Account Policy is set to have a minimum password length, the
Exchange Server administrator program is responsible for creating the Windows NT
account and the password for the account. For example, set the Windows NT
Account Policy to have a minimum password length of ten characters. From the
Exchange Server Administrator program, create a mailbox named Test. For the
primary account, choose to create a new Windows NT account. After the account is
created, the following dialog will appear:

   Le compte Windows NT que vous venez de creer a un mot de posse vide.
   L'utilisateur devra changer le mot de passe lors de sa premiere
   overature de session.

The first part says that the password is blank or empty (vide). This is actually
wrong because the Administrator program created the account with a password of
"testxxxxxx". This can be verified by connecting to the server or by logging
onto the server, if the account is given the appropriate privileges.
