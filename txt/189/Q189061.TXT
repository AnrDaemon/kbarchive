SYMPTOMS
========

When you repeatedly save and restore a registry key in Windows NT, the registry
hive may eventually become corrupted.

CAUSE
=====

If you save a registry key to disk, and then later restore it over another key
where the key name length is different (that is, longer than the original key
name), it causes the actual allocated storage for the key to grow. If you repeat
this process enough times, eventually the storage assigned to this key becomes
so large that the registry check code declares the hive corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
