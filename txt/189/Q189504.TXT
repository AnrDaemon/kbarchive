TITLE   :PRB: Menu Builder Creates Duplicate Hot Keys
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Creating a menu with pads that begin with the same letter causes duplicate hot
keys to be created. This behavior exists because the first letter of the menu
prompt is used for the hot key by default.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design.

RESOLUTION
==========

Create a hot key manually by prefacing the hot key letter with "\<" (without
the quotes). This identifies the subsequent letter as the assigned hot key.

As a example, to set "1" as the hot key in the menu prompt, "Test1", the menu
prompt would be "Test\<1" (without the quotation marks).

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a menu.

2. Add the following two prompts:

   " Test1, Test2" (without the quotation marks)

3. Preview the menu.

   The "T" in each prompt is identified as the hot key.
