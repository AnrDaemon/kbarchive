The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

When you send an e-mail message to Outlook 97 or 98 using the MAPI OLE container
controls in Visual FoxPro for Windows, your e-mail messages might not leave the
Outbox.

MORE INFORMATION
================

One possible cause of this problem is that Outlook has the Internet Mail Only
(IMO) option installed, you are working offline, and you have not made a remote
connection.

If the e-mail message you sent is stuck in the Outbox, use the following code to
force Outlook to send the message:

      oOutlook = GETOBJECT(,"Outlook.Application")
      oNameSpace= oOutlook.GetNamespace("MAPI")
      oFolder = oNameSpace.GetDefaultfolder(4)     && Go to Outbox, folder 4
      oSend = oFolder.Items(1).Send                && Send waiting items

To test this code, create a new e-mail message addressed to yourself. Save and
close the message without sending it. Move this message to the Outbox and run
the preceding code. This should make Outlook send the message.
