Pgs. 104 & 114: Win98 Upgrade Requirements
------------------------------------------

The "Warning" note on page 104 states that if you are installing the Windows 98
upgrade after formatting your hard disk, you must have the Windows 95 or Windows
3.x floppy disk 1 to get through the Windows 98 piracy protection scheme. The
note also states that the Windows 95 compact disc will not work.

This is incorrect. In order to be eligible for the Windows 98 Upgrade, you must
be a licensed user of one of the following qualifying products:

 - Windows 95

 - Windows 3.1

 - Windows for Workgroups

Correction:

Change the second "warning" on page 104 and the "note" on page 114 to read as
follows:

   If you are installing the Windows 98 upgrade after formatting your hard disk,
   you must have the CD-ROM or floppy disks for Windows 95 or Windows 3.x to get
   through the piracy-protection scheme.


If you do not have one of the qualifying products, you are not eligible for the
Windows 98 upgrade. You will need to purchase the full version for computers
without Windows.

To confirm your eligibility for the Windows 98 Upgrade, Windows 98 setup will
perform the following checks:

1. Setup will check your hard drive to verify that you have one of these
   qualifying products.

2. If you are doing a clean installation (you first formatted your hard drive),
   you must have your original floppy disks or CD-ROM for one of the qualifying
   products available during setup.

Setup will not continue until it has verified your eligibility through one of
these two methods.

Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of the book, it may already
contain the above corrections.
