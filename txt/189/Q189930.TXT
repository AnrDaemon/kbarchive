-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook for Macintosh, Exchange Server Edition, version 8.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open or create a new message using an Exchange or Outlook
client for Macintosh, the following error may occur:

   The items could not be displayed. You have exceeded the maximum amount of
   text.

CAUSE
=====

This error may be caused by a corrupt font that is used to display the message
text.

WORKAROUND
==========

To test for a corrupted font, open the system folder and drag the fonts folder
to the desktop. Shut down and restart the system. A new fonts folder will be
created in the system folder with a default system font.

After you restart the computer, open the Exchange or Outlook client again and
test the message. The contents should be displayed in the default system font.
If this works correctly, replace the affected font(s). If the same symptoms
occur, it may be necessary to remove and reinstall the Exchange or Outlook
client software.
