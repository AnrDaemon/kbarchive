TITLE   :XFOR: Outbound SMTP Msgs. Don't Flow w/ IMC/IMS Service Running
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Outbound SMTP messages may not flow with the IMC/IMS service running, but will
flow when the Msexchimc.exe command is run from a command prompt. Inbound SMTP
messages work fine with the service.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is usually caused by a corrupt or invalid service account. To
verify this possibility, log on to the computer as the service account and
attempt to send a message when running from the command prompt. If this does not
work, check the properties of the service account.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you must recreate this service account and confirm
that it has the proper permissions. Please see the following Knowledge Base
article(s) for further information:

   Q147701 XADM: Exchange Service Account Permissions


MORE INFORMATION
================

The reason that outbound messages flow when the IMC/IMS is started from the
command prompt is that the Virtual MS-DOS Machine (VDM) is using the account
permissions of the user logged on (most frequently the Administrator) rather
than the Service Account permissions that the service uses.
