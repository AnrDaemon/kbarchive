SYMPTOMS
========

When a table in the header extends into the document body, a blank line appears
between the header and the first line of text.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design of Microsoft Word. When a table is inserted or placed
in a document, a paragraph mark is always inserted below the table. In addition,
a paragraph mark always precedes a table in Word. In this case it is used to
store paragraph, section, or document formatting.

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid having the blank line appear when the document is printed, follow these
steps:

1. On the View menu, click Header/Footer.

2. Select the paragraph mark at the end of the table in the header. If the
   paragraph marker in not visible, click the Show/Hide button on the Standard
   toolbar.

3. On the Format menu, click Paragraph.

4. Click the Indents And Spacing tab.

5. From the Line Spacing list, select Exactly. In the At box, type ".01 in"
   (without the quotation marks) or ".7 pt" (without the quotation marks).

   The blank line is now very small, making it "invisible."

   NOTE: You can format the font as Hidden for that paragraph marker too.
