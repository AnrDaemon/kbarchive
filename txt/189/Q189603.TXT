TITLE   :INFO: NewObject Command Respects the SET PROCEDURE Command

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The NewObject function temporarily overrides the SET CLASSLIB and SET PROCEDURE
commands in order to create an object from a specific class and class library.
The SET PROCEDURE TO setting is retained, however, during the initialization of
the NewObject object, in the event that the information in a procedure is
required.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the following example, an object instantiated using the NewObject command
calls a procedure located in a .prg file:

1. Create a class named ProcTest in a class library name SetProcTest as
   follows:

   CREATE CLASS ProcTest of SetProcTest as Custom

2. In the Init Event of ProcTest, place the following code and save the class:

         lcValue = InitFunction()
         MESSAGEBOX(lcValue)

3. Create a procedure called TestProg with the following code:

         PROCEDURE InitFunction
            RETURN "Hello"

4. In the Command window, issue the following commands:

         SET PROCEDURE to TestProg
         oProcTest = NEWOBJECT("ProcTest", "SetProcTest")

Although the NewObject function performs its own SET CLASSLIB and SET PROCEDURE
commands, in order to instantiate an object, the ability to use SET CLASSLIB or
SET PROCEDURE settings previously invoked allows additional flexibility in this
command. The SET CLASSLIB and SET PROCEDURE commands remain available to the
NewObject command and do not have to be re-issued during the instantiation of an
object.
