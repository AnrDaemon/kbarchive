SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to access the Microsoft Exchange Outlook Web Access logon
screen via a browser by typing the new alias name such as
http://servername/exchange2, one of the following errors may be displayed:

   Directory Listing Denied
   This Virtual Directory does not allow contents to be listed.
   (IIS 4.0 Error Message)

CAUSE

The error can occur if the Exchange alias name has been changed to something
other than /Exchange in the IIS WWW Service properties.

WORKAROUND

If you change the alias name back to /Exchange and restart the World Wide Web
