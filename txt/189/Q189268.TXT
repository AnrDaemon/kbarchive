TITLE   :XADM: Encrypted Message Unreadable When TNEF Is Turned On
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5

SYMPTOMS
========

Encrypted messages sent to a transport-neutral encapsulation format (TNEF)
recipient arrive as attachments and are unreadable if Internet Mail (IMAIL) is
configured for TNEF.

CAUSE
=====

This problem resulted when S/MIME encrypted messages were being sent as TNEF
attachments when sent to a TNEF recipient, resulting in the received message
being unreadable. TNEF has subsequently been disabled on outbound for encrypted
messages.

STATUS
======
