SUMMARY
=======

This article shows you how to implement context-sensitive HTML Help in a Visual
Basic application.

Also, this article assumes that you have created an HTML Help (.chm) file to use
with context-sensitive help.

For additional information on creating HTML help files, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191118 : HOWTO: Create Context-Sensitive HTML Help in an MFC Application

The information in this article is most useful for Visual Basic 4.0 and 5.0
applications. Visual Basic 6.0 has added support for HTML Help files that
eliminates the need for calling the API directly. See Visual Basic's online help
for more information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Perform the following steps in your Visual Basic application:

1. Create a new project, Form1 is created by default. Add a few controls to the
   form.

2. Add a module to the project, and add the following constants to the
   declaration section of the module:

         Public Const HH_HELP_CONTEXT = &HF

         Public Const MYHELP_FILE = "myfile.chm"

   NOTE: "myfile.chm" is the path and name of the HTML Help file (.chm) you
   created earlier.

3. Add the following HTML Help API declaration to the module:

         Public Declare Function HtmlHelpLongArg Lib "hhctrl.ocx" _
             Alias "HtmlHelpA" (ByVal hwndCaller As Long, _
             ByVal pszFile As String, ByVal uCommand As Long, _
             ByVal dwData As Long) As Long

4. Intercept the form's KeyUp method to capture the F1 key using the following
   sample code in the Form KeyUp event procedure:

         Private Sub Form_KeyUp(KeyCode As Integer, Shift As Integer)
            dim iRetCode As Long
            If KeyCode = vbKeyF1 Then
                iRetCode = HtmlHelpLongArg(Me.ActiveControl.hWnd,_
                 MYHELP_FILE,HH_HELP_CONTEXT,Me.ActiveControl.HelpContextID)
            End If
         End Sub

5. Set the form's KeyPreview, WhatsThisHelp, and WhatsThisButton properties to
   TRUE.

6. Set the HelpContextID property of each control on the form to a value from
   the help project file's MAP section.

7. Run the Visual Basic application. Select a control on the form and press the
   F1 key. The appropriate context-sensitive help topic should appear on the
   screen.
