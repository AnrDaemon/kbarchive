TITLE   :WD97: Visio Unexpected Quits Clicking Open on View Menu
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbole

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Visio may close unexpectedly (timing varies) when you edit an embedded Visio
object in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows. Visio unexpectedly closes when you
double-click the Visio object to edit it in-place and then click Open on the
View menu.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because of the Word Idle task feature, which automatically
unloads OLE servers that are deactivated.


WORKAROUND
==========

You can work around this behavior by right-clicking the Visio object in Word,
and then selecting Visio Object Open on the menu that appears. Opening Visio in
this manner bypasses the Idle Task feature and allows Visio to remain open until
you close it manually.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visio is a drawing package, manufactured by Visio Corporation, that lets you
assemble illustrations and diagrams by dragging objects created from stencils,
called SmartShapes. The Visio program installs icons on the Word and Excel
toolbars so that you can easily insert Visio drawings.
