TITLE   :PRB: CWnd::m_nMsgDragList Not Exported by the MFC DLL
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnokeyword kbDLL kbMFC kbVC500 kbGrpDSMFCATL kbArchitecture

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the protected CWnd member m_nMsgDragList in an application or DLL
that is linked to the MFC shared DLL, a LNK2001 unresolved external error
occurs.

This error does not occur when you link to the static MFC library.

CAUSE
=====

CWnd::m_nMsgDragList is not exported from the MFC DLL.

RESOLUTION
==========

To workaround this problem, call RegisterWindowMessage with the
DRAGLISTMSGSTRING message and use the value returned instead of
CWnd::m_nMsgDragList. For example:

      UINT nMsgDragList = ::RegisterWindowMessage(DRAGLISTMSGSTRING);

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

CWnd::m_nMsgDragList is an undocumented member of the CWnd class and is subject
to change. The most common use of CWnd::m_nMsgDragList occurs when you override
OnChildNotify in a CWnd derived class.
