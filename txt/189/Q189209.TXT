SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install "Microsoft Office 97 Starts Here", you may receive
an error message advising you that you do not have the required 16.9 megabytes
(MB) free space on your drive necessary to install the product. However, you may
have over 2 gigabytes (GB) free space on your hard drive.

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused by a problem in the Setup program. The Setup program does
not recognize free space correctly on drives with over 2 GB of free space.

WORKAROUND
==========

Install "Microsoft Office 97 Starts Here" to a volume with less than 2 GB of
free space. To do this:

 - Install the program to a different volume on your hard drive.

 - Fill up as much free space as needed to bring the total free space to less
   than 2 GB.

As a last resort, you can use the FDISK utility to repartition your hard drive.
This utility will allow you to create a volume on your hard drive that is less
than 2 GB. Please see your operating system help files or printed documentation
for further information on the FDISK utility.

WARNING: Using FDISK on a drive with existing data will PERMANENTLY ERASE all
data currently on your hard drive. Do not attempt this procedure without first
making a full backup of all your data.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in "Microsoft Office 97 Starts
Here."
