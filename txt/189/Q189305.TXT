TITLE   :SMS: Packages Run at a Different Time Than Specified
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbPCM smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When sending packages with Systems Management Server, you may notice that
clients in another time zone run the package at a different time than what is
specified in the Job Details window. Normally, the package should start on
individual clients when the client's time is the same as or after the specified
start time.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Package Command Manager (PCM) has built-in support
for daylight savings time, which causes it to change the execution time.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
