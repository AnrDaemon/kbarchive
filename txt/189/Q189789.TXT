TITLE   :XFOR: Linkage 3.2 PROFS Connector Repeatedly Restarts Itself
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - LinkAge Message Exchange, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Linkage Message Exchange 3.2 Exchange-OfficeVision/VM Connector may
repeatedly halt outbound (to PROFs) message processing and restart itself.

Additionally, events similar to the following may be logged in the Exchange
Connectivity Manager's Log Browser:

   LME-PROFS-MEXOUT: 31200 Microsoft Exchange has returned the condition
   80070057
   LME-PROFS-MEXOUT: 31201 Microsoft package ID: Win32
   LME-PROFS-MEXOUT: 31203 Extended NT Information: The parameter is
   incorrect
   LME-PROFS-MEXOUT: 31055 Exchange/MAPI unable to generate valid address,
   connection may be down
   LME-PROFS-MEXOUT: 31200 Microsoft Exchange has returned the condition
   80070057
   LME-PROFS-MEXOUT: 31201 Microsoft package ID: Win32
   LME-PROFS-MEXOUT: 31203 Extended NT Information: The parameter is
   incorrect
   LME-PROFS-MEXOUT: 31056 Unable to create valid proxy address
   LME-PROFS-MEXOUT: 31051 Unable to complete mapping of Exchange address
   to proxy address
   LME-PROFS-MEXOUT: 31013 Attempting automatic LinkAge Exchange Interface
   restart to clear temporary resource problem
   LME-PROFS-MEXOUT: 00514 A RESTART request has been received
   LME-PROFS-MEXOUT: 00505 LME-PROFS-MEXOUT is ending, last return code as
   {A shutdown request was made}

CAUSE
=====

The Lsmexout.exe process of the Exchange-OfficeVision/VM Connector encounters
only spaces (0x20) in the PR_DISPLAY_NAME property of a target recipient address
when it attempts to send a message over to PROFS. This is interpreted as an RPC
error, causing the process to terminate. The terminated process is automatically
restarted and the same message is processed, resulting in this looping terminate
and restart behavior.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Linkage Message Exchange
Connector for PROFS version 3.2.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next service pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
