SUMMARY

The Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) provides technical information and
development toolkits for all developers who write applications for Microsoft
operating systems. MSDN members receive a quarterly CD-ROM disk and a bimonthly
newsletter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MSDN CD-ROM disk contains a wealth of information, including the entire
Microsoft Developer Support Knowledge Base, the Microsoft Windows SDK
documentation, and Charles Petzold's book "Programming Windows 3.1."
