SUMMARY
=======

When you use Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with certain NDIS 2 network adapter
drivers, you must specify command-line parameters to make these drivers load
correctly. These parameters can be added by editing the SYSTEM.INI file with a
text editor such as Microsoft Windows Notepad.

Below is an example in which the real-mode drivers for a Xircom credit card
adapter are loaded in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

      CECFG DRIVER=NDIS
      CENDIS

When these NDIS 2 drivers are loaded with Windows for Workgroups 3.11, they are
loaded on the transport= line of the SYSTEM.INI file. To pass the DRIVER=NDIS
parameter to CECFG.EXE, add the following line to the [network drivers] section
of the SYSTEM.INI file:

      [network drivers]
      CECFG.EXE="Driver=NDIS"

Additional query words: 3.11 ndis2 cmd line
