Mail Message Displays Name in Single Quotation Marks
----------------------------------------------------

   Q99055

In version 1.0 of Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, if you reply to a message
sent to yourself, the copy you receive in your Inbox incorrectly displays your
name in single quotation marks. This is inconsistent with the way your name is
displayed in a standard mail message.

For example, the copy of the message you receive in your Inbox displays your name
as:

   To: 'Your Name'

A standard mail message displays your name as:

   To: Your Name

Resolved Names Are Not Underlined
---------------------------------

   Q99057

and you select the Check Names button, the resolved names are not underlined.

---------------------------------

   Q99697

-------------------------------------------

   Q104361

When you attach a file to the routing form included with version 1.0 of Microsoft
Electronic Forms Designer, the directory listed in the Attach File to Be Routed
dialog box is the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory. This may be inconsistent with other
Windows applications, which default to the WINDOWS directory.

Custom Form Not Displayed
