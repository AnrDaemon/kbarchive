TITLE   :BUG: GP Fault in LoadLibrary() with C++ DLL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When loading a dynamic-link library (DLL) developed with Microsoft C/C++ 7.0 or
Visual C++ with a large number of exports not listed in the module definition
(.DEF) file, LoadLibrary() will cause a general protection (GP) fault in Kernel
with the message:

   Application Error MYAPP caused a General Protection Fault in module
   KRNL386.EXE at 0002:0E8D

CAUSE
=====

The cause of the GP fault is the unusually large amount of exported decorated
C++ names in the resident name table in the executable header. The Windows
loader is not designed to handle the resident portion of the executable header
larger than 64K.

RESOLUTION
==========

The GP fault can be eliminated by reducing the size the resident name table by
listing the exported function names along with an ordinal number in the EXPORTS
section of the .DEF file. Because the compiler generates decorated names, it is
easier to copy the decorated function names from the .MAP file to the .DEF file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Microsoft Windows version 3.1 and
Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1 and 3.11. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.

MORE INFORMATION
================


The error also occurs when loading the 16-bit DLL on Windows 95.

Although our linker does not support this feature, some 3rd-party linkers such as
OptLink has a switch that will automatically set the names destined for the
non-resident name table without doing the copy/paste operation from the .MAP
file to the .DEF file.
