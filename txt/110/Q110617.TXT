SUMMARY
=======

When you use Weather Generation at Startup, the indicated altitude is
approximately 200 feet lower than normal.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is due to the difference in barometric pressure between the startup
situation's weather information and the new weather generated at startup. To
calibrate the altimeter for the new barometric pressure, press the B key on the
keyboard or click Calibrate Altimeter on the Sim menu and enter the new
barometric pressure.

To reproduce this situation follow these steps:

1. Start Flight Simulator 5.0.

2. From the Options menu, click Preferences.

3. Click Weather Generation at Startup and click OK.

4. Exit and restart Flight Simulator.

   is 377ft MSL.)

6. Press the B key on the keyboard.
