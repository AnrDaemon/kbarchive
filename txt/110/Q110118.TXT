SUMMARY
=======

Windows created in FoxPro for Macintosh can be defined as residing on the
Macintosh desktop, which is a state that does not exist in Windows or MS-DOS.

The WPARENT() command in FoxPro for Macintosh has been updated to return
"MACDESKTOP" if the window being checked is a Macintosh desktop style window.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, if the window titled "Updates" were a Macintosh desktop window, its
status could be checked by issuing the following command:

        WPARENT("Updates")

The text string "MACDESKTOP" would be returned.
