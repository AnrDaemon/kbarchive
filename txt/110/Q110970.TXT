======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The ON SHUTDOWN command specifies a command that executes when you try to exit
FoxPro for Windows or Microsoft Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The command specified in ON SHUTDOWN is executed if you try to exit FoxPro for
Windows by double-clicking the FoxPro Control-menu box, by choosing Exit from
the FoxPro Control menu, or by issuing the QUIT command in the Command window or
in a program.

If you try to exit Microsoft Windows from the Windows Program Manager while
FoxPro for Windows is open, control is returned to FoxPro for Windows and the
command you specify in ON SHUTDOWN is executed.

The ON SHUTDOWN command is typically a DO command that executes a routine to
display a dialog box. The dialog box asks if you are sure you want to exit the
current application and FoxPro for Windows. If you want to exit the application,
the routine can close any open files, clean up the FoxPro for Windows
environment, and then execute the QUIT command. If you don't want to exit the
current application, the routine can return control to the application.

NOTE: If you cannot exit the development version of FoxPro for Windows, try
typing "ON SHUTDOWN" (without the quotation marks) in the Command window to
clear the current ON SHUTDOWN command and allow FoxPro for Windows to exit
normally.

Command Window Example
----------------------

1. Type the following in the Command window:

         ON SHUTDOWN DO cleanup.prg

2. Create a program named CLEANUP.PRG containing the following code:

         WAIT WINDOW "Performing clean-up tasks" NOWAIT
         * Place the code here that you want FoxPro to execute when it
         * quits.
         QUIT  && Force FoxPro to quit

3. Quit FoxPro using any method.

Note that the WAIT WINDOW message is displayed when you try to quit FoxPro.
