TITLE   :BUG: L1103 Error Caused by Incorrectly Nested Segments
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::6.0,6.0a,6.0b,6.1,6.11,6.1a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b, 6.1, 6.1a, 6.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a simplified segment directive is used when two segments are already open,
the resulting object file may generate the following error when it is linked:

   fatal error L1103: attempt to access data outside segment bounds

RESOLUTION
==========

The code shown below illustrates a case where this problem will occur. The
comment lines show how to resolve the problem by closing one or more of the
nested segments.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 6.x. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code sample illustrates the problem. When the simplified directive
.CODE is encountered in this sample, only one of the previously opened segments
is closed and the error results. If either or both of the ENDS statements is
placed in the code, the program will link correctly.

Sample Code
-----------

   ; Assemble options needed: none
   .MODEL large,c
   .STACK
    
   myseg SEGMENT
       mydata WORD 1
   ;myseg ENDS   ; fixes the problem

   myseg2 SEGMENT
       data2 WORD 2

   ;myseg2 ENDS  ; fixes the problem

   .CODE
       .STARTUP
       ASSUME ds:myseg
       mov dx, SEG mydata
       mov ds, dx
       mov ax, mydata
       ASSUME ds:myseg2
       mov dx, SEG mydata2
       mov ds, dx
       mov ax, mydata2
       .EXIT
