TITLE   :BUG: Palettes Realized in a Memory DC May Corrupt Screen
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a 256-color display, when a palette is realized into a memory device context
(DC), its colors are entered into the system palette, which may corrupt the
current screen.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Windows version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The premise behind the Windows Palette Manager code is that the current top-
level window has priority over all other running applications in letting the
system palette. When the active window sets a foreground palette, other windows
in the system that use the palette may have their colors changed if there is not
enough room for them to realize a background palette. This behavior is normal
and is expected. What is not expected is to have colors change when a palette is
selected and realized into a memory DC returned by CreateCompatibleDC().
