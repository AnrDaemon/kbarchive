======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator for MS-DOS, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When using the Crop Duster World (CROPW.VIS) scenery library, you may encounter
screen corruption in certain areas.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In some areas in the Crop Duster World scenery the graphics below the horizon
fail to redraw correctly. This results in a smearing effect of the graphics.
This behavior has been observed in the Chicago Meigs Field and Chicago Midway
areas but may occur in other areas as well.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start Flight Simulator 5.0.

2. If you are using a startup situation other than Meigs Takeoff Runway 36,
   switch to the Chicago Meigs Field airport.

3. From the Scenery menu, click Scenery Library.

4. Click the Crop Duster World scenery area.

5. Takeoff and set View 1 to Chase view by pressing the S key twice.

Notice that the aircraft and scenery below the horizon seem to smear as the
graphics change. Scenery above the horizon redraws correctly.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Flight Simulator for MS-DOS,
version 5.0.
