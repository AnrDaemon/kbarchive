KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Post Office Diagnostics Utility, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Postoffice Diagnostics Utility (PODIAG.EXE) has a
tool known as the General Postoffice Summary. When you run the General
Postoffice Summary on a Windows for Workgroups Version 3.1 postoffice, it will
display a summary indicating that the following gateways are installed:

   PROFS, MCI, X.400, Fax, DEC, Unix, OV, MS Gate

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Mail Postoffice Diagnostics Utility does not check to see that the
postoffice is a workgroup postoffice. Therefore, it interprets the gateway flags
in the MASTER.GLB as being set for installed gateways.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
Postoffice Diagnostics Utility. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
