The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

Some services (such as NetLogon, Server, and Workstation) have the option of
being paused or stopped. You may expect that no connections would be effected
when you pause a service, but there may be other consequences. Details on the
effects of pausing a service are not included in the System Guide.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, when you pause the Server service, the results are:

 - It does not affect the connections of the existing users.

 - It does not allow new connections to the server for users with user level
   privilege even if you have an established session to this server before the
   server was paused.

 - It allows new connection to users who are members of the DomainAdmins,
   Administrators, and Power Users groups.

The behavior of a service when it is paused depends on the service, but mostly
revolve around granting special privileges to accounts belonging to privileged
groups.
