SUMMARY
=======

When the Fast Throttle option is selected, throttle response is slowed rather
than sped up. (The Fast Throttle option is available by choosing Realism And
Reliability from the Sim menu.)

MORE INFORMATION
================

This will occur when using either the Cessna Skylane RG R182 or the Sopwith
Camel.

Do the following to reproduce this effect:

1. Start Flight Simulator 5.0.

2. If the startup situation is not Meigs Takeoff Runway 36, change to the Meigs
   Field situation by clicking Situations from the Options menu and clicking
   Meigs Field.

3. Press F4 to increase the throttle. Note the time it takes to increase to full
   throttle.

4. Cut the throttle by pressing F1, if your function keys are on top, or F10, if
   they are on the left.

5. From the Sim menu, click Realism And Reliability. Click the Fast Throttle
   check box to select it, and click OK.

6. Press F4 to increase the throttle. Note the time it takes to increase to full
   throttle.
