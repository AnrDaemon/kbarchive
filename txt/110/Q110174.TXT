TITLE   :WD97: Preserving Text When Re-protecting a Form Without Macros
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbualink97 kbdta kbfield word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a form with information entered in the fields is manually unprotected and
re-protected, the information is lost and the form fields are reset to their
default settings.

WORKAROUND
==========

Locking text form fields prior to protecting the form prevents the entered text
from being lost if the form is unprotected and re- protected. To lock a text
field, follow these steps:

1. Select the field.

2. Press CTRL+F11.

NOTE: If Help for WordPerfect Users is selected, CTRL+F11 will not function.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The information in text fields will not be lost when the document is protected
again, and the fields will function as usual while the form is being filled out
in protected mode.

WARNING: This workaround preserves only text fields. Check boxes and drop-down
list selections are still lost when you unprotect and re- protect the field. A
calculation field will no longer be updated and will maintain the current value
until unlocked, even if it is printed or if a macro is run to update it.
