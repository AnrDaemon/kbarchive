The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.1d 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Mail Network Administrator program in version 3.1d of Microsoft
Mail for AppleTalk Networks to move a user who belongs to a group whose name is
longer than 127 characters, the following error message will be displayed:

   <username> could not be added to the group: <groupname> A Server
   error occurred.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Move User utility cannot insert a user into a group definition with a name
whose length exceeds 127 characters. For successful insertion, manually add the
user to the group or shorten the group name to fewer than 127 characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.1d of Microsoft Mail
for AppleTalk Networks. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
