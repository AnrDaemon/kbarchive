TITLE   :WINSOCK API Init. Error: Not Enough DOS memory
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

When starting WinSock applications after other applications have started you get
the following error:

   WINSOCK API Initialization Error: Not enough DOS memory to allocate DOS
   buffers for all sockets.

CAUSE
=====

Windows uses a bottom-up memory allocation algorithm. If applications started
before WinSock applications exhaust all lower memory, WINSOCK.DLL cannot
initialize communication buffers in lower memory to talk to the TCP/IP protocol
stack, resulting in the above error message.

WORKAROUND
==========

Starting at least one WinSock application before any other applications allows
WINSOCK.DLL to reserve the lower memory buffers needed for communication with
the TCP/IP protocol stack and to retain them during subsequent memory
allocations.

Additional query words: 2.20 2.2 tcpip sockets
