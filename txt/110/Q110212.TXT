TITLE   :Repair Utility Fails if Computer Name is More Than 8 Characters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSPRESS Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows NT Resource Kit includes a utility, REPAIR.EXE, that lets you create
a new Emergency Repair Disk from current registry settings. If your computer
name is longer than eight characters, creating a new Emergency Repair Disk
fails.

Example
-------

REPAIR /s /x /nPRODUCT /pA:

This will override the default computer name with the name PRODUCT.

CAUSE
=====

The utility creates a directory using the computer name. Because the disk is
formatted as FAT, it does not accept a name longer than eight characters for a
directory name.

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid this problem, use the /n switch and specify an alternate name.
