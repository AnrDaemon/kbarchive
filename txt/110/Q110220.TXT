OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

When an OS/2 version 1.3 LAN Manager 2.2 server has more than 5000 users in its
NET.ACC, RASADMIN reports this error when you select users and permissions while
in the RASADMIN utility:

   Not enough memory or unable to load resource

You are prevented from adding users to RAS access.

CAUSE
=====

The RAS utility was not written to accommodate this many user accounts.

RESOLUTION
==========

CSD 01.005 has resolved hotsite escalation for this problem. This consists of an
MS-DOS and OS/2 RASUSER.EXE utility that can be run from command line. Just type
in RASUSER and it will show usage.

STATUS
======

Resolved.
