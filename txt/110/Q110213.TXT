TITLE   :HP 1200C PostScript Color Printer Prints Black-and-White
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

KEYWORDS:kbhw kbprint kbPrinting kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print from an Apple Macintosh with Windows NT Services for Macintosh
(SFM) to a shared PostScript color printer that does not have a Windows NT
driver and includes a PostScript Printer Definition (PPD) file, such as the
Hewlett-Packard (HP) DJ1200C, it prints in black-and-white or grayscale.

CAUSE
=====

The cause of this problem is that the Macintosh client queries the server for
information about the printer. If the printer being used is PostScript and has a
PPD file, the file is read for printer capabilities. However, if there is not a
corresponding PPD file, this prompts the server to return default information to
the Macintosh client. The default information returned is set up for a
black-and-white printer.

If you set up your printer with a non-PostScript driver, the Macintosh Services
checks the default non-PostScript device. The default is set to Color=False in
this device; therefore, you cannot work around this problem by setting up the
driver with a non-PostScript version for the same printer.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Advanced Server
version 3.1. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

The Hewlett-Packard product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
