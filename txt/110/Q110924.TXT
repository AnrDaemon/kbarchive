SYMPTOMS
========

Browsing in Windows for Workgroups 3.11 may not work if TCP/IP is the only
protocol installed.

CAUSE
=====

When TCP/IP is the only protocol installed, there is no Browse Master election.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

 - Increase NBSESSIONS in the [TCPIP] section of the PROTOCOL.INI file to 10.
   Add a setting called NUMNAMES to the [TCPIP] section of the PROTOCOL.INI file
   and set it to 11.

   -or-

 - Add the line MaintainServerList=YES to the [NETWORK] section of the
   SYSTEM.INI file.

   -or-

 - Use NetBEUI in conjunction with TCP/IP.
