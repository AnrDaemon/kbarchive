TITLE   :Hang on Reboot Autocheck of Stripe Set with Parity
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you restart after a system failure that caused data corruption, Microsoft
Windows NT Advanced Server stops responding (hangs) while autochecking a stripe
set with parity.

CAUSE
=====

When you reboot after a system failure, CHKDSK calls NTFS to search for data
corruption. When NTFS finds discrepancies in the redundant data, it attempts to
replace the bad sector with its redundant sector. The FTDISK driver calls the
SCSI driver to read the redundant sector, but Windows NT hangs because the SCSI
driver's asynchronous procedure call (APC) completion thread does not have
priority over the FTDISK driver synchronous thread waiting for the call to
return.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S.
Service Pack for Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1. For
