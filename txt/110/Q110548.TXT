SUMMARY
=======

The Full Screen External View option does not work for View 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Full Screen External View option, which is accessible when you click View
Options from the Views menu allows you to automatically switch to a full screen
view when View 1 is changed to one of the external view modes: Tower View or
Spot View.

Full Screen External View applies to View 1 only; when View 2 is toggled to an
external view, it will remain at its current size. To switch any view to full
screen, press the W key or click Maximize Window from the Views menu when the
desired view is active.
