SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word for Windows version 2.0 dialog boxes that list filenames, some
lines will be blank, indicating that files are being listed, but not displayed.
Also, some letters in words displayed on dialog boxes may be missing.

This behavior is intermittent and occurs when you start Word from a network
location (not from an installation of Word on the local computer) using an
account that does not have full privileges. This behavior does not occur when
you log on from an administrative account.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem was corrected in the latest U.S.
Service Pack for Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the
