TITLE   :PROFS: Bottleneck in MS-CSM Causes Multiple Requests
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The MS-CSM(Calendar Service Machine) goes into a looping, sends warning
messages, and sends a re-send request to the LAN for each out-of-sequence
free/busy distribution it receives from SCHDIST.EXE (from Microsoft Schedule+
for Windows).

The MS-CSM machine spends time and resources processing these requests, and this
has been known to cause the MS-CSM machine to go into a loop, depleting about
80% of the VM system resources.

The expected behavior would be for the MS-CSM machine to generate only one
re-send for the out of sequence distribution.

CAUSE
=====

MS-CSM cannot wait while a free/busy distribution is being processed by the
MS-CAL machine. Thus, if the next item in the MS-CSM machine's reader is a
distribution update, a warning message is generated. The previous message is
still being processed, which has delayed the MS-CSM machine from updating the
SCHDPLUS CONTROL file with the CONFIRMED flag.

RESOLUTION
==========

Halt the MS-CSM machine and purge all but one of the distributions, causing the
MS-CSM machine to generate only one re-send request.
