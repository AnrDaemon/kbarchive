TITLE   :Using MemMaker with EMM386.EXE Frame=None Parameter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the FRAME=NONE parameter is present on the EMM386.EXE device line in the
CONFIG.SYS file and you run MemMaker and answer "yes" to the question "Do you
use any programs that need expanded memory (EMS)?", MemMaker removes the RAM
parameter (if present) and adds the NOEMS parameter.

CAUSE
=====

The FRAME=NONE parameter is designed to provide Lotus-Intel-Microsoft version
4.0 Expanded Memory Specification (LIM 4.0 EMS) and to disable the 64-kilobyte
(K) page frame necessary for LIM 3.2 EMS. MemMaker is not aware of LIM 4.0 EMS
memory; therefore, if FRAME=NONE is specified, MemMaker assumes there is no page
frame, as with the NOEMS switch.

RESOLUTION
==========

Since MemMaker does not provide LIM 4.0 EMS, remove the FRAME=NONE parameter
from the EMM386.EXE device line in the CONFIG.SYS file prior to running
MemMaker. As MemMaker begins, answer "no" to the question "Do you use any
programs that need expanded memory (EMS)?" After MemMaker has finished, edit the
EMM386.EXE device line in CONFIG.SYS by replacing the NOEMS parameter with the
RAM parameter and adding FRAME=NONE. After rebooting, LIM 4.0 EMS should be
available.

Additional query words: 6.22 6.20 EMS
