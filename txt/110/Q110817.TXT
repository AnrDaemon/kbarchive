-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.1d 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Version 3.1d of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks may sometimes display an
asterisk (*) in the zone name field in a server-detected message.

Server-detected messages are generated by the server to the Network Manager when
a server that has not been seen before is placed on the network.

CAUSE
=====

This may occur for one of the following three reasons:

1. The server is not connected to an Apple Internet; therefore, no Internet
   routers exist. Routers provide zone information on an AppleTalk network.

2. When a new server, Server B, asks for the version of an existing server,
   Server A, then Server A also learns about the existence of Server B. Server A
   has a network address it can use to send mail to Server B, but it does not
   have the textual name of Server B's zone. Server A enters an asterisk (*) for
   the zone. The next time Server A does a full network scan, it will learn what
   zone Server B is in. The "*" zone is a temporary state that a new server
   might be in for a few hours until it is seen on a normal scan.

3. To determine the zone name of a new server, a Network Manager can use the
   Global Server Report option from the Mail Network Administrator program. Once
   the mail server has obtained full information about the new mail server, the
   zone information will be displayed.
