SUMMARY
=======

When opening a database file (.DBF), FoxPro checks the header for the following
five conditions that indicate corruption in a table:

1. Is the record length invalid?

    - Record length <= 1

    - Record length > maximum record length

2. Are there no fields?

3. Are there more fields than permitted?

4. Is the number of records < 0?

5. Is the file size invalid?

    - (Start-of-data + the # of records) * rec. length > file size

NOTE: Start-of-data is where the first byte of the first record begins.
