======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator for MS-DOS, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Flight Simulator 5.0, if you have Airframe Damage From Stress
turned on in the Sim/Realism And Reliability menu, the aircraft may explode
during normal operations (such as lowering flaps.)

MORE INFORMATION
================

Airframe damage from stress should occur when a stress that is beyond the
specified aircraft's performance envelope occurs.

This functionality is oversensitive in Flight Simulator 5.0; any stress applied
to the aircraft causes it to tear apart when this option is selected.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Flight Simulator version 5.0 for
MS-DOS. This problem was corrected in Flight Simulator version 5.0a.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start Flight Simulator 5.0.

2. While the aircraft is on the runway, click Realism And Reliability from the
   Sim menu.

3. Click Airframe Damage From Stress.

4. Apply 10 degrees down flaps. If your function keys are at the top of your
   keyboard press F6; if they are on the left side of the keyboard press F3.

At this point, the aircraft explodes even though no real stress has occurred.
This situation can occur at any point after Airframe Damage From Stress has been
selected.
