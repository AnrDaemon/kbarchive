======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.1d 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When configuring options with the Out of Office (OOF) form in version 3.1d of
Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, users have the option to specify an
expiration date for their OOF registration.

The field "Valid thru:" accepts a date specified in the MM/DD/YY format. By
entering a date in this field, the user can specify when the OOF server will
remove his or her registration from the OOF database.

The OOF server will process all mail according to configured options until
11:59:59 P.M. on the date specified in the "Valid thru:" field. At that time,
the OOF server will remove the user registration from the OOF server database
and will send a notification of the removal to the user[ASCII 146]s mail
account.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although the form specifies the date to be entered in MM/DD/YY format, it will
accept any valid Macintosh date entry. The OOF server will validate the entry
and, if the specified date is not considered valid, will reject the OOF
registration. For ease of configuration, Microsoft recommends dates be entered
in MM/DD/YY format.
