SUMMARY
=======

Although the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet III printer driver has a Page
Protection option in the Setup dialog box, it does not actually change the HP
printer configuration. This article explains how to change the Page Protection
setting and why the printer driver includes the option.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Online help for Page Protection states that the "printer's hardware must be
configured correctly." (To access online help, run Control Panel, choose
Printers, select the Page Protection check box, and then press F1.) Since there
are no software commands to set the Page Protection option on the HP LaserJet
III series printers, you must change the Page Protection option using the
control panel on the printer and then configure the printer driver.

Changing the printer driver setting allows Windows to subtract the amount of RAM
used for the Page Protection feature from the total amount of RAM available on
the printer. If this subtraction is not made, Windows may try to download too
much information to the printer, causing an out-of-memory error.
