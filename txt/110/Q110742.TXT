The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If several items that have been sent from other machines on the network are in
the Microsoft At Work PC Fax queue, and a fax is sent from the server, the
server blocks all faxes in the queue (regardless of priority) and sends the
local fax job. The faxes in the queue are sent after the local job is finished.

CAUSE
=====

The design of Microsoft At Work PC Fax does not balance the priority of faxes
sent from other machines on the network with faxes sent from the fax server.
Faxes sent from a fax server always have higher priority than faxes sent to the
server from other machines on the network.

Additional query words: 3.11 priority
