TITLE   :PC WSPlus: DefaultPrivateTask= Does Not Work as Documented
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In versions 1.0 and 1.0a of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, there is a
documented option in the Schedule+ "Administrator Guide" (page 29) that explains
the DefaultPrivateTask= option. The guide states that, by default, this option
sets all tasks created to private. The guide also states that setting this value
to zero allows the user to change that default to not private.

These comments in the "Administrator Guide" are both incorrect. By default, tasks
are created as not private. In addition, setting the DefaultPrivateTask=0 does
not change this default configuration.

RESOLUTION
==========

To set the task to private, the user must select the private box upon creation
of each task.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 1.0 and 1.0a of
Schedule+ for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: schedule plus 1.00 1.00a
