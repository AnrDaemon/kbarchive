TITLE   :SNA Server Service Stays Inactive When Started
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11,2.11 SP1,2.11 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsna211sp1 kbsna211sp2

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an SNA Server link service fails to start for any reason, the SNA Server
service will not start. Using SNA Server Admin, the server switches from Pending
to Inactive when it is started.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove any SNA Server link services that depend on
adapters that are not present, or determine why the SNA link service failed to
start. Possible causes for link service initialization failures include, but are
not limited to, the following:

 - Adapter not present in the machine.

 - Interrupt conflict with another device in the machine.

 - DLC driver not installed or bound to the network adapter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When SNA Server is installed, the SNA Server service is configured to depend on
all underlying link services to start. However, if an underlying link service
fails to start for any reason, SNA Server fails to start and the following error
will be logged in the Windows NT system log:

   Event ID: 7001
   Source: Service Control Manager
   Type: Error
   Description: The SnaServer service depends upon the <snalink> service
   which failed to start because of the following error:
   The dependency service or group failed to start.

Note that <snalink> is the name of the SNA Server link service specified
during SNA Server setup (default names are SnaSdlc1, SnaDlc1, SnaDft1, SnaX251).
This error occurs because the <snalink> service did not start. The reason
for the failure should be present in a preceding error in the system event log,
reported as Event ID #7000.

This no longer occurs with SNA Server versions 3.0 and later.
