SUMMARY
=======

You can programmatically determine the current video resolution by using the
SYSMETRIC() function. SYSMETRIC(1) returns the current screen width in pixels,
and SYSMETRIC(2) returns the current screen height in pixels. Combining these
two function calls will give the current video resolution.

Example
-------

      WAIT WINDOW "The Current Video Resolution is ";
         + LTRIM(STR(SYSMETRIC(1)))+ " X " + LTRIM(STR(SYSMETRIC(2)))
