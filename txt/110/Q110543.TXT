SUMMARY
=======

When using some scenery libraries, you may see dynamic scenery objects floating
in mid air.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This may occur when using the following scenery libraries:

 - Crop Duster World

 - Flight Simulator Aircraft & Scenery Designer version 4.0 Scenery Disk

 - Scenery files imported from Flight Simulator 4.0

 - Third-party scenery libraries

Dynamic scenery objects are loaded when dynamic scenery options are selected by
choosing Dynamic Scenery from the Scenery menu. If dynamic scenery elements are
selected, they are loaded regardless of the active scenery library.

Dynamic scenery objects are based on prerecorded patterns of movements, which
includes the elevation of the object. Therefore if the elevation Above Ground
Level(AGL) changes (due to a change in scenery library) the dynamic scenery
object will still play back in its original pattern at its original elevation.

Follow these steps to reproduce this effect:

1. Start Flight Simulator.

2. If a situation other than Meigs Takeoff Runway 36 is the startup situation,
   position the aircraft at Meigs Field by using the World menu's Airports
   command.

3. From the Scenery menu, click Dynamic Scenery and enable all dynamic scenery
   elements for View 1.

4. Set the View 1 dynamic scenery density to Very Dense and click OK.

5. Press the Y key on the keyboard to activate Slew mode. (In step 6, the AGL
   will drop 600 feet, Slew mode must be activated to prevent the aircraft from
   crashing.)

6. From the Scenery menu, click Scenery Library.

7. Click FS4 Scenery Disk, and click OK.

Notice fuel trucks and parked aircraft floating 600 feet above the new AGL.
