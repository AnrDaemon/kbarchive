SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Altitude Hold function (available by choosing Autopilot from
the Nav/Com menu), the hold elevation must be within 35,000 feet of the current
elevation.

If a hold elevation is specified more than 35,000 feet above or below the current
elevation, the autopilot will place the aircraft in a shallow dive. It will not
ascend or descend to the hold altitude.
