During Windows NT Setup, just after Setup restarts your computer, the
following error message may appear:

   Setup is unable to locate the hard drive partition prepared by the MS-DOS
   portion of setup.

Setup (WINNT.EXE) by default places temporary files on the first available
drive with enough free space, but because WINNT.EXE can see drives that
Windows NT may or may not support, sometimes these temporary files become
inaccessible to Setup. (Unsupported drives may be compressed drives,
unsupported SCSI drives, or drives on secondary IDE or ESDI controllers.)

To work around this problem, use the /T switch with the WINNT command. The
/T switch specifies the target drive to which temporary files will be
stored by Setup.
