SUMMARY
=======

The following article describes the general conventions and behavior for air
temperature in Flight Simulator 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Air temperature in Flight Simulator 5.0 is not affected by season or weather
conditions such as winds or clouds.

The air temperature is entirely governed by temperature layers established at
different altitudes by choosing Weather from the World menu and selecting
Temperature Layers.

Each layer contains information for the base altitude of the temperature layer
and the daytime temperature of the layer. Temperatures increase or decrease
proportionately as the aircraft ascends or descends based on the distance
between layers and the difference in temperatures of the layers.

For example, the closer layers are together, the more rapidly the temperature
must change as the aircraft moves from one layer to another. Also, the greater
the difference in temperatures between adjoining temperature layers, the more
rapidly the temperature changes as the aircraft ascends or descends.

Flight simulator has a maximum of four temperature layers per weather area.

The maximum allowable temperature range is between -139 to +167 degrees
Fahrenheit.
