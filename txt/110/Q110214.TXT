SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the REPAIR.EXE program that ships with the Windows NT Resource Kit
after installing a U.S. Service Pack, REPAIR.EXE detects that the files have
changed and tries to create an Emergency Repair Disk. When REPAIR.EXE attempts
to create the Emergency Repair Disk, an "out of disk space" error message
appears. The following command line generates this error message:

   Repair /s /x /pA:

WORKAROUND
==========

You can work around this problem by having REPAIR.EXE write information to
multiple disks by specifying the /c parameter in the command line. For example:

   Repair /s /x /c /pA:
