This occurs when using the Weather Generation At Startup option, which is
accessible by choosing General Preferences from the Options menu.

In most situations that ship with Flight Simulator 5.0 the base temperature at
zero ft Mean Sea Level (MSL) is set to 75 degrees Fahrenheit. When Weather
Generation At Startup is selected, the base temperature is raised to 100 degrees
Fahrenheit.

The Weather Generation At Startup was corrected in Flight Simulator 5.00a. In the
5.00a version it uses a random weather pattern.
