The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are executing an SQL-SELECT statement with a UNION clause and an ORDER
BY clause, the error message "SQL Invalid ORDER BY" is generated if the ORDER BY
clause references a field name.In Visual FoxPro,the error is "SQL: Order by
Clause is Invalid". For example, this error will occur if you type the following
SELECT statements in the Command window:

        SELECT * FROM customer ;
             UNION ;
        SELECT * FROM customer_a ORDER BY cno

CAUSE
=====

This error message is the correct response according to page L3-872 of the
"Language Reference."

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, replace the ORDER BY <character expression>
clause with an ORDER BY <numeric expression> clause, where the numeric
expression indicates the number of the column by which to order the output. Only
the final SELECT statement can have a ORDER BY clause.

The following example demonstrates the correct syntax:

       ** This example will order the output by the first output field
        SELECT * FROM customer ;
             UNION ;
        SELECT * FROM customer_a ORDER BY 1
