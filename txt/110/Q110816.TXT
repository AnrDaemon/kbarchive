TITLE   :Mac Wkst: Address Window Too Large for Color Classic
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For Appletalk Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1d
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.1d 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use version 3.1d of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks to address a
mail message using the standard addressing window, the right side of the dialog
box is cut off.

CAUSE
=====

The Macintosh Color Classic screen is slightly smaller than that of a Macintosh
SE by approximately 1/8 inch. Because of this size difference, the addressing
screen is not displayed in its entirety.

NOTE: This does not affect the function of the dialog box, only the display on
the Color Classic.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.1d of Microsoft Mail
for AppleTalk Networks. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 3.10d
