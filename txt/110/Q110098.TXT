======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you create a custom form using version 1.0 of the Microsoft Electronic
Forms Designer, data entered into a Masked Edit control will not automatically
be written to the MEF Package when the form is sent. The code to package and
unpackage data in a Masked Edit control is not included in the E-Forms toolkit.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can add code to the WriteTaggedControls and ReadTaggedControls functions so
the Masked Edit control is automatically included in the MEF Package. To do so,
perform the following steps:

1. Open your E-Form project in Visual Basic.

2. In the Project window, select EFORM.BAS.

3. In the Procedures drop-down list box, select WriteTaggedControls.

4. Scroll to the section of the code that is commented "'Add other custom
   controls here".

5. Add the following code directly below the comment:

         ElseIf TypeOf ctrl Is MaskEdBox Then
           MEFWriteText package, Tag, CStr(ctrl.Text)

6. From the Procedures drop-down list box, select ReadTaggedControls.

7. Scroll to the section of the code that is commented "'Add other custom
   controls here".

8. Add the following code directly below the comment:

      ElseIf TypeOf ctrl Is MaskEdBox Then
        ctrl.Text = MEFReadText(package, Tag, "")
