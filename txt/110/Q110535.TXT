TITLE   :PRB: Open Dialog Does Not Display Objects Without Extensions
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.5b,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.5b 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The FoxPro for Macintosh Open File dialog box does not display files that have
no extension, even if the file type matches the chosen file type.

CAUSE
=====

For consistency between platforms, the Open dialog box is based on file
extensions instead of file types.

RESOLUTION
==========

Either select the All Files check box to see files with no extensions, or do not
remove the extensions from your filenames.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. From the Apple Finder, remove the extension from a program's filename. For
   example, change TEST.PRG to TEST.

2. In FoxPro for Macintosh, choose Open from the File menu, select Program as
   the file type, and select the folder where the renamed program is stored.

The TEST file is not displayed until the All Files check box is selected. This
behavior holds true for all file types.
