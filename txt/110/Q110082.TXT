SYMPTOMS
========

If your monitor is initially set to something other than 256 colors, you may
find that after you run Art Gallery and restart your Macintosh, the monitor
resets to 256 shades of gray.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Art Gallery version 1.0 for the
Macintosh. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, use the Monitors control panel to set your system to
256 colors.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Open the Monitors control panel and choose 16 colors. Close the Monitors
   control panel.

2. Start Art Gallery. A dialog box appears informing you that Art Gallery looks
   best when your monitor is set to 256 colors. You are offered the choice to
   Quit, Switch Now, or Continue.

3. Choose Switch Now. Your monitor resets to 256 colors and the Art Gallery
   screen appears.

4. From the File menu, choose Quit.

5. Open the Monitors control panel again, and close it without changing any
   settings.

6. From the Special menu, choose Restart.

Your Macintosh restarts. The initial Apple logo appears in color, but when the
desktop and Finder reappear, the display is set to 256 shades of gray.
