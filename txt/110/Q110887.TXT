SUMMARY
=======

When Chip runs over a brown button near the middle right side of the maze in
level 49, a bear trap should release a paramecia. However, the paramecia is not
released, thereby allowing Chip to collect the computer chips without having to
dodge the pink balls.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In level 49 there are two separate areas where Chip must venture. In the first
area, Chip must collect 18 red keys to unlock 18 red doors. In the second area,
Chip must collect the 23 available computer chips before exiting through the
exit square.

While Chip is collecting the keys in the first area, a paramecia is moving
through a labyrinth. Once the paramecia nears the end of the first part of this
labyrinth, it runs over two green buttons. These green buttons open two sets of
walls harboring pink balls, which Chip must dodge to obtain all of the keys.
After the paramecia runs over the two green buttons, it is stopped by a bear
trap.

Once Chip gets the keys and opens all of the doors, he will venture into the
second area. In the beginning of the second area, Chip runs over a brown button
that releases the paramecia into the second part of the labyrinth. While Chip
collects the computer chips in the second area, the paramecia will pass over a
second set of green buttons, thus releasing a second set of pink balls, which
Chip will again have to dodge to obtain all of the computer chips.

However, when Chip runs over the brown button, the paramecia is not released from
the bear trap as expected. As a result, Chip will be able to collect all of the
computer chips without having to dodge the pink balls.
