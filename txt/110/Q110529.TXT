TITLE   :PRB: FoxPro for Mac Doesn't Unload Library Before Reloading It
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.5b,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.5b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Unlike in FoxPro for MS-DOS or FoxPro for Windows, a library (.MLB) can be
loaded multiple times in FoxPro for Macintosh. For example, if you issue the
following commands in the Command window

      SET LIBRARY TO foxtools
      SET LIBRARY TO foxtools ADDITIVE
      ? SET("LIBRARY")

"FOXTOOLS.MLB, FOXTOOLS.MLB" will be returned.

The DISPLAY STATUS command will now show two instances of FoxTools loaded and
will not unload the first instance before loading the second.

In FoxPro for MS-DOS or FoxPro for Windows, the first instance of the library
would be unloaded and the second instance would be loaded.

RESOLUTION
==========

Before reloading the library, use the RELEASE LIBRARY command to unload the
library first. For example, issue the following command before reloading the
FoxTools library:

      RELEASE LIBRARY foxtools
