PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.5x,2.6a,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5x, 2.6a 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The ADIR() function does not return "." and ".." when the D option is specified.

CAUSE
=====

The Macintosh file system does not support current folder notation (.) and
subfolder notation (..); therefore, they are not returned when this function is
executed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

In the Command window, type the following:

      =ADIR( myarray, "*.*", "D" )
      ? myarray(1, 1)

In FoxPro for Windows or FoxPro for DOS, "." will be returned. In FoxPro for
Macintosh, the first file or folder encountered will be returned.
