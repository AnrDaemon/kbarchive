TITLE   :BUG: SAVEIMAGE May Cause Error DX1020 in SVGA Display Modes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the SAVEIMAGE function in a high resolution Super VGA mode may produce the
following error during program execution:

   DOSXMSF : fatal error DX1020: unhandled exception: General protection fault;

CAUSE
=====

The error occurs when attempting to save regions close to the entire size of the
display. The exact region that causes the GP fault varies according to the
display adapter used.

RESOLUTION
==========

Select smaller regions of the display to save as Windows .BMP files. For
example, an entire screen could be stored in two .BMP files.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-
DOS.

This problem does not occur on FORTRAN PowerStation 32.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Compile and run the sample code on a PC with an ATI Graphics Ultra to generate
the following error on the second call to SAVEIMAGE:

Sample Code
-----------

   Compile options needed: none
         include 'fgraph.fi'
         include 'fgraph.fd'

         i= setvideomode($XRES16COLOR)
         i= saveimage('savimag1.bmp',0,0,1023,510)
         i= saveimage('savimag2.bmp',0,0,1023,511)
         end
