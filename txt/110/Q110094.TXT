TITLE   :PC Forms: Errors When Opening E-Forms Under Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,3.0,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you choose an E-form that was created using version 1.0 of the Microsoft
Electronic Forms Designer from the Browser application, you may receive one of
the following error messages:

   Another machine is already signed in with the username you have entered. Sign
   out from the other machine and try again.

   -or-

   MAPI_FAILURE

CAUSE
=====

The above errors may appear if you open the custom form from version 3.0 or 3.2
of the 16-bit Microsoft Mail for Windows client running under the Microsoft
Windows NT operating system. If the 16-bit MAPI.DLL file is not located in the
WINNT\SYSTEM32 directory, the search path will find the 32-bit MAPI.DLL file in
that directory and will attempt to open a second MAPI session.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, copy the MAPI.DLL file from the WINNT\SYSTEM directory
to the WINNT\SYSTEM32 directory. When an E-form is launched, it will find the
16-bit version of MAPI.DLL, which is the one that is used by the 16-bit Mail
client.
