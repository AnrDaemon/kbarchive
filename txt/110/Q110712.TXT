TITLE   :ScanDisk Err Msg on System with Hard Card: ScanDisk Found...

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

You receive the following error message when you run ScanDisk on a hard card:

   ScanDisk found physical damage on drive C: that it can not correct.
   ScanDisk cannot repair damaged cluster 2, because other damage to drive C:
   prevents it.

This error can occur immediately after you attempt to compress a hard card with
DoubleSpace. In this scenario, the compressed drive doesn't mount after
DoubleSpace reboots your system. When you try to manually mount the compressed
volume file (CVF), you receive an error message stating that DBLSPACE.000 is not
a valid CVF, and that you should run ScanDisk.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when you run ScanDisk on a hard card and the hard card
device driver is not loaded in memory. You can read data from many hard cards,
even when the device driver is not loaded; however, you cannot write data to the
hard cards.

NOTE: Under these circumstances, problems similar to those noted above also occur
if you run a third-party surface-scan program.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, load the hard card drivers prior to running ScanDisk.

If you have a DoubleSpace-compressed drive, the hard card drivers are probably
stored within the unmounted CVF. You can correct this problem by copying the
hard card device drivers from the hard card installation disks. For more
information, query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   " hard card and startup and compressed and dblspace " (without the quotation
   marks)
