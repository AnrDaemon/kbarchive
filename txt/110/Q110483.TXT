TITLE   :Directories Listed Many Times or Not at All on Mac. Volume
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you access a Macintosh volume on a Windows NT Advanced Server computer from
a Macintosh computer, sometimes you see multiple copies of your directory or you
do not see your directory at all. This problem occurs when under the following
conditions:

 - A main user directory is created with full control permissions granted to
   Everyone.

 - Each individual user is given a separate sub-directory with full control
   granted only to the Administrators group and the user.

 - More than 13 (roughly) users have similarly created directories.


WORKAROUND
==========

Use Macintosh file permissions to control file and directory access in similar
situations.

NOTE: You must use all Macintosh file permissions to resolve the problem. The
problem still occurs if you mix Windows NT and Macintosh file permissions.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Advanced Server
version 3.10. This problem was corrected in Windows NT Server version 3.5.
