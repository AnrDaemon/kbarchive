TITLE   :Print Manager Shows Hidden Printer Shares
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1 3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you access the Browse list for printer shares from Print Manager,
hidden printer shares are also listed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create a hidden share, add "$" to the end of the share name. For example,
"admin$" is a hidden share and "admin" is not.

This behavior occurs only with printer shares, and if you use the Net View
command on a server, the hidden printer shares are not listed.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a printer share with "$" at the end of share name. For example:

   Print1$

2. From another Windows NT machine, open Print Manager.

3. From the Printer menu, choose Connect To Printer.

4. From the Browse list, select your Domain.

5. Double-click the machine with the hidden shares.

The Browse list shows the hidden printer shares.

However, you can hide the whole NT Server from the browse list by using: Net
Config Server /Hidden: Yes
