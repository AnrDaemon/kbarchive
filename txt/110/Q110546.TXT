SUMMARY
=======

The Lear 35A compass center post obscures some of the messages displayed in the
View 1 window.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sizing View 1 or moving the compass center post allows you to see the messages
as they are displayed. For more information about moving and sizing windows, see
page 68 in the "Microsoft Flight Simulator Pilot's Handbook."

The Stall, Overspeed, and Slew messages are displayed in the lower- right corner
of the View 1 window. There are two components to the Lear 35A instrument panel:
the main panel and the compass center post. When all windows are in their
default locations, the compass center post completely obscures any messages
displayed in the lower-right corner of the View 1 window.
