KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.5b 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The command-line switches supported in FoxPro for Windows and FoxPro for MS- DOS
are not supported in FoxPro for Macintosh.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Since the Macintosh environment does not allow the use of command-line switches,
the following switches are not supported in FoxPro for Macintosh:

   -C = Specify configuration file
   -E = Prevent use of all expanded memory
   -K = Prevent attempts to use F11 or F12
   -T = Suppress FoxPro sign-on screen

RESOLUTION
==========

To emulate the -C switch, double-click the CONFIG.FPM file that is desired.
FoxPro will then execute and use that configuration file.

The -E and -K switches are not needed in the Macintosh environment.

The -T switch is no longer supported by FoxPro for Macintosh. However, it is
still supported by FoxPro for Windows & FoxPro for MS-DOS.
