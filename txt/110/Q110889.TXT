KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot successfully load the secondary operating system (MS-DOS) from Boot
Loader on an Olivetti M6 series computer if you are booting from a SCSI hard
disk drive connected to an Adaptec 154X controller. The following error message
appears:

   Non-system disk or disk error.

If you boot from the onboard IDE controller or any other hardware configuration,
this problem does not occur.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by the specific interaction between the Olivetti M6
series computer and the Adaptec 154X controller.


WORKAROUND
==========

You can use a bootable floppy disk to avoid using Boot Loader in one of the
following two ways:

1. Boot from a bootable MS-DOS disk when you want to use MS-DOS.

2. Boot from a bootable MS-DOS disk. Use the SYS command to change the boot
   sector from the Windows NT Boot Loader to MS-DOS. When you want to return to
   Windows NT, boot with the Windows NT setup disk. Choose R for repair. After
   you insert the Emergency Repair disk, choose only to verify boot files on
   drive C.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Advanced Server
version 3.1. This problem has been corrected in Windows NT Server version 3.5.
