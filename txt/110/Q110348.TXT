TITLE   :Show Domain Members Only Option has Dimmed Icons
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.1,3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Page 440 of the Windows NT Advanced Server "System Guide" incorrectly states:

   "If a computer does not support remote administration, or if it is
   unavailable to the network (for example, if it is turned off), its icon
   is dimmed, and the version number and description are absent."

When you select the "View/Show Domain Members Only" option in Server Manager For
Domains, all machines shown are dimmed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design.
