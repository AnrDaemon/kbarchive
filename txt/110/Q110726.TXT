Name Finder Fails If Space Before Name
--------------------------------------

   Q95731

 
In version 3.0 or 3.0b of Microsoft Mail for Windows, if the friendly name
is defined as [space]Name or [space]LastName,[space]FirstName, the name
appears at the top of the address list, but using Name Finder to search for
that name fails.

Extended Characters Not Supported in .MMF Filename
--------------------------------------------------

   Q104029

Extended characters are not supported in .MMF filenames in the following
areas of versions 3.0 and 3.0b of Microsoft Mail for Windows:
 

 - The Backup command on the Mail menu.

 - The Open Message File dialog box. (You can enter an .MMF filename with
   extended characters, or select an .MMF filename with extended characters from
   the list box, but Mail cannot open the .MMF file.)

 - Mail invoked with the /f parameter (that is, MSMAIL /F NAME.MMF, where
   NAME.MMF is a filename with extended characters). In this case, Mail cannot
   open the .MMF file.

GP Fault During Setup When Installing Only Spelling
---------------------------------------------------

   Q104106

If you specify the Custom Install option during the Setup process of
version 3.0 or 3.0b of Microsoft Mail for Windows, and you choose to
install only the spelling drivers, the following error occurs:

   Could not open the file named: C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\TRNSCHED.DLL
   Choose Abort and click Yes to exit. Re-run SETUP.EXE.

 
This error results in a general protection (GP) fault in MSCOMSTF.DLL
@002D:001A.
 
 

Import/Export Does Not Work with Extended Characters
----------------------------------------------------

   Q104130

Version 3.0b of Microsoft Mail for Windows does not correctly import
or export a folder with an extended character (such as the letter O
with two dots above it) in the filename. The folder appears to be saved
correctly, but the filename is not converted properly.

Send Mail Command Doesn't Support Extended Characters
-----------------------------------------------------

   Q104134

Versions 3.0 and 3.0b of Microsoft Mail for Windows do not support sending
files with extended characters in the filename through the Windows 3.0 or
3.1 File Manager.

Failure to Connect to SHARED.INI Skips MSMAIL.INI
-------------------------------------------------

   Q105961

In versions 3.0 and 3.0b of Microsoft Mail for Windows, if you start
up Mail offline (not on the network) with the Mail message file (MMF)
stored locally, no shared extensions commands are available if the
SHARED.INI file cannot be found.

Err Msg: Mail System Error. Mail Could Not Read...
--------------------------------------------------

   Q107756

In versions 3.0 and 3.0b of Microsoft Mail for Windows, you may receive an
unreadable message. The header information is correct (To: From: and
Subject: fields) but the text indicates a MAIL SYSTEM ERROR. The error
message states:

   Mail could not read the entire message from the postoffice. Some parts of the
   message may be missing. Ask the sender to resend the message.
