 - Microsoft Mail Post Office Diagnostics Utility, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Postoffice Diagnostics Utility (PODIAG.EXE) has
several command-line parameters you can enter on the Program Manager File Run
menu. You can also add these command-line options to the command- line
properties of the PODIAG icon. The following is an example of the command-line
properties that will automatically log the administrator in to a postoffice
mapped to drive M while logging the information to a local log file:

   c:\podiag\podiag.exe -dm:\maildata admin -ppassword

                        -lc:\podiag.log -r -a

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is a complete list of all of the command-line options and their
descriptions.

admin
-----

The mailbox of the postoffice administrator. This option is used in conjunction
with the -ppassword option.

-d<path>
--------

The letter of the network drive where the postoffice data files are located, if
it is not the current drive. If you do not specify a path, the diagnostics
utility assumes that the postoffice is in the current directory on the specified
drive.

For example, if the data files are in the current directory on drive M, and the
Diagnostics utility is in the PODIAG directory on drive C, you start the
Diagnostics utility by typing the following line, where the mailbox name used to
sign in is admin:

   c:\podiag.exe admin -dm

If the postoffice directory is not the current directory on the drive, you need
to specify the path. For example, if the postoffice is in the MAILDATA directory
on drive M, type the following line:

   c:\podiag.exe admin -dm:\maildata

The -d command-line parameter can be used in conjunction with the PODIAG.INI
Login= and Password= settings.

-l<logfilename> (Log File Option)
---------------------------------

Specifies the log file location and filename. For example:

   -ldiaglog.log

-p<password> (Password Option)
------------------------------

The password of the mailbox name used to start the diagnostics utility. If you do
not specify a password, you are required to do so on the Sign In screen.

-r (Batch Run Option)
---------------------

Runs all tools automatically on a postoffice. To run tools automatically, you
must specify the administrator mailbox name, the -p<password> option, and
the -d<drive letter> option.
