======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When installing, running, or printing from WordPerfect 6.0 for Windows under
Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11, you may receive the following
error

   Cannot find <entry>.DRV

where <entry> is the text referenced on the Multinet= line in the [Network]
section of the SYSTEM.INI file. Two common entries are NONET.DRV and
NETWARE3.DRV.


CAUSE
=====

This error is referencing a file that does not exist. During the installation of
WordPerfect 6.0 for Windows, the setup program reads the Multinet= entry and
looks for a .DRV file whose name reflects the entry. Since no such file exists,
the above error is generated.

Default installations of Windows for Workgroups contain a Multinet=NONET entry;
therefore, the most common occurrence of the error will be as follows:

   Cannot find NONET.DRV.

If you ignore the error during installation, it will reoccur each time you start
WordPerfect 6.0.

WORKAROUND
==========

At an MS-DOS command prompt, you can create a zero-byte file to match the
Multinet= entry by using the following syntax

      Cannot find <entry>.DRV

where <entry> matches the filename referenced in the error message. This
generates a "File not found - AAA" error, which can be ignored.

Move the newly created <entry>.DRV file to the Windows SYSTEM
subdirectory.
This prevents the error message from occurring.

For more information concerning this error, contact WordPerfect Technical
Support.
