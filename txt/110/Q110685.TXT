The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) printer connected to a 16 Mbps token
ring network using an HP Jet Direct card, all print jobs may not print. Some
print jobs may print okay, and others may not print at all. It is possible that
no error message is displayed, but the printer fails to print. Other
intermittent printing problems may also occur.

CAUSE
=====

According to HP Technical Support, intermittent printing problems can occur when
using certain HP Jet Direct cards on a 16 Mbps token ring network because only
the newer cards (for example, the Jet Direct cards designed for the HP LaserJet
IV printers) are supported at that data rate. Older Jet Direct cards (cards for
the HP LaserJet IIIs), are not supported by HP at 16 Mbps. This problem is not
specific to Windows NT.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you are using an older HP Jet Direct card and are experiencing intermittent
problems, lower the token ring speed to 4 Mbps. If you are using one of the
newer cards that is supported at 16 Mbps, make sure that you are using either
Type 1 cabling or a Type 3 media filter. These media requirements must be met in
order for the card to be supported at the higher token ring data rate. For
additional information, call HP Technical Support at (208) 323-2551.
