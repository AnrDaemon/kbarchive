 - Microsoft Flight Simulator for MS-DOS, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Moving or sizing a window with the mouse causes a "smearing" effect and the
window remains partially drawn at whatever location it has traversed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When sizing or moving a window with the mouse, a complete redraw does not occur
until the action is completed.

Follow these steps to reproduce this effect:

1. Start Flight Simulator 5.0.

2. Position the mouse cursor in the lower-right corner of view 1.

3. Click and hold down the left mouse button.

4. Drag the cursor up and to the left. Note that the window remains partially
   drawn at its original location.

5. Release the left mouse button. Note that the View 1 window now redraws
   completely.
