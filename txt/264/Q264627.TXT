======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Windows NT-based Systems Management Server (SMS) client computers that
use the SMS Video Acceleration driver to improve Remote Control performance may
experience a Kernel-mode "Stop 1e" exception in the video driver. The error
message may be similar to:

   STOP: 0x0000001e (0xc0000005, 0xfcbd2f36, 0x00000000, 0x0000008d)
   KMODE Exception Not Handled in ATI.DLL

This exception occurs only on computers on which the Microsoft NetMeeting display
driver is installed. This driver is installed when the sharing features in
NetMeeting are enabled.

This exception occurs in response to any of the following actions:

 - Attempting to start NetMeeting.

 - Attempting to use an OpenGL-based screen saver.

 - Attempting to use Remote Control on the computer.

 - If a program directly or indirectly queries the DirectDraw capabilities of
   the video driver.


CAUSE
=====

The exception is caused by an improper driver interaction among the SMS Video
Acceleration driver, the NetMeeting display driver, and the video adapter driver
that is installed on the computer. During this interaction, the SMS Video
Acceleration driver may send incorrect data to the video adapter driver. The
hotfix that is described in this article includes a new SMS Video Acceleration
driver (Idisntkm.dll) that corrects this issue.
