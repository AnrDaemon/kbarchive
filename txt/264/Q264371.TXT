TITLE   :Viacompact Tool Deletes X500.db File Unexpectedly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg metadirectory Zoomit MMS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Viacompact without the -unattended command-line option and the
"Restart server when done" check box is selected in the Advanced Options dialog
box, Viacompact does not release its locks on all database files until you
respond to a final dialog box (the final dialog box informs you that the
compaction is finished and prompts you to click OK).

If you start a second instance of Viacompact using the -unattended and -start
command-line options, Viacompact attempts to rename the X500.db file to X500.sav
and the following error message is displayed in the log and on the console:

   Failed to delete (.........)\hashwild.db; error 13 (Permission denied)

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the first instance of Viacompact is not completely
finished. The X500.save file already exists and the rename operation is
unsuccessful. The subsequent deletion of the X500.db file (part of the normal
Viacompact process) results in the database losing its (fundamental) ASN.1
database, which effectively wipes out the entire directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this situation, ensure that all previous instances of Viacompact are
completely finished before you start a new instance.
