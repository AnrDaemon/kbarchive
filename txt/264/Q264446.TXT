KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you upgrade from Exchange Server 5.5, the default installation folder is
not changed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior can be confusing because the default installation folder for a new
installation of Exchange 2000 Server is %SystemRoot%\Program Files\Exchsrvr. If
you installed Exchange Server 5.5 to %SystemRoot%\Exchsrvr, after you upgrade to
Exchange 2000, the installation folder is not changed.
