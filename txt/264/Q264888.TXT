The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform a mail merge in Microsoft Word 97 and send the results to
electronic mail (e-mail), you receive the following warning:

   A program is trying to access e-mail addresses you have stored in Outlook. Do
   you want to allow this?

   If this is unexpected, it may be a virus and you should choose "No".

If you click Yes, you receive the following warning:

   A program is trying to automatically send e-mail on your behalf. Do you want
   to allow this?

   If this is unexpected, it may be a virus and you should choose "No"."

NOTE: This behavior occurs whether you are running Microsoft Outlook in Internet
Mode Only (IMO) or in Corporate Workgroup (CW) mode.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if you have installed the Outlook E-mail Security Update.
The Outlook E-mail Security Update provides additional levels of protection
against malicious e-mail messages. The update changes the way that Outlook
handles attachments and the way that Outlook can be controlled
programmatically.

For additional information about this update, please see one of the following
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base, depending on which version of Outlook
you have:

This behavior of the Microsoft Word Mail Merge to E-mail feature is by design
when the Outlook E-Mail Security Update is installed.
