SUMMARY
=======

When you debug a Windows NT-based server with a kernel debugger, it is
frequently necessary to obtain the checksum value for a driver. This article
describes how to find the checksum value for a driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can obtain the checksum value through the kernel debugger by taking the base
address of the driver and looking at offset 0xd8:

1. To find the base address of the driver or executable file for which you are
   interested in obtaining the checksum, use the !drivers command. Output
   similar to the following example is displayed:

   0: kd> !drivers
   !drivers
   Loaded System Driver Summary
   Base      Code Size        Data Size       Driver Name  Creation     Time
   f78f4000  3afe0 ( 235 kb)  5c40 (  23 kb)  rdr.sys      Thu Sep 23   06:09:18 1999

NOTE: In this example the base address for the Rdr.sys file is at 0xf78f4000.

2. Add the offset 0xd8 to find the address of the checksum field in the driver's
   image header:

   0: kd> dd f78f4000+d8 l1
   dd f78f4000+0xd8 l1
   f78f40d8  000497ae

NOTE: The checksum value in this example is 0x497ae for the Rdr.sys file.
To obtain the checksum of a dynamic-link library (DLL), use the !dlls -a command
to display all image header information (which includes the checksum value).
