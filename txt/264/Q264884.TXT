======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Video Acceleration feature for Microsoft Windows 2000-based clients is not
supported in versions of Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 prior to Service
Pack 3 (SP3). Therefore, remotely controlling a Windows 2000-based client may be
two to six times slower than a similar Remote Control session on a Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0-based clients.

CAUSE
=====

The slow performance occurs because there is no video acceleration capability
for Windows 2000-based clients in the SMS Remote Control video drivers, which
are used to transfer the video during a Remote Control session.

The slow video performance during a Remote Control session is not an indication
of poor performance of Windows 2000.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article

listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
