SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 ATL Object wizard to create a Full
control, the Ready State property is not listed on the Stock Properties tab.

RESOLUTION
==========

To manually add the ReadyState property to the control, perform the following
steps:

1. Add the following code to the interface definition in the control's Interface
   Definition Language (IDL) file:

   interface IMyControl : IDispatch
   {
   ...
      [propput, id(DISPID_READYSTATE)]
      HRESULT ReadyState([in]long state);
      [propget, id(DISPID_READYSTATE)]
      HRESULT ReadyState([out, retval]long* pstate);
   ...
   };

2. Add the following code to the BEGIN_PROP_MAP definition in the control's
   header (.h) file:

   BEGIN_PROP_MAP(CMyControl)
   ...
      PROP_ENTRY("ReadyState", DISPID_READYSTATE, CLSID_NULL)
   ...
   END_PROP_MAP()

3. Add the following member variable to the control class definition in the
   control's header (.h) file:

   LONG m_nReadyState;
