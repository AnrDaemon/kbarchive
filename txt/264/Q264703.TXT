TITLE   :SMS:Queries Missing During Collection Creation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0, if you want to create a new
collection based on a query membership rule, you can use the Browse button in
the Query Rule Properties window to import available queries. However, not all
queries listed under the queries object in the SMS administrator console are
displayed in the Browse Query window.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior occurs because the Browse Query window only displays queries based
on the resource class or object type (for example, System Resource, User Group
Resource or User Resource).

In addition, queries that contain prompted value statements are not displayed as
a collection. This kind of query would prompt the user for input at every
collection update interval.


Additional query words: prodsms disappear
