TITLE   :SMTP: Access Component Determines SMTP Gateway Already Installed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.0,3.x; WINDOWS:3.2,3.2a,3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.2a, 3.5 
 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, versions 3.0, 3.x 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After a user runs the install -r command on an MS Mail postoffice from the SMTP
access component disk or the SMTP gateway disk to remove the access component or
gateway, if the user attempts to reinstall the access component or gateway, the
installation process may determine (incorrectly) that the access component or
gateway is already installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

When a user runs the install -r command, two files are modified on the MS Mail
postoffice: the Master.glb and Network.glb files. The install -r command may not
remove the access component or gateway completely. The user must send the Glb
folder to Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS) so that PSS can modify the
Glb folder.
