SYMPTOMS
========

After you configure the Citrix UNIX Integration Service, you may be unable to
start the Citrix Installer Service. Also, you may be unable to change your
domain password.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this issue:

1. Start Regedt32.exe, and then view the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\system\currentcontrolset\control\lsa\authentication
   packages

2. The "authentication packages" are set to the UNIX Integration Service,
   "fmjauth" (the default is msv1_0). Remove fmjauth, and then add msv1_0. This
   works correctly if you do not need this type of authentication.
