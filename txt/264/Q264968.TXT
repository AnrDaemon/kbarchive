TITLE   :Files without Extensions are Mapped to Application/Octet-Stream
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When IIS locates a file that does not have an extension, the Content-Type that
is sent back to the browser is set to application/octet-stream. There is no way
to change this behavior in the user interface. The AOL Netscape browser does not
display the file because of this header setting. Instead, it tries to download
the file.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Editing the metabase incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall any product that uses the metabase. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from incorrectly editing the metabase can be
solved. Edit the metabase at your own risk.

NOTE: You should always back up the metabase before you edit it.

To resolve this problem, do the following:

1. Install the IIS Resource Kit.

2. Run the Setup program to install MetaEdit.

3. Start MetaEdit, open the LM tree in the left hand pane, and then open the
   MimeMap folder.

4. In the right pane, double-click ID 6015 MimeMap.

5. In the Data list box, scroll down (about half way) until you find
   .*,application/octet-stream.

6. Change the value to .*,text/html.

7. Click OK, and then close MetaEdit.

8. Open a command window so that you can stop and restart IIS.

9. Type the following command at a command prompt:

   net stop iisadmin /y

10. Type the following command at a command prompt:

   net start w3svc

WORKAROUND
==========

Add an extension to the file.

STATUS
======

This is by design.
