TITLE   :Client Add Pack Does Not Recognize Small Business Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0,4.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server versions 4.0, 4.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing Small Business Server 4.0 (SBS) on a computer running
Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0, and you try to install the Client Add Pack, you
may not be able to do so and you may receive the following error message:

   Your computer is not running Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server. You
   can only add licenses to a computer running Small Business Server.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. You cannot install the SBS Client Add Pack on a
Windows NT Server 4.0 that was not initially installed as an SBS Server.


RESOLUTION
==========

If the SBS install was converted to full Windows NT Server, you cannot apply
additional SBS Client Add Packs. You can only install SBS Client Add Pack on a
valid SBS Server.
