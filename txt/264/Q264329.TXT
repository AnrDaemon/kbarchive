KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5

SYMPTOMS
========

The Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA) may stop transferring messages
through all X.400 connectors that use a X.25 Winsock stack, even if those
connectors are available.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if multiple (two or more) X.25 Winsock stacks are
configured and one link is down. When the X.25 Winsock driver returns an error
to the MTA listen call, both links may stop transferring data.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
