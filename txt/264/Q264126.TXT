TITLE   :XADM: Cannot Send SSL Messages After Installing Certificate
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you obtain a new certificate from a Microsoft Windows 2000 certification
authority (CA), the organization name, common name, and other values specified
in the certificate request may not appear in the certificate's properties. In
addition, if you install the certificate, commit the changes, and then attempt
to send messages using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) authentication, the Exchange
Server computer may not be able to establish the SSL connection.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the Windows 2000 certification authority issues the
certificate using base-64 encoding instead of binary encoding. The Key Manager
program (Keyring.exe) that is used to install certificates on an Exchange Server
computer does not support base-64-encoded certificates.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, convert the base-64-encoded certificate you
obtained from the Windows 2000 certification authority to use binary encoding
instead.
