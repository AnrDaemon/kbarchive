SUMMARY
=======

To change a registry value or registry permissions from a command line or from a
script, use the Regini.exe utility that is included in the Windows NT Server 4.0
Resource Kit.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The syntax for changing registry values or permissions with Regini is:

REGINI [-m \\machinename] files

where the -m \\machinename option is used to modify the registry of a remote
machine, and files represents the names of the script files that contain the
changes to the registry.

The text file or files should contain the registry changes in the following
format:

\Registry\Hiveroot\Subkeys registry value=data [permissions]

The Regini utility works with kernel registry strings. When you gain access to
the registry in User mode with HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, HKEY_CURRENT_USER, and so on,
the string is converted in Kernel mode as follows:

 - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE is converted to \registry\machine.

 - HKEY_USERS is converted to \registry\user.

 - HKEY_CURRENT_USER is converted to \registry\user\user_sid, where user_sid is
   the Security ID associated with the user.

 - HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT is converted to \registry\machine\software\classes.

For example, a script file to change the registry value DiskSpaceThreshold
located in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive to the value 0x00000000 would be written
as follows:

\registry\machine\system\currentcontrolset\services\lanmanserver\parameters
DiskSpaceThreshhold = REG_DWORD 0x00000000

Registry key permissions are specified by binary numbers separated by spaces,
corresponding to Regini.doc file numbers that specify certain permissions given
to specific groups. (For example, the number 1 specifies Administrators - Full
Control). You can use the Resource Kit utility REGDMP to get the current
permissions of a registry key in the binary number format.

CAUTION: When you use Regini to change permissions, the current permissions are
replaced, not edited.

The following example script file shows the syntax for changing permissions on a
registry key:

\Registry\Machine\Software [1 5 10]

This script modifies HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software to have the permissions:

Administrators - Full Control
Creator/Owner - Full Control
Everyone - Read

For more information, refer to the Regini.doc file that is included in the
Windows NT Server 4.0 Resource Kit.
