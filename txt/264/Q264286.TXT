======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.2a, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an MS Mail postoffice is converted to an Exchange Server postoffice, the
converted Exchange Server postoffice may not be displayed in the global address
list of other MS Mail postoffices. The recipients in the converted Exchange
Server postoffice are displayed in the Exchange Server Administrator program.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, click the requestor object for
   an MS Mail postoffice that has a global address list in which the converted
   (from MS Mail) Exchange Server posoffice is not displayed.

2. Open the requestor object properties, click the Export Containers tab, and
   then select the appropriate site in the Site list.

3. On the Export Containers tab, select the Recipients container under Recipient
   Containers, and then click Add to add it under "Export these recipients".

   NOTE: If multiple MS Mail postoffices have a global address list in which the
   converted (from MS Mail) Exchange Server posoffice is not displayed, perform
   steps 1 through 3 for the requestor objects for all of these MS Mail
   postoffices.

4. In MS Mail, check the System.mbg file to make sure that it is updating.

5. On the Exchange Server hub postoffice, check the Recipients container. Make
   sure that the Recipients container contains addresses for the converted
   Exchange Server postoffice and that the Recipients container is displayed
   under "Export these recipients" on the Export Containers tab (to be exported
   to MS Mail).

6. In MS Mail, run the Netdump utility to make sure that the Exchange Server
   postoffice .usr file exists.

   The following is a sample of the netdump command line:

   NETDUMP admin [-D[d|path]] [-Ffilename] [-Llogfile] -Ppassword

   Check the third column from the left for the postoffice Mailbag, which has the
   same hexadecimal ID (hexid) as the .usr file. Check for the same hexid in the
   Usr directory on the MS Mail postoffices.

7. Empty the Dxadata directory.

8. Stop and restart the Directory Synchronization Service (DXA).

9. Make sure that the amount of disk space available on the hard disk is equal
   to or greater than the size of the Xdir.edb file multiplied by 4.

10. Manually synchronize the directories.
