SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to individually control engines when you use a
multiple engine aircraft in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Flight Simulator 2000, you control all of the engines on an aircraft by
default. If you want to control a particular engine, you can give that engine
the control or focus by pressing the following key combination

   E+x

where x is a number (1 through 4) that indicates the engine that you want to
control.

If you set the focus to control one engine and you want to control more than one
engine, press and hold down the E key while you press the number key for each
engine that you want to control.

For example, if you want to control both engines on a two-engine aircraft, press
the following key combination:

   E+1,2
