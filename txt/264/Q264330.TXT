TITLE   :XFOR: Internet Mail Service Relays Messages Despite Restrictions
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Exchange Server 5.5 Internet Mail Service may relay messages if the messages
are sent to a specific encapsulated addressing format.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the message is sent to a server that is using one domain
(for example, domain1) that is set to "forward all messages" to another domain
(for example, domain2). The "forward all messages" option is set on the
Connections tab. The server is also configured to reroute inbound SMTP mail (set
on the Routing tab), has the routing restriction for "Hosts and clients that
successfully authenticate" selected, and is configured to accept mail from
"localdomain.com". The message is in the following format:

   "IMCEA user@domain2.com" @localdomain1.com

This format implies that this user does exist on domain2 and that domain1 has
site addressing set to localdomain1.com.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
