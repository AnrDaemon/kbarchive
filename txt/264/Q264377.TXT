The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, versions 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows Services for UNIX (SFU) versions 2.0 and 3.0 support two-way password
synchronization with Solaris version 7.0. SFU supports only Windows to UNIX
password synchronization in Solaris version 2.6. However, the included daemons
only run on the Sparc platform.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows SFU 2.0 and 3.0 include a Single Sign On daemon (SSOD) and a Password
Authentication module (PAM) for several versions of UNIX. These daemons allow
password synchronization for Windows and UNIX user accounts. The files for
Solaris are:

   ssod.so7 - Windows to UNIX component.
   Pam_sso.so7 - UNIX to Windows component

These daemons have been compiled to run on the Sparc platform only. Therefore,
password synchronization with a Solaris 7 system on an Intel-based computer does
not work.
