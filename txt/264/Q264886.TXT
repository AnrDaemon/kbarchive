In Direct Mail Manager, when you click Outlook Folders in the Locate List dialog
box, you receive the following warning:

   A program is trying to access e-mail addresses you have stored in Outlook. Do
   you want to allow this?

   If this is unexpected, it may be a virus and you should choose "No".

When you click OK, your Outlook folders are displayed.

This behavior occurs if you have installed the Outlook E-mail Security Update.
