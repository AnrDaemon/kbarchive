The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you establish a two-way trust relationship between two Windows NT 4.0
domains, an Administrator from one domain can view the list of users in the
other domain from User Manager for Domains. However, when you use the
Administrator user account and attempt to open the properties of a user in the
other domain, the following error message may appear:

   "The following error occurred while accessing the properties of the user
   (username): access is denied. User properties cannot be viewed or edited at
   this time."

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the Administrator user account is not a member of
the local Administrators group in the other domain.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, add the Administrator user account to the local
Administrators group in the trusted domain.
