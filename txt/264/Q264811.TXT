======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0, when you print a large Network
Monitor capture to a file that contains more than 5,400 frames, the timestamps
associated with each frame are reset to 0 (zero) seconds after the fifty-four
hundredth frame is spooled to the target print file. The timestamp continues
forward from 0 after being reset. The original capture retains the correct
frame-to-timestamp association.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
