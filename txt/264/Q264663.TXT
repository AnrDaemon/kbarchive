the desktop under the LocalSystem account. If the service is configured to
interact with the desktop, you cannot change the service to run under a domain
user account.

the quotation marks)

MORE INFORMATION
================

SC.exe is a command line utility that is included in the Microsoft Windows NT
Server 4.0 Resource Kit and the Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit. SC.exe
implements calls to all of the Windows NT service control application
programming interface (API) functions. It allows you to set the parameters to
these functions by specifying them on the command line. You can use SC.exe to
display service status and to retrieve the values stored in the status structure
fields, providing more detailed and accurate information about services than you
receive through the end-user utilities provided with the Windows NT 4.0
operating system.

For a complete description of the use and capabilities of the SC.exe utility,
refer to the file Sc-dev.txt, which is included in the Windows NT Server 4.0
