-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW) to deploy an Internet
Information Server (IIS) application to a Web server, you receive the following
error message:

   Unexpected error number C0042116 has occurred: The Web server returned the
   following error: There was a problem installing CAB x.CAB. Please check it
   and the INF x.INF for validity.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because the Scripts virtual directory is configured to run
under Microsoft Transaction Server and Microsoft Component Object Model
(MTS/COM+), and the Identity of the MTS/COM+ package does not have sufficient
rights to install the CAB file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Internet Information Server 4.0:

To resolve this problem in IIS 4.0, set the Scripts virtual directory to run
in-process as follows:

1. Start the Internet Service Manager. To do this, click Start, select Program
   Files, and then select Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack. Select Microsoft Internet
   Information Server, and then select Internet Service Manager.

2. Expand the Internet Information Server node in the left pane to reveal the
   available computers.

3. Expand the computer name in the left pane to reveal the available Web sites.

4. Expand the Web site to which you are attempting to deploy your application.
   This reveals the available virtual directories.

5. Right-click the Scripts virtual directory, and select Properties.

6. On the virtual directory, clear the Run in separate memory space check box.

Internet Information Services 5.0:

To resolve this problem in IIS 5.0, set the Application Protection in the Scripts
virtual directory as follows:

1. On a Windows-2000 based computer, click Start, and then select Programs.
   Point to Administrative Tools, and then click Internet Services Manager.

2. Expand the computer name in the left pane to reveal the available Web sites.

3. Expand the Web site to which you are attempting to deploy your application.
   This reveals the available virtual directories.

4. Right-click the Scripts virtual directory, and select Properties.

5. In the Scripts virtual directory, set the Application Protection to either
   Low(IIS Process) or High(Isolated).

   NOTE: If you set the Application Protection to run as a High (Isolated)
   process, you should configure the Identity of the COM+ package to run under
   an account that has Administrative rights.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because the Posting Acceptor (Cpshost.dll) calls the RevertToSelf API before it
calls the Rinstall.exe application, the rinstall.exe application runs under the
context of the process token rather than the thread token. Unless the process
token is configured specifically for the Package and Deployment Wizard, in most
cases, it will be in the IWAM_computername account. The IWAM_computername
account does not have sufficient rights to install the CAB file.
