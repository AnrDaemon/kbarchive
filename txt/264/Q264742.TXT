TITLE   :Inactive LUs May Cause SnaPrint Service Utilization to Increase
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,4.0 SP1,4.0 SP2,4.0 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the LU that is being used by an SNA Server print session is inactive, the
SnaPrint service keeps trying to activate the session. The status of the print
session remains pending.

When many LUs are inactive and many print sessions are pending, the CPU
utilization may reach 90 percent or higher. Task Manager shows that the SnaPrint
service is using most of the processor time.

CAUSE
=====

The SnaPrint session waits for the LU to become available, and then the SnaPrint
service activates the print session.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you stop some of the pending print sessions, the amount of CPU utilization
should decrease.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design for cases where the SNA Server is restarted, but the
SnaPrint Server is not restarted.
