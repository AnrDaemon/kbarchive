KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to restrict Internet Mail from users by filtering
messages in the Internet Mail Service connector. When you select this option,
all internal users in the organization who use that Internet Mail Service
Connector for Internet mail delivery are affected.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can restrict mail flow from an Internet mail address to one particular user
or mailbox. To create this restriction, create a new custom recipient, set the
restrictions on the Internet mailbox, and then select the Internet mailbox on
which you want the restriction to be placed.

How to Create a New Custom Recipient
------------------------------------

1. From within the Exchange Administrator program, click New Custom Recipient on
   the File menu.

2. Click Internet Address as the e-mail address type, and then click OK.

3. Type in the Internet e-mail address that you want to restrict.

4. Type a display name and alias in the Mailbox Properties dialog box, and then
   click OK.

   Note that you only need to enter the display name and alias to perform this
   function.

How to Set Restrictions on the Internet Mailbox and then Select the Mailbox
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. From the Exchange Administrator program, double-click the mailbox for the
   user to get to the mailbox properties.

2. On the Delivery Restrictions tab, click Modify in the "Reject messages from
   delivery" section.

3. Click the Internet mail account that you just created, click Add, and then
   click OK.

To ensure that internal users do not attempt to send mail to the custom recipient
that you created, you may want to ensure that this account is hidden from the
global address list after step 2. To hide the user from the global address
list:

1. From the Exchange Administrator program, double-click the mailbox for the
   custom recipient to get to the mailbox properties.

2. On the Advanced tab, click to select the "Hide from address book" check box
   in the Custom Recipient Options section.
