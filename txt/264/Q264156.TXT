SUMMARY
=======

Including a .rc file within another .rc file may cause problems when the
codepages in the two .rc files do not match. For example, if you include a
Chinese resource file, Chsres.rc, in an English resource file, the combined
resource file may not compile correctly (unless the resource file is on a
Chinese platform). In the .rc file, if you do not provide a language and a
#pragma statement, the system default is always used.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To avoid the problem, you must set the language and #pragma statement correctly
before you include another .rc file. For example, in the English .rc file, add
the following lines before you include the Chinese resource file:

   LANGUAGE 04, 02
   #pragma code_page(936)
   #include "chsres.rc"
