TITLE   :PRB: Type Mismatch and Floating Point Error with CoolBar Control
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbActiveX kbCOMt kbCtrl kbVBp kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a program is compiled with the correct Visual Basic 6.0 version of
Comct332.ocx (CoolBar Control) version 6.00.xxxx (replace the xxxx with the
version from your latest service pack), and installed on a computer with version
6.6.0.8341 on it, you receive the following error message and the application
shuts down:

   Run time error 13 Type mismatch

If you are working in the integrated development environment (IDE), you also
receive a "Floating Point Inexact Result" error message. This behavior also
occurs when the program is compiled with the 6.6 version and you move it to a
computer with the 6.00 version.

CAUSE
=====

The cause is a beta Comct332.ocx file that was not approved for distribution due
to binary compatibility problems. This control is distributed by an early
version of InstallShield Professional 2000 (InstallShield for Windows).

RESOLUTION
==========

Unregister and delete the 6.6.0.8341 version, replace it with the 6.0x.xxxx
version from your service pack, and then recompile and rebuild any applications
that use the CoolBar control.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When developing a package with this version of InstallShield, the correct
version of Comct332.ocx is distributed.
