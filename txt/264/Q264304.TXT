SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to migrate data from a Lotus Notes environment to a Microsoft

created successfully. However, the 00000001.pri and 00000001.sec files are not
created.

CAUSE

does not have rights to the Organization, Site and Server containers in the
Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program.
