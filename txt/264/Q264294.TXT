The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the information that you need to use the Import Data
Wizard in Microsoft Streets and Trips 2001 or Microsoft MapPoint 2001.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Import Data Wizard requires the source file to contain the following
information to place records on a map:

 - Location information
 - Data fields

When you use the Import Data Wizard to import addresses in Microsoft Streets and
Trips 2001 or Microsoft MapPoint 2001, the program examines your source file for
the information it needs to place your records on the map.

Location Information
--------------------

Streets and Trips 2001 or MapPoint 2001 uses location information to match your
records to a location on the map. Streets and Trips 2001 or MapPoint 2001
attempts to assign column names based on the contents of your data.

For example, the following column headings are used to identify a geographic
location:

 - Address
 - City
 - Country
 - County
 - Latitude
 - Longitude
 - Province
 - State
 - ZIP or Postal Code

NOTE: You must use one of the headings provided in the Import Data Wizard for any
column in your data that contains location information, and you must confirm
that the heading for the column accurately corresponds to the contents of that
column.

Data Fields
-----------

Data fields contain all types of data other than location information. The
information in data fields is displayed in pushpin balloons.

The columns available for data fields are:

 - Name: Data in this column is displayed in the Name field of the pushpin
   balloon.

 - Name2: Data in this column is combined with the data in the Name column and
   is displayed in the Name field of the pushpin balloon.

 - Information: Data in this column is displayed in the Note field of the
   pushpin balloon. You can include any information in this field, including
   hyperlinks.

NOTE: If your data source does not contain the Name or Name2 column heading, the
Name field in the pushpin balloon uses the location information that was used to
match the record to the map.

How to Select or Change Column Headings
---------------------------------------

To select or change column headings:

1. If you import data from a text file or from Microsoft Excel, and the first
   row of your file does not include column headings, click to clear the "First
   row contains column headings" check box.

2. In the Country/Region box, click the correct country for your data.

   If your data contains records from more than one country, click Multi/Other,
   and make sure that the Country heading is matched to the column that contains
   the country names.

3. At the top of each column, type or select a descriptive heading as necessary.
   If you do not want to make the data in this column available on the map,
   click Skip Column.

   NOTE: You cannot use the same descriptive heading in more than one column.

4. Make sure that the following information is correct:

    - The column names.

    - The results message, which indicates that your data is mapped according to
      the type of geographic feature that you want.

5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for each column.
