SUMMARY
=======

If you use the Import Data Wizard in Microsoft MapPoint 2001 or Microsoft
Streets and Trips 2001 to import addresses to a map, the program searches the
imported data to find any geographic information that can be used to match the
records to locations on the map.

This article discusses how MapPoint 2001 and Streets & Trips 2001 recognize
geographic information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MapPoint 2001 and Streets & Trips 2001 search the imported data for column
headings that indicate that the field may contain geographic information, such
as:

 - City
 - Province
 - State
 - Street address
 - ZIP or Postal Code

If the program finds column headings that indicate that the field may contain
geographic information, the program uses the contents of that field to match
data to the map.

For example, if a column heading named "City" contains United States city names,
the program uses the data from that field to position the record in the
corresponding city on the map. The program then displays the following message:

   Matching records to City in the country/region: United States.

If the program does not find column headings that resemble a geographic area, the
program searches the imported data for five-digit numbers, number/letter
combinations, and two-letter sequences.

If the program does not find any data that may correspond to geographic
information, you cannot position your records on the map unless you choose an
appropriate heading for each column.
