TITLE   :Management Agent Does Not Update Object Attribute in Metaverse
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Metadirectory Services, when you use the Management Agent in
reflector mode to import objects from the connected directory into the
metaverse, the objects' attributes are not updated.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if attribute flow is not configured to update the user
object's attribute in the metadirectory. The general attribute flow rule applies
to all metaverse attributes that are not assigned values by a specific flow
rule. By default, this value is set to Never. This setting allows you to control
specific attribute flow. If attribute flow rules are not defined for an
attribute, the attribute is not updated when you run the Management Agent.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, configure attribute flow for the affected Management
Agent. There are several different configuration options.

NOTE: For a description of each option and its impact on the metaverse, refer to
the Metadirectory System Administration Guide online documentation.

To configure specific attribute flow, follow these steps:

1. Log on to Compass as an Administrator, click Action Panel, and then click the
   Bookmarks button.

2. Click Management Agent, and then click the Specific Flow Rules tab.

3. Specify both the attribute and the flow direction.

To configure general attribute flow to always update attributes, follow these
steps:

1. Log on to Compass as an Administrator, click Action Panel, and then click the
   Bookmarks button.

2. Click Management Agent, click the General Attribute Flow tab, and then click
   "Always Flow Attributes".

To configure the advanced attribute flow script, follow these steps:

1. Log on to Compass as an Administrator, click Action Panel, and then click the
   Bookmarks button.

2. Click Management Agent, and then click the "Advanced Flow Script" tab.

3. Type your template rules in the Edit box.

   NOTE: Templates and the template language are described in the Management
   Agent Toolkit manual.
