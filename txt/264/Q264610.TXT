======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3, 5.5 SP4 
 - Collaboration Data Objects (CDO), versions 1.2, 1.21 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you append a new line of text to an item's Text property and use a carriage
return (CR) and/or line feed (LF) to force them to separate lines, the Text
property ignores the CR and LF.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange store's Rich Text Format (RTF) synchronization routine groups the
existing and appended text in an attempt to preserve any RTF formatting of the
existing text. When checking for the existing text, it ignores changes that are
white space only; for example, additional line wrapping. In this case, the CR/LF
pair is recognized as a part of the existing text, and only the text that
follows it is considered to be appended.

RESOLUTION
==========

The workaround is to remove the item's CdoPR_RTF_COMPRESSED property before
appending to the Text property, as illustrated by the following Visual Basic
code:

   With objMyAppt
      'Delete the PR_RTF_COMPRESSED property so that
      'RTF synchronization does not take place.
      .Fields(CdoPR_RTF_COMPRESSED).Delete

      .Text = .Text & vbCrLf & "(Line 2) Drive safely!"
      .Update
   End With

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior:

   'NOTE: Assumes your project includes a reference to 
   '      "Microsoft CDO 1.21 Library".

   Dim objSession As MAPI.Session
   Dim objCalendar As MAPI.Folder
   Dim objMyAppt As MAPI.AppointmentItem

   Set objSession = CreateObject("MAPI.Session")
   objSession.Logon

   Set objCalendar = objSession.GetDefaultFolder(CdoDefaultFolderCalendar)
   Set objMyAppt = objCalendar.Messages.Add

   With objMyAppt
      'Add the first line.
      .Subject = "Test appointment"
      .Location = "Downtown"
      .Text = "(Line 1) Go for a drive."
      .Update
      MsgBox Prompt:=.Text, Title:="Before updating"

      'Add the second line.
      .Subject = "Updated test appointment"
      .Text = .Text & vbCrLf & "(Line 2) Drive safely!"
      .Update
      MsgBox Prompt:=.Text, Title:="After updating"
   End With

   'Log off and clean up.
   objSession.Logoff
   Set objMyAppt = Nothing
   Set objCalendar = Nothing
   Set objSession = Nothing
