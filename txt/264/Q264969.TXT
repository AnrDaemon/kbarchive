======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

One or two restarts are required on Windows 9x computers to complete the upgrade
of Systems Management Server clients to Service Pack 2 (SP2).

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the SP2 upgrade process starts on a Windows 9x client, the client base
components are upgraded first. A restart is necessary to allow the client to
continue the upgrade process.

After the restart, the remainder of the client agents are upgraded. If the
software distribution client agent is then installed, another restart of the
Windows 9x client is required to finish the upgrade of this component. A second
restart is not required if the software distribution client agent is not
installed.

The next Client Configuration Installation Manager (CCIM) cycle upgrades all
other client components without a restart, even if the software distribution
client agent has not yet been upgraded. The other client agents are not
installed immediately because the upgrade process freezes while waiting for a
restart after the software distribution client agent is upgraded. The CCIM cycle
(which can take up to 23 hours) triggers the upgrade to proceed on all other
client agents except for the software distribution client agent.
