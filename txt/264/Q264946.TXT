SYMPTOMS
========

Universal serial bus (USB) audio and video stream devices may not work if you
surprise-remove the device while the application is using the device, and then
plug the device back in.

CAUSE
=====

The USB hub driver in Windows 2000 releases bandwidth only on
IRP_MN_REMOVE_DEVICE IRP, not on IRP_MN_SURPRISE_REMOVAL.

Therefore, when a USB device is surprise-removed and if the application has a
handle to the device open, the system will not send an IRP_MN_REMOVE_DEVICE
until the handle is closed. As a result, the bandwidth is not released. If you
plug the device back in again, the device will not work because the system will
not be able to release enough bandwidth.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, either exit the application that is using the
device, or restart the system.
