CD-ROM: Error When Installing NT Option Pack With SP4
-----------------------------------------------------

When you install Windows NT Option Pack on a computer that already has Windows NT
4.0 Service Pack 4 installed, the following message appears:

   Setup detected that Windows NT 4.0 SP4 or greater is installed on your
   machine. We haven?t tested this product on SP4. Do you wish to proceed?

Click OK to continue the installation. Once the setup program has completed and
the computer has restarted, you should reinstall Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.

For further information on this error, please refer to the the follwing KB
article:

   Q195015 Option Pack Installation Conflicts with Service Pack 4

For information on the conflict between Windows NT Service Pack 4 and Client
Certificates, please refer to the following KB article:

   Q194788 Windows NT Service Pack 4 and Client Certificates


CD-ROM: Incorrect Permissions On Component Folder
-------------------------------------------------

After installing the Rent-A-Prize application and browsing the RentAPrizeHome.asp
page, you may receive the following error message:

   bsReservation error'800a005b' Object variable or With block variable not set
   /Rent-A-Prize/Customer/RentAPrizehome.asp, line 69

This is caused by incorrect permissions on the Components folder of the
Rent-A-Prize application.

The following steps will resolve this issue:
In the Internet Service Manager MMC snap-in, locate the Components folder in the
Rent-A-Prize application's folder, right-click the folder and select Properties.
In the Properties dialog box, change the permissions on the folder from Script
to Execute.

The original instructions for registering and packaging components can be found
in Appendix B, on page 550.


Page 217: Missing Trailing Quote In Code Sample
-----------------------------------------------

In the code sample at the top of page 217, the first sText line is missing the
ending quotation mark (").

This should read:

   sText = "<H1>When writing text to the browser,</H1>"
