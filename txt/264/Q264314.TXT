TITLE   :XADM: Mailbox Move Fails with Error 80004005-0501-000004dd
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program to move a
mailbox within the same site, you may receive the following error message:

   Client operation failed: 80004005-0501-000004dd

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the mailbox size limit on the destination store is
lower than the required size limit. If the mailbox is moved, the size exceeds
administrator-configured mailbox size limits on the destination store.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, either remove messages from the source mailbox to
reduce its size so that it remains below the destination mailbox size limit, or
increase the destination mailbox size limit to accommodate the source mailbox.
