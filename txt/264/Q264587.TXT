TITLE   :XADM: Error with Import of the Home-MDB and Home-MTA Attributes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to import a .csv file into an Exchange Server folder with the
Home-MDB attribute, you may receive the following error message:

   The Home-MDB attribute is not directly importable.

Also, the following event is logged in the application event log:

   Event ID: 154
   Source: MSExchangeDSImp
   Category: none
   Type: Error
   Description: The attribute Home-MDB is not directly importable

Also, the following event is logged in the application event log:

   Event ID: 154
   Source: MSExchangeDSImp
   Category: none
   Type: Error
   Description: The attribute Home-MTA is not directly importable.

CAUSE
=====

If you use the Headers.exe utility to export your Exchange Server folder
attributes to a .csv file and select all attributes, the Home-MDB and Home-MTA
attributes are created in the .csv file. If you then export your folder to the
.csv file and later use the .csv file to import, the import procedure does not
work because you cannot import the Home-MDB and Home-MTA attributes.

RESOLUTION
==========

Before you perform the import procedure, edit the .csv file that you created
from the Headers.exe utility, and then delete the columns of the Home-MDB and
Home-MTA attributes.
