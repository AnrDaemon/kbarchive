TITLE   :XADM: Lsmexif.dll 5.5.2651.22 Fix Breaks Inbody Addressing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP5fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you implement the Linkage Message Exchange (Lsmexif.dll version
5.5.2651.22) fix, users may no longer be able to send Simple Mail Transfer
Protocol (SMTP) messages by using inbody addressing.


CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because in the original implementation of the
AllowUnresolvedAddresses parameter, if you set the AllowUnresolvedAddresses
parameter to No, all e-mail addresses that are not in the global address list
are rejected, including SMTP addresses. The AllowUnresolvedAddresses parameter
stops potential looping problems with the Microsoft Exchange Connector for
SNADS, but this parameter also prevents users from using inbody addressing to
send messages to SMTP addresses, because SMTP addresses are not in the global
address list. When this parameter is used, users cannot carbon copy Internet
users when users send e-mail messages.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
