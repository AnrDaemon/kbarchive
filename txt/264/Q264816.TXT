   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

If an Exchange Server computer only has a private information store and does not
have a Pub.edb file, Performance Optimizer may not move any files. Performance
Optimizer checks the registry for the ParametersPrivate and ParametersPublic
keys and determines whether there are consistent databases before Performance
Optimizer moves any files. If an administrator has removed the Pub.edb file, a
new file must be put in place for Performance Optimizer to work. If you create a
file called Pub.edb, the Performance Optimizer does not finish.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this issue:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the DB Path value under the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersPublic

3. Modify the DB Path value from C:\Exchsrvr\Mdbdata\Pub.edb to
   C:\Exchsrvr\Mdbdata\Priv.edb; on the Edit menu, click REG_SZ, type
   "C:\Exchsrvr\Mdbdata\Priv.edb" (without the quotation marks), and then click
   OK.

   This enables Performance Optimizer to finish.

   NOTE: Change this DB Path value back to C:\Exchsrvr\Mdbdata\Pub.edb after
   Performance Optimizer finishes.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

5. Create a Pub.edb file on a computer that has the same organization and site
   name, and then copy the new 2 megabyte (MB) file to the specified folder from
   the registry.

6. Stop the information store, and then run an isinteg -patch command. This
   enables Performance Optimizer to finish.
