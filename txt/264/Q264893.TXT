TITLE   :Installer Overwrites Tmp File Using "Insert Line into Text File"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the "Insert line into text file" option in Microsoft Systems
Management Server (SMS) Installer, a temporary file named ~Glbs383.glb is
created. When other clients on the network write to the same location, this
temporary file may be overwritten.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you use a script that writes to a text file on a
network drive. Different computers that run the script can update the same
temporary .glb file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, first create the file locally, and then copy it to
the network drive. Copy the local file from <Nameoftext>.txt to
<Sharename Nameoftext>.txt.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
