-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Motocross Madness 2, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start a race in Microsoft Motocross Madness 2, textures on the
motorcycles and riders may be distorted. In addition, textures and colors in the
background may also be distorted.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if both of the following conditions are true:

 - A video adapter based on the 3DLabs Permedia 2 chip set is installed in your
   computer

 - You installed Motocross Madness 2 on a Microsoft Windows 2000-based computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, configure the 3-D renderer to use Software
Rasterization.

To do this, click Software Rasterization in the "Please Choose a 3-D Card" dialog
box that is displayed on the screen when you start the game.

If you do not see this dialog box when you start the game:

1. On the Motocross Madness 2 startup screen, click Options ([GRAPHIC:the three
   gears]).

2. Click Advanced.

3. Click to select the "Show 3-D Renderer Selector at Startup" check box.

4. Click Back ([GRAPHIC:the pointing hand]) until you return to the Motocross
   Madness 2 startup screen.

5. Quit and then restart Motocross Madness 2.
