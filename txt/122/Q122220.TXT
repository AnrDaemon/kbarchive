TITLE   :FIX: Return Value Not Ignored with NMAKE's Dash (-) Command
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER::1.0,1.5,1.51,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Program Maintenance Utility (NMAKE), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 1.5, 1.51 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 1.0, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the dash command (-) in a makefile to turn off error checking for a
given command, return values that are greater than 255 will not be ignored.
NMAKE will detect an error and the make process will be terminated, as shown
below:

   NMAKE : fatal error U1077: 'C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\CMD.EXE' : return
   code '0xYYY'
   Stop.

YYY is the hexadecimal value of the return code from the command that generated
the error.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the !CMDSWITCHES (+/-) I directive to work around this problem. For
example:

      !CMDSWITCHES +I
      mylabel:
           mycommand
      !CMDSWITCHES -I

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was fixed in Microsoft Visual C++,
32-bit Edition, version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sample Code
-----------

The following makefile will prematurely terminate after the mycommand statement
if an error MYCOMMAND.EXE returns is a value greater that 255. A small MS-DOS-
or Windows NT-based console program returning a value can be used as mycommand.

   mylabel:
        -mycommand
