The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Asimov for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you encounter problems using Setup to install Microsoft Asimov, you can
use the PSS.BAT file on the CD-ROM to perform a manual installation of the
program. Follow the directions documented in the MSETUP.TXT file located on
the <X>:\ASIMOV\MSSTP\MANUAL directory of your Asimov CD-ROM disk, where
<X> is your CD-ROM drive.

CAUTION: Do not use these steps if your are using Microsoft Windows 95
or Microsoft Windows NT. The manual installation uses a batch file that
copies Windows 3.x system files onto your hard drive. Allowing the system
files to be overwritten in Windows 95 or Windows NT may cause improper
system performance.
