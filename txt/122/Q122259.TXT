======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The ClassWizard, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows 
    - Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, versions 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to import a class into a project using ClassWizard, and locating
the header file and implementation file using the Browse buttons to select a
path to each file, you may get an error when you click the OK button even though
the paths to the files are valid.

If either path has a drive letter in it, ClassWizard displays a message box with
this error message:

   The file name "<full path to file>" is not a valid file name. Please
   enter a valid file name.

When the message box is dismissed, the Import Class dialog has the path
highlighted for change even though the file name and path are valid.

If either path is a relative path that does not include drive letter, such as
..\..\DIR1\DIR2\MYFILE.H, ClassWizard displays a message box with this error
message:

   The file names [<full path to header file>, <full path to
   implementation file>] for class "<class name>" do not exist or are
   invalid file names.

ClassWizard will accept a relative path that indicates one level above the
current directory, such as ..\DIR1\DIR2\MYFILE.H.

RESOLUTION
==========

To successfully import the class, change the path to the header and
implementation files, so they are not relative paths and do not contain a drive
letter. For example, ClassWizard will not accept this:

   C:\DIR1\MYFILE.H and ..\..\..\MYFILE.H

But ClassWizard will accept this:

   \DIR1\MYFILE.H

An alternative solution is to copy the files to the project directory. Note that
in any case, you need to add the class implemenation files to your project. When
you import a class, ClassWizard will not update your project to include the
implementation files for the classes you import.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ 4.1.
