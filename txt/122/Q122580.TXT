-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2, 3.2a 
 - Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to open a Microsoft Excel attachment from a Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks Windows client, Excel starts but the file attachment is not loaded. The
only menu options available are File and Help.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if you have checked the Ignore Other Applications option in
Excel. This option allows Excel to start, but tells Excel to ignore all
parameters passed to it, including filenames. When Microsoft Mail opens an Excel
attachment, it sends the command to start Excel and passes the attachment
filename as a parameter.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can open the file in Excel by choosing Open from the File menu.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To check or uncheck the Ignore Other Applications option, perform the following
steps:

1. Start Excel.

2. From the Tools menu, choose Options.

3. Select the General tab.

4. Check or uncheck the Ignore Other Applications box.
