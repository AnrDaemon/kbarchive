The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade from Windows NT version 3.1 to Windows NT version 3.5, some
applications, such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, may not be able to
view or print to newly created or connected printers if you have stopped and
then restarted the Spooler service. This problem only occurs with the user
account that was logged on when the Spooler service was stopped and restarted.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by incorrect security permissions being written to a
section of the Registry from where some applications get printer data. Because
this section is set to Read Only, new printers are not written to it and some
applications will not be able to access the newly created printers.


WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, change Administrators to Full Control in both the
Devices and PrinterPorts keys, using the Registry Editor as follows:

   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
   problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
   Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
   Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

2. From the HKEY_CURRENT_USER subtree, go to the following subkey:

   \SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion

3. Select the Devices subkey and from the menu, select Security, Permissions.

4. Change Administrators to Full Control and choose OK.

5. Select the PrinterPorts subkey and from the menu, select Security,
   Permissions.

6. Change Administrators to Full Control and choose OK.

7. Exit Registry Editor.

8. Open the Properties Of A Created Printer dialog box in Print Manager, choose
   OK, and the Created printers will be rewritten to the Registry. Connected To
   Printers must be recreated.

NOTE: This problem will occur again if the Spooler service is stopped and
restarted. Use the above procedure if necessary.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT Workstation or Server version 3.51.
