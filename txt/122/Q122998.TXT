   Dim M As MapiMessage
   Dim Mo As MapiRecip
   ReDim R(0 To 1) As MapiRecip
   ReDim F(0 To 0) As MapiFile
   NL = Chr(10)

   F(0).Reserved = 0&
   F(0).Flags = 0&
   F(0).Position = -1
   F(0).PathName = "C:\budget17.wk3"
   F(0).FileName = "budget17.wk3"
   F(0).FileType = ""

   Msg1$ = "Attached is the budget proposal. "
   Msg2$ = "See you Monday."

   M.Subject = Msg1$ + Msg2$
   M.MessageType = ""
   M.RecipCount = 2
   M.FileCount = 1

   R(0).Reserved = 0&
   R(0).RecipClass = MAPI_To
   R(0).Name = "Sally Jones"
   R(0).EIDSize = 0&
   R(0).EntryID = ""

   R(1).Reserved = 0&
   R(1).RecipClass = MAPI_To
   R(1).Name = "Marketing"
   R(1).EIDSize = 0&
   R(1).EntryID = ""

   rc& = MAPILogon(0&, "admin", "password", 0&, 0&, lhSession&)

   rc& = MAPISendMail(0&, 0&, M, R(0), F(0), 0&, 0&)
   If rc& <> SUCCESS_SUCCESS Then MsgBox "Unable to send the message."

   rc& = MAPILogoff(lhSession&, 0&, 0&, 0&)
   End
   ' ****************************
   ' End of source code
   ' ****************************

To get the code to work, MAPILogon and MAPILogoff function calls have been
included in the source code.
