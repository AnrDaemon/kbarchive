TITLE   :FIX: Cannot Set Breakpoint if Project Contains \C++\ in Path
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Integrated Debugger, included with:
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The debugger is unable to set breakpoints when you use the Visual C++ integrated
debugger to debug a project located in a directory that contains
non-alphanumeric characters (for example, a path that contains \C++\) -- which
is a directory name supported by the Windows NT File System (NTFS).

It is possible to set a breakpoint in a source file, but attempting to start a
debug session generates this error message:

   The breakpoint "{,test.cpp,}.linenum" cannot be set

Here test.cpp is the source file and linenum is the line number where the
breakpoint is set.

CAUSE
=====

The integrated debugger can't handle file names supported only on NTFS.

RESOLUTION
==========

Avoid the use of NTFS-specific file names or directory names.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was fixed in Microsoft Visual C++,
32-bit Edition, version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create an MFC AppWizard project. When placing the project in a directory,
   give a directory name that contains special characters (for example, C++).

2. Build the project for debug mode.

3. Place a breakpoint on a line of code in your project.

4. Press the F5 key. A dialog box should appear that reads, "The breakpoint ...
   cannot be set."
