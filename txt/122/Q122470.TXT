The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Ancient Lands for Windows, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Complete Baseball for Windows, version 1994 edition 
 - Microsoft Cinemania, versions 1992 editions, 1994 editions 
 - Microsoft Dangerous Creatures for Windows, version 1.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following behaviors may occur in the applications listed above:

 - When you run a video clip, music clip, or dialog and then use the mouse to
   click another item in the list, the list scrolls a page or two.

 - The mouse pointer does not snap correctly to the active default button.
   Instead, it snaps to a location approximately 20 pixels below the active
   default button. In some cases, the position it snaps to may actually be
   outside the application window.

 - Whenever you close a dialog box, the cursor jumps to a blank spot about an
   inch to the right of the Index button. This also occurs when you close
   another application and Baseball 1994 regains the focus.

RESOLUTION
==========

This behavior occurs if the Snap-To check box in the Mouse Manager for the
Microsoft Mouse driver version 9.01 is selected. Clearing the Snap-To check box
corrects the problem. (To do this, choose the Mouse icon in Control Panel, and
clear the Snap To check box under Extra Points.)

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information about your mouse and turning off the Snap-To feature, refer
to the user's guide for your mouse.
