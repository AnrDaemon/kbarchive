TITLE   :Err Msg: The Trust Relationship...Could Not Be Verified...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.1,3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When establishing a trust between two domains, if there is a session already
established between the two domain controllers the following message appears on
the Windows NT 3.x domain controller:

   The trust relationship between XXXX and YYYY could not be verified at this
   time. If you find that it was not established, contact the administrator of
   the XXXX domain and verify that it has been permitted YYYY to trust.

On a Windows NT 4.0 domain controller, the following error message appears:

   The trust relationship cannot be verified because this machine has a session
   open to <computer name>, the Primary Domain Controller of domain XXXX.
   Do you wish to continue setting up the trust relationship?

(<computer name> is the machine name for the PDC, XXXX is the trusted
domain, and YYYYY is the trusting domain.)

CAUSE
=====

The trust may have been established and may be working correctly. The reason
this message appears is that there was already a session established between the
domain controllers under a user account (specifically, the session would have to
have been established from YYYY to XXXX). This session keeps the special trust
verification from being sent because the Windows NT redirector
(LanmanWorkstation) can establish remote sessions under only one user account
per remote server.
