The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The linker (version 1.0, dated 23-Jun-1994) included with Microsoft FORTRAN
PowerStation 32 interacts incorrectly with Microsoft Windows NT version 3.5, but
works fine with Windows NT version 3.1.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the version of LINK.EXE
(version 1.0, dated 23-Jun-1994) that shipped with Microsoft FORTRAN
PowerStation 32 version 1.0 for Windows NT. To correct this problem, please
obtain the new version of LINK.EXE (version 1.0, dated 9-Aug-1994) that corrects
the problem and replace the old LINK.EXE.
