The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the root directory of a Windows NT Server version 3.5 is a Macintosh volume
and is shared for the PC-based client computers, any new directories created in
the root directory by PC-based client computers are viewable by the Macintosh
client computers, but the files in that directory are not viewable. In addition,
any new subdirectories added to any existing directory are not viewable.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, remove the Macintosh volume and recreate it.

To correct this problem, upgrade to Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server
3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem has been corrected in Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server
version 3.51.
