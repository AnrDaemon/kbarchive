The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT version 3.5 on a Gateway 2000 P5-60 (with hardware
components on the PCI bus), the computer may stop responding (hang), or the
following error message may appear when several files in the graphical portion
of Setup run:

   Unable to copy <filename>. The source may be corrupted.
   Abort, Retry, Fail

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

1. Verify that the computer is using the PCI chip set of either the Mercury
   S82434NX or Mercury II.

2. Remove all PCI-based hardware components and try to install Windows NT
   version 3.5. If unsuccessful, remove the memory modules (SIMM) and replace
   them with standard 4 megabyte (MB) memory modules. This computer is
   originally shipped with a 16 MB memory module.
