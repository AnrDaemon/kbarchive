To make a Token Ring Network Installation Startup Disk using NWLink IPX
Compatible Protocol with the Network Client Administrator utility, the
frame type has to be manually changed in the PROTOCOL.INI (or NET.CFG) file
because the network startup disk uses Ethernet 802.2 as the default frame
type. In a Token Ring environment, this may cause an error when you try to
use the NET USE or NET VIEW commands:

   Error 53: Network not found

Following are the required Token Ring frame type syntaxes for workstations
that need PROTOCOL.INI modifications:

Network Client version 3.0 for MS-DOS and Windows:

   FRAME=TOKENRING

Windows for Workgroups 3.11:

    FRAME=TOKEN-RING

NetWare (modify NET.CFG):

   FRAME=TOKEN-RING and TOKEN-RING_SNAP

Other frame types include the following:

   ETHERNET_802.2  (Default)
   ETHERNET_802.3
   ETHERNET_II
   ETHERNET_SNAP
