TITLE   :Microsoft RAS & At Work PC Fax Won't Run w/ XEMCOMM.DRV Loaded
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If Xircom PCMCIA Modem or Modem+Ethernet is running on your computer, neither
Microsoft Remote Access Service (RAS) nor Microsoft At Work PC Fax installs or
runs correctly.

CAUSE
=====

Both Xircom PCMCIA Modem and Modem+Ethernet replace the Windows COMM.DRV file
with a Xircom proprietary communications driver, XEMCOMM.DRV. The XEMCOMM.DRV
driver is incompatible with Microsoft Remote Access Service (RAS) and Microsoft
At Work PC Fax.

By contrast, the XEMCOMM.DRV driver runs correctly with Windows Terminal and
other Windows-based communication applications.

STATUS
======

At this time, there is no workaround for this problem. For more information,
contact Xircom technical support.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The PCMCIA Modem and Modem+Ethernet products included here are manufactured by
Xircom, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or
otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability.
