The information in this article applies to:

 - The C Run-Time (CRT), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, 16-bit edition, versions 1.5, 1.51 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 2.0, 2.1, 4.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When the standard output and error streams are redirected or piped, console
application output may not be serialized. This can result in unexpected output.

CAUSE
=====

Although devices as serialized by default, the current Microsoft CRT
implementation does not treat pipes as if they were devices (due to the
potentially high overhead--added code--of doing so.) Thus, if stderr and stdout
refer to the same file or device, and output is redirected with a pipe, the
output will not be serialized.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. The potential for slow execution currently outweighs
the effort necessary to implement pipes such that they are treated as devices.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To demonstrate this behavior, build and run the sample code (TEST.C) below. If
it is executed from an MS-DOS or Windows NT command prompt, the following output
is generated:

  c:\>test
  hello world (stdout)
  hello world (stderr)
  hello world (stdout)
  hello world (stderr)

However, if the output is piped with the MORE command, it will not be serialized,
as follows:

  c:\>test | more
  hello world (stderr)
  hello world (stderr)
  hello world (stdout)
  hello world (stdout)

Sample Code
-----------

      /* Compile options needed: none
      /*

      /* TEST.C */ 

      #include <stdio.h>

      int main(void)
      {
        printf ( "Hello world (stdout)\n" );
        fprintf ( stderr, "Hello world (stderr)\n" );
        printf ( "Hello world (stdout)\n" );
        fprintf ( stderr, "Hello world (stderr)\n" );
      }
