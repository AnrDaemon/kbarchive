TITLE   :AppStart Doesn't Change Cursor to Hourglass
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork smsgeneral kbArtTypeINF

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you start a Microsoft Systems Management Server shared application,
AppStart does not change the cursor to the "waiting" hourglass cursor. This may
cause the user to think the application wasn't launched.

CAUSE
=====

AppStart isn't changing the cursor type when it is called. Because AppStart can
take up to 15-20 seconds before the actual application loads and starts, the
cursor will remain an arrow for this amount of time until the actual application
takes over and changes the cursor type.

This can result in the user thinking the application didn't launch and attempting
to launch the same application again, resulting in multiple copies of the
application being launched when AppStart finally catches up with the user's
input.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
