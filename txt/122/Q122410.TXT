SUMMARY
=======

The return value of the pow() function, which computes the value of x raised to
the y power, is not documented in the case of pow(0,0). In this case, the pow()
function returns 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The behavior of pow(0,0) conforms to the proposed NCEG (Numerical C Extensions
Group) standard. See NCEG draft 92-014, F.4.3 for more information. The
documents were corrected in Microsoft Visual C++, version 4.0.
