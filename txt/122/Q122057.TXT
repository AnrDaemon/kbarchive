The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When not using Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) for NetBIOS name resolution
in a TCP/IP network, the Windows NT system initiating the remote control session
must have an LMHOSTS file configured with the name and IP address of the remote
client.

New to SMS 1.2 is the ability to do remote control over TCP/IP sockets. This does
not require any name resolution to function properly, but instead uses the IP
address for that client defined in the SMS database.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In order for Remote Control to work properly on a TCP/IP network without WINS,
you must configure the LMHOSTS file on the computer running the Systems
Management Server Administrator (hereinafter referred to as the "server").
Configure the server's LMHOSTS file as follows:

NOTE: Letters C and E must be located on the 16th position after the opening
quotation mark. Pad the entry with spaces if necessary. Quotation marks are not
optional.

Server LMHOSTS Entry
--------------------

<IP address><tab>"<client name> C" (Letter C activates Remote
Control)

<IP address><tab>"<client name> E" (Letter E activates Remote
Chat options on the server side)

Example:

130.20.37.30 "SMS_Client C"

130.20.37.30 "SMS_Client E"

The reason that only the server LMHOSTS file must be configured (as opposed to
both the server LMHOSTS file as well as the client LMHOSTS file) is that the
NetBIOS session is always initiated by the server and never by the client.
