OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Eagle technical support reports that Windows for Workgroups does not work when
you use either the Windows for Workgroups drivers supplied with the Novell/Eagle
NE200 PCMCIA Ethernet cards or the drivers Eagle distributes on its bulletin
board service (BBS). The Novell/Eagle EP2000 Plus also doesn't work with NDIS
drivers.

CAUSE
=====

Driver Disks Supplied with NE200 Card
-------------------------------------

At least some of the driver disks that Eagle distributes with the NE200 PCMCIA
card incorrectly supply an OEMSETUP.INF file for the Eagle NE3210 card, which
uses entirely different drivers and settings than the NE200.

Drivers Supplied on Eagle BBS
-----------------------------

Even though the disk that Eagle distributes on its BBS includes an improved
OEMSETUP.INF file, the supplied NDIS driver still does not load successfully
under Windows for Workgroups.

STATUS
======

Eagle is aware of these problems and is working on solutions. You can contact
Eagle Technical Services at (800) 726-5267.
