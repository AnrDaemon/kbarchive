TITLE   :BUG: ODS Driver May Give an Error on Outer Join Escape Clause
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbBug kbISS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG# Addon_Bugs: 10589 (1.02.3231)

SYMPTOMS
========

This information applies to driver developers writing a resource dynamic link
library (DLL) for their Open Data Services (ODS) gateway using the ODS ODBC
driver. The ODS driver gives a syntax error if the resource DLL indicates that
Transact-SQL style outer joins are not supported by the gateway. Driver
developers wanting to access an ODS gateway via ODBC can use the ODS ODBC driver
and write a resource DLL for this driver.

WORKAROUND
==========

Driver developers should set IDS_FEATURE_TSQL_OJ_SUPPORT to Y, and make sure
that the gateway supports Transact-SQL style outer joins.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in ODBC ODS Driver version
1.02.3231. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The resource DLL is used to customize the driver to work with the capabilities
provided by the ODS gateway. One of the things that can be customized is the
type of outer joins the gateway can handle. This is controlled by two entries in
the rc file associated with the resource DLL:

 - IDS_INFO_OFFSET+SQL_OUTER_JOINS

 - IDS_FEATURE_TSQL_OJ_SUPPORT

When IDS_INFO_OFFSET+SQL_OUTER_JOINS is set to Y, it indicates the gateway
supports outer joins. When IDS_FEATURE_TSQL_OJ_SUPPORT is set to Y, it indicates
the gateway supports the outer join syntax of Transact-SQL. Setting these to N
means these features are not supported.

When a gateway supports outer joins but does not support Transact-SQL style outer
joins, the ODS gateway driver does not parse the outer join escape clause to
convert it to a Transact-SQL style outer join; instead, it will send it through
to the gateway.

To achieve this behavior, IDS_INFO_OFFSET+SQL_OUTER_JOINS should be set to Y, and
IDS_FEATURE_TSQL_OJ_SUPPORT should be set to N. However, when this is done, the
ODS driver instead of sending the escape clause through to the gateway generates
a syntax error. For example, if the application calls SQLExecDirect to execute
the following statement:

   SELECT *  FROM {oj <table1> LEFT OUTER JOIN <table2>
               ON <table1>.<col1> = <table2>.<col2> }

You get an error:

   SQLSTATE 37000
   [Microsoft][ODBC ODS Gateway Driver]Syntax error in SQL dynamic statement
