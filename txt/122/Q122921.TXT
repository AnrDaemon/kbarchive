-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT version 3.5 Setup may not complete installation on IBM 8640-OP*
computers. Setup stops responding (hangs) when it reboots to the graphical user
interface (GUI) portion of Setup. No error message appears.

CAUSE
=====

The IBM 8640-OP* computer is equipped with an IBM PCI SCSI adapter that is not
currently supported by Windows NT version 3.5. The standard equipment video card
is also manufactured by IBM and does not work with Windows NT version 3.5.

This computer is on the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) for Windows NT version
3.5, but this does not include the standard SCSI and video card.

WORKAROUND
==========

The only workaround for this problem at this time is to install a video card and
a SCSI adapter that are supported by Windows NT version 3.5.


The IBM products discussed here are manufactured by International Business
Machines Corporation, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty,
implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability.
