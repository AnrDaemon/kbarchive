The LPQ command line utility does not work when used with a Hewlett-Packard
Jet Direct card. The following error message appears:

   Error: <server> did not respond correctly.

This is because the Jet Direct card does not have the ability to monitor
print queues. The LPQ command will work properly with a server that has a
print queue.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When using TCP/IP printing services, LPQ can be used to obtain the status of a
print queue on a host running the Line Printer Daemon (LPD) server. The
following is the syntax for the LPQ command:

   lpq  -Sserver -Pprinter [-l]

   Options:

   -S server    Name or IP address of the host providing LPD service
   -P printer   Name of the print queue
   -l           Verbose output
