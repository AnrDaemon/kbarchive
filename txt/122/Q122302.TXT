TITLE   :FIX: C1001 Error Compiling Naked Function with /Og and /G5
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), included with:
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, version 2.0, on platform(s):
       - the hardware: Intel x86 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Compiling a function with the __declspec(naked) modifier, but without an __asm
block for the epilog code, and using the /Og and /G5 switches, results in the
following error:

   fatal error C1001: INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR
   (compiler file 'l:\b_bld\c2\P2\main.c', line 374)
   Please choose the Technical Support command on the Visual C++ Help menu, or
   open the Technical Support help file for more information

RESOLUTION
==========

Implement a epilog code block in your function.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was fixed in Microsoft Visual C++,
32-bit Edition, version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a function is declared with the __declspec(naked) modifier, the compiler will
not generate any prolog or epilog code. Users should implement their own prolog
and epilog code, using blocks of inline assembler code.

NOTE: without proper prolog and epilog code, the code will not execute
correctly.

Sample Code
-----------

   /* Compile options needed: /Og /G5
      Note that /O1, /O2, and /Ox all imply /Og
   */ 

   void __declspec(naked) NakedFunction()
   {
       __asm
       {
       // prolog code
       }

       printf( "Inside naked function\n" );

       // note: epilog __asm block missing
   }
