TITLE   :ScanDisk Does Not Check for Lowercase Characters in Filenames
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a disk stores a file that has lowercase letters in its filename, ScanDisk
does not find any problems with the file structure, even though you cannot gain
access to the file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, rename or delete the file by using wildcards, or
use a third-party program such as Norton's DiskEdit to change the lowercase
letters.

NOTE: Lowercase letters can sometimes occur as a result of using Microsoft
Undelete for Windows, version 6.0. For specific workaround information, please
see the following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q98404 "Using MS Undelete to Restore Files with Existing Filenames"

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS version 6.22. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.

Additional query words: 6.22
