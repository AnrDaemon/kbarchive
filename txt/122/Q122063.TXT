SYMPTOMS
========

When you are working in Windows Explorer, trying to rename, delete, or move a
file that appears to have an underscore in its filename generates a file access
error. For example, trying to rename a file generates the following error:

   Error Renaming File

   Cannot rename C:\file_: Cannot find the specified file. Make sure you specify
   the correct path and filename.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when the file includes extended ANSI characters that Windows
Explorer does not recognize in its filename. Windows Explorer displays
unrecognized characters as underscores. Some MS-DOS-based applications use
extended ASCII characters (such as line-drawing characters) in filenames to
protect important files from accidentally being changed in any way.

RESOLUTION
==========

To rename, move, or delete the file, open an MS-DOS prompt, and make the changes
from the command line using the appropriate ANSI characters. Consult the ANSI
character set to determine which numeric code corresponds to the extended
character in the filename.
