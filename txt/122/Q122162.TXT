TITLE   :SMC9000.DOS Doesn't Activate Megahertz PCMCIA Ethernet Card
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you load the SMC9000.DOS driver version 1.03 (dated 3/23/94) supplied with
the Megahertz PCMCIA Ethernet card, the driver appears to load successfully, but
it does not activate the PCMCIA card. When the driver loads, the Link light on
the card's transceiver turns off.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the version 1.03 of the
SMC9000.DOS driver dated 3/23/94.

NOTE: The OEMSETUP.INF file, supplied with the Megahertz card, loads the
incompatible SMC9000.DOS driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

An updated release of SMC9000.DOS version 1.03 that corrects this problem is
available. The file date is 11/24/93. This updated driver is located in the
\MSLANMAN.DOSDRIVERS\ETHERNET\MEGAHRTZ subdirectory of the Megahertz driver
distribution disk.

IMPORTANT: Neither the 3/23/94 nor the 11/24/93 version of SMC9000.DOS version
1.03 works correctly if you are using the Phoenix 3.0 card and socket services
in place of the Cardsoft services supplied with the Megahertz card.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Megahertz PCMCIA Ethernet card is identical to the SMC 9000 card. Both use
the SMC9000.DOS Network Device Interface Specification (NDIS) driver.

The Megahertz PCMCIA Ethernet and SMC 9000 products included here are
manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied
or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability.
