======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, version 2.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The online help and the "Class Library Reference" incorrectly describe the
CWnd::OnCommand() wParam and lParam as follows:

In Visual C++ 2.0
-----------------

wParam Identifies the command ID of the menu item or control.

lParam The low-order word of lParam identifies the control that sends the message
if the message is from a control. Otherwise the low-order word is 0. The
high-order word of lParam specifies the notification message if the message is
from a control. If the message is from an accelerator, the high-order word is 1.
If the message is from a menu, the high-order word is 0.

In Visual C++ 5.0
-----------------

wParam The low-order word of wParam identifies the command ID of the menu item or
control. The high-order word of wParam specifies the notification message if the
message is from a control. If the message is from an accelerator, the high-order
word is 1. If the message is from a menu, the high-order word is 0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The description above is valid for Windows-based Applications, but it is invalid
for Win32-based Applications. The Win32 API widens the WPARAM type to 32 bits
and changes the packing of many of the messages. The parameters for
CWnd::OnCommand() should be documented as follows:

   wParam The low-order word of wParam specifies the identifier of the menu
   item, control, or accelerator. The high-order word specifies the notification
   code if the message is from a control. If the message is from an accelerator,
   the high-order word is 1. If the message is from a menu, the high-order word
   is 0.

   lParam Handle (HWND) of the control sending the message if the message is from
   a control. Otherwise, this parameter is NULL.
