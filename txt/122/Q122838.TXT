The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Directory Replicator Service (LMREPL) in Windows NT Server version 3.5 and
Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1 has a memory leak, which can slowly
consume nonpaged pool resources and as a result, it can degrade system
performance.

CAUSE
=====

The leak appears to be located at the client side of LMREPL which wakes up each
15 minutes to perform a replication, depending on the results of a cyclic
redundancy check (CRC). Each 15-minute pulse consumes approximately 1 kilobyte
(K) of nonpaged pool.

WORKAROUND
==========

Periodically, the Directory Replicator can be stopped and restarted to free the
memory; this should be done at regular intervals (every two weeks or so) until a
fix is available.

To monitor this resource, use Performance Monitor to look at Object
<Process>, Instance <LMREPL>, Counter <Pool NonPaged Bytes>.
The initial value should be approximately 9860 bytes and values larger than this
can indicate a leak. Over a period of weeks, this value can grow to 3 megabytes
(MB) or more.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Advanced Server
version 3.1 and Windows NT Server version 3.5. This problem was corrected in the
latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.5. For information on
obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
