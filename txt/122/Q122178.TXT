Event Log Codes 100 - 199
-------------------------

Code   Description
----   -----------

100    Machine classes: There is an error in the records of a varfile.

101    Machine classes: Exception <X> occurred for file <Y>.

102    Cannot find the site server for site X.

103    Cannot connect to the registry on site server X in site Y.

104    The component is unable to delete registry key X.

105    The component is unable to create registry key X.

106    Failed to remove package X from Y. Verify the package server is up
       and running and no one is currently using the package.

107    Failed to remove directory X. Verify there is no active process
       access the directory.

108    Failed to install package to X. Verify the package server is up and
       running and has sufficient disk space. The SMS service account must
       exist on the package server and has the same password as the
       siteserver, and the service account must have admin privilege. If
       the package server is a Netware server, verify the volume exists.

109    Failed to install package. There isn't sufficient disk space on
       package server X. Disk space available on that server is Y
       megabytes, space required is Z megabytes.

110    Failed to create directory on server X. Verify the server is up and
       running, The SMS service account must exist on the server and has
       the same password as the site server, and the service account must
       have admin privilege.

111    Failed to create share X on server Y using local path Z. Verify the
       server is up and running. The SMS service account must exist on the
       server and has the same password as the site server, and the service
       account must have admin privilege.

112    Failed to create mac volume X on server Y using local path Z. Verify
       the server is up and running. The SMS service account must exist on
       the server and has the same password as the site server, and the
       service account must have admin privilege.

113    There isn't any NTFS drive on server X, which is needed by the
       despooler to decompress or install the package.

114    Failed to decompress package X to Y. Verify there is enough disk
       space on the destination drive.

115    Failed to store the compressed package as X. Verify there is enough
       disk space on the SMS site installation drive.

116    Failed to perform replication on server X. Please check various
       inbox settings for this server in the site server registry. Please
       also check if this server is on the network. If the server is an
       OS/2 1.3 LanMan server, this could be that the local NT machine has
       already used up the two sessions that allowed to connect to an OS/2
       1.3 server. If the server is a NetWare machine, this could be that
       the NetWare server has run out of user connections.

117    Failed to detect the AppleTalk zone for SFM server X. This means
       SMS_INVENTORY_AGENT_NT on that server hasn't been started or failed
       to find that server's AppleTalk zone. Verify AppleTalk service is
       running on that server.
