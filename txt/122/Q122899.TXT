-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run The Microsoft Hearts Network under Windows NT, you may not be able
to use the networking features. You cannot be the dealer or connect to another
game.

NOTE: This problem only happens if you use the Windows for Workgroups version
3.11 MSHEARTS.EXE.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Hearts Network that came with Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
attempts to call the NDDEGetWindow function in NDDEAPI.DLL. This function is not
included with the version of NDDEAPI.DLL that came with Windows NT. Also, since
the NDDEAPI.DLL is a Win32 dynamic link library (DLL), the call would fail since
The Microsoft Hearts Network is a 16-bit application.


WORKAROUND
==========

Replace MSHEARTS.EXE with the version that came with Windows for Workgroups
version 3.10 and the networking functionality of The Microsoft Hearts Network
will return.
