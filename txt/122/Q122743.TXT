The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

You cannot create mirrored text directly in PowerPoint. However, you can use
Microsoft WordArt to create a graphic image of text that you can mirror using
the Rotate Or Flip command.

WordArt does not ship with PowerPoint 3.0. However, if you have WordArt installed
on your computer, you can use a similar technique in PowerPoint 3.0. In
PowerPoint 3.0 the Rotate/Flip command is located on the Object menu.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create mirrored text with WordArt, follow tehse steps:

1. On the Insert menu, click Object.

2. In the list of available objects, click Microsoft WordArt 2.0.

3. In the Enter Your Text Here box, type the text or character you want
   mirrored. You can also select the font and size you want from the toolbar.

4. Click outside the text area. This returns you to your PowerPoint slide.

5. If you want to change the size of the text, click Scale on the Draw menu.

6. On the Draw menu, click Ungroup. Click OK when you see the following
   message:

   This is an imported object, not a group. Converting it to a PowerPoint object
   will permanently discard any embedded data or linking information it may
   contain. Convert to PowerPoint Object?

7. Each letter is selected individually. At this point you have two options:
   either flip each letter in order or flip all the text. If you want to flip
   all the text, click Group on the Draw menu.

8. To mirror the text, click Rotate/Flip on the Draw menu (in PowerPoint 3.0,
   the Object menu). Click Flip Horizontal.

You will see a mirror image of your text.

NOTE: When you ungroup a WordArt object, it becomes a picture. WordArt can no
longer edit it.
