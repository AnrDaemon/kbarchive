The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under Windows NT version 3.5, if you format a paragraph as Justified and print
it with a PostScript driver, the words on a line with large spaces between them
may incorrectly have spaces between the letters in the word, instead of between
the words.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem on printers that are capable of both PostScript and
Hewlett-Packard (HP) PCL, use an HP PCL printer driver.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Windows NT Server version 3.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest
U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.5. For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
(without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K
