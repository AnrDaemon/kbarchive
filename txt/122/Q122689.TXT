TITLE   :PC DirSync: IMPORT.EXE Hangs When Processing Corrupt RESYNC.GLB
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Import program (IMPORT.EXE) may stop responding (hang) when it tries to
process a RESYNC.GLB file that contains invalid entries and may report the
following error

   Error [ 081] Error Message #81 is not defined <NAME>
   <NET>/<PO>

where <NAME> is the friendly name of the group, <NET> is the network
name and <PO> is the name of the postoffice.

IMPORT.EXE may hang when it attempts to process several such errors in the
RESYNC.GLB file.

CAUSE
=====

In the GROUP.GLB file, a TID value for a group that points to an invalid entry
in the ADMIN.NME will cause IMPORT.EXE to generate the above error, or may lock
the computer running IMPORT.EXE, requiring the PC to be rebooted.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 3.20 freeze
