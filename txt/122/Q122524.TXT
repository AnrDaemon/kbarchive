When running Windows NT 3.5 on a DEC Alpha 2100 with a Compaq QVision video
adapter installed, you may experience random video problems, such as a blue
cast which affects the entire desktop. The blue cast occurs randomly in
systems with fast processors (like the Alpha 2100), and is caused by a
timing problem on the Compaq QVision adapter.

System performance is not affected. Only the video is distorted. You might
be able to work around the problem by loading the 256 color bitmap.
However, this is a temporary workaround, and the random problems are likely
to persist. The only resolution is to replace the adapter. (Note: Since not
all Compaq QVision adapters have this problem, simply replacing the adapter
with a new one may resolve the problem).
