TITLE   :Minimized Excel Workbooks Disappear When Resizing the Window
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95 appscomp kbAppCompatibility

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you resize a Microsoft Excel 5.0 window containing a minimized workbook (or
more than one) to a shorter vertical height, the minimized workbook is hidden
from view.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Windows 95 uses a different method of icon control
when sizing windows. This causes the minimized workbook icon to remain at the
same x-y coordinate instead of being relocated to the bottom edge of the resized
window.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, click Arrange Icons on the Window menu. This places
the icons at the bottom edge of the window. And, they remain there when you
resize the window again.
