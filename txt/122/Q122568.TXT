The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade to Windows NT version 3.5 without using floppy disks on a
COMPAQ DESKPRO XL series computer, the following STOP message may appear:

   STOP 0x0000007B
   Inaccessible Boot Device

This message appears when you attempt to install Windows NT with the /b parameter
and you specify the COMPAQ SSD driver disk (SSD v1.12 - SP0925.EXE) for the
computer components.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do not use the /b parameter when you install
Windows NT version 3.5 from a server. Run WINNT.EXE or WINNT32.EXE without any
parameters; this requires three blank, formatted floppy disks.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

The Compaq products discussed here are manufactured by Compaq Computer Corp., a
vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
