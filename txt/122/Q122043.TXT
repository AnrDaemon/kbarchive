-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you disconnect from the Gateway Service for NetWare in Windows NT version
3.5, an "Access Denied" message appears when you attempt to connect to a NetWare
resource with a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) name from the NetWare network
service.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because NetWare limits accounts to a single session per user
account and when you disconnect from the Gateway Service for NetWare, the
service is stopped but the network connection remains with the NetWare server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Windows NT Server version 3.5. This problem was corrected in the latest U.S.
Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.5. For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
