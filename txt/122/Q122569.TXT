SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Systems Management Server, when Application Control (APPCTL) runs
out of memory trying to allocate a buffer space to determine which user groups a
user belongs to, the following error message may appear:

   Failed to connect to SMS network server. Cannot determine which user groups
   the user belongs to.

In addition, if the same behavior occurs during the logon process, APPCTL
displays a dialog box with the same error message every 15 minutes until the
allocation of a buffer space is successful.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
