TITLE   :Xircom PCMCIA Ethernet Card Fails to Initialize in WFWG
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Xircom Ethernet or Ethernet+Fax cards on some PCMCIA-equipped devices do not
work correctly with Windows for Workgroups. Although the drivers appear to load
successfully, the card fails to initialize and therefore you cannot communicate
with the network.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the Netcard= setting in the [Network Drivers] section
of your SYSTEM.INI file points to either CECFG.EXE (for the Ethernet card) or
CEMCFG.EXE (for the Ethernet+Modem card)or CE2CFG.EXE (for the Xircom Credit
Card Ethernet Adaptor IIps). The Xircom card will fail the NET DIAG test with
these drivers present. If you are using these files and cannot access your
network, it means the PCMCIA controller hardware and the card and socket service
software are incompatible under Windows for Workgroups.

This problem does not affect all hardware and software combinations under Windows
for Workgroups, so the problem does not occur with all Xircom PCMCIA products.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove the CECFG.EXE, CE2CFG.EXE, or CEMCFG.EXE
filename from the Netcard= line in the [Network Drivers] section of your
SYSTEM.INI file.
