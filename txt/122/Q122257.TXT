SUMMARY
=======

The online Help for compiler error C2712 ("cannot use __try in func with object
unwinding") states:

   To avoid this error message, compile using /GX option.

This is incorrect. It should read that the workaround is to compile with /GX-,
which instructs the compiler to disable C++ exception handling unwinding.
