TITLE   :Foreign NAD Items Remain After Child Detaches
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbDatabase smsdatabase

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a child site detaches from a parent site, any packages or program groups
defined at the parent site exist and are preserved on the child site.

WORKAROUND
==========

After a child site detaches from a parent, you may want to remove the previous
parent site's network applications database (NAD) from the child. Removal of the
parent's NAD does not automatically occur because of the potentially dramatic
effect it could have on client machines (program groups and program items being
removed) even though access to these items may still exist.

To initiate a transaction in the Systems Management Server Applications Manager,
use the following procedure, run the NADRESET.BAT file in the PSSTOOLS directory
on the CD. This file performs the following steps:

 - Creates a 10000000.NAD directory in <SMSROOT>\SITE.SRV\SITECFG.BOX.

 - Creates a TRANSLOG.CLR file in the 10000000.NAD directory.

 - Creates an ALL.RST file in the 10000000.NAD directory.

NOTE: 10000000.NAD is used only because it is unlikely that a directory with the
same name exists. Any name can be used with the NAD extension.

The next polling interval for the Applications Manager removes foreign NAD items.
There will be a period of time before the changes are propagated to the
MAINCFG.BOX\APPCTL.SRC\DATABASE directory. Following this processing, the files
created in the list above are automatically removed by the Applications Manager.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
