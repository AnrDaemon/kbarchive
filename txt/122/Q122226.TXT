SUMMARY
=======

The dialog editor in the Visual C++ development environment selects multiple
controls only if they are completely enclosed in the selection box. You can
modify this behavior to include controls partially outside the selection box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To change the selection method in the dialog editor, modify the Windows NT
registry using Regedt32.exe or Regedit.exe. (There is no user interface option
for this feature in the development environment.) First close Visual C++. Then
use Regedt32.exe or Regedit.exe to select the Dialog Editor key.

For Visual C++, version 2.0, this key can be found as follows:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Visual C++ 2.0\Dialog Editor

For Visual C++, version 4.0, the Dialog Editor key can be found as follows:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Developer\Dialog Editor

For Visual C++, version 5.0, the Dialog Editor key can be found as follows:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\DevStudio\5.0\DialogEditor

For Visual C++, version 6.0, the Dialog Editor key can be found as follows:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\DevStudio\6.0\DialogEditor

Modify the value of NetSelectAll from 0 to 1 to enable selection of the partially
covered controls.

REFERENCES
