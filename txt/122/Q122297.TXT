 - Microsoft LAN Manager, version 2.2c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

MS-DOS - based computers without Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
must install an MS-DOS client to access Windows NT servers. The Windows NT
Server version 3.5 CD-ROM includes two MS-DOS clients in the CLIENTS directory:

 - Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS, version 3.0

 - Microsoft LAN Manager for MS-DOS, version 2.2c

Microsoft Network Client version 3.0 replaces Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for
MS-DOS and Microsoft Workgroup Connection. It is the preferred MS-DOS client,
except for remoteboot configurations. Microsoft will continue to make the
Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS available for customers who want its file
and print server capabilities.


This article discusses the key differences between these two MS-DOS - based
clients, to assist users in selecting the appropriate client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Both clients include basic and full redirectors. The full redirectors are faster
and provide more functions, but they use more memory and disk space.

System Requirements
-------------------

Both clients have the following minimum requirements:

 - Intel 8088 or higher processor (80286 for full redirectors)

 - 640 kilobytes (K) RAM

 - 1 megabyte (MB) free hard disk space

 - Supported network interface card

 - MS-DOS version 3.3 or higher

 - Windows version 3.1x is optional (should not be used with Windows for
   Workgroups)

Clients that have additional requirements are annotated in the following
sections.

Identical TCP/IP on Both Clients
--------------------------------

The same TCP/IP binaries ship with both MS-DOS - based clients. These MS- DOS -
based clients provide Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) client support,
WINS resolution, and Windows Sockets support. However, they do not have the
following features that are provided by TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11 and Windows NT Server and Workstation version 3.5:

 - Support DNS resolution using WINS.

 - Support WINS resolution using DNS.

 - Name registration with the WINS database. (MS-DOS -based computers are
   clients, not servers, and do not generally need registration.)

 - Act as a WINS proxy node.

 - Have multihomed support.

 - Support IGMP.

 - DHCP command-line switches for the IPCONFIG command. (Must use the DHCP
   Administration Utility instead.)

Microsoft Network Client Version 3.0
------------------------------------

Microsoft has optimized this client to work with Windows NT version 3.5 servers,
and will be the focus of future development efforts for MS-DOS - based clients
for Windows NT.

This client includes MS-DOS TCP/IP, MS-IPX, NetBEUI and Microsoft DLC protocols.
Both full and basic redirectors can load any three of these four protocols.

This client is faster and easier to install than LAN Manager for MS-DOS version
2.2c, even when you upgrade from a previous version of the LAN Manager client.

Over-the-network installation onto a clean MS-DOS - based computer is available
for this client through Windows NT Server's Network Client Administrator.

This client is derived from the Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS version 3.11 product,
but does not include the following:

 - MS-Mail client

 - Real mode server (that is, it cannot share files)

Full redirector

 - Required if using Microsoft Windows or Remote Access Service (RAS)

 - Supports LAN Manager APIs, including domain logons

 - Uses 88K RAM, plus memory for protocols

 - Requires Intel 80286 or later processor

 - Is the default redirector

Basic redirector

 - Supports connecting to shared files and printers

 - Uses 10K RAM, plus memory for protocols

 - Required for 8088 processors

This client does not support RemoteBoot.

This client does not support SPX, nor asynchronous-named pipes when the client is
running Windows in enhanced mode. It does support all other client APIs,
including NetBIOS, TCP/IP, and IPX.

This client does not provide a Browse Master. In order to browse the network, a
computer running Windows for Workgroups or Windows NT must be on the network and
belong to the same workgroup as the computer running Network Client.

This client only supports the inventory capabilities of Microsoft Systems
Management Server version 1.0. This limitation is due to a restriction in the
NetBIOS interface. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE : Network Client Support for Systems Management Server


Microsoft LAN Manager for MS-DOS, Version 2.2c
----------------------------------------------

This client adds DHCP and WINS client support and bug fixes to the LAN Manager
version 2.2b client. This client does not provide any advantages over Microsoft
Network Client, except for its RemoteBoot capability.

This client includes MS-DOS TCP/IP, NetBEUI, and Microsoft DLC protocols. A
NetWare Connectivity disk is also available.

This client does not support over-the-network installation.

There is no automatic upgrade available from an earlier version of LAN Manager
for this client. Users must save configuration information for reference
purposes, remove the earlier version, and then install version 2.2c.

This client supports RemoteBoot.

Full redirector

 - Allows multiple protocols and adapters on one computer

 - Uses 100K RAM, plus memory for protocols

 - Requires 4 MB disk space

 - Supports named pipes

Basic redirector

 - Uses 59K RAM, plus memory for protocols

 - Allows single protocol and adapter on one computer
