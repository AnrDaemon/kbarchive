SUMMARY
=======

This article provides an overview of The Magic School Bus Explores the Human
Body.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Imagine your teacher is taking you on a field trip, and one of the kids doesn't
want to go. That's what happens to Arnold; he's left behind eating his lunch at
a picnic table in the park while the rest of the class boards the bus and drives
away. But Arnold doesn't miss anything - instead of taking him on a field trip
the Friz (your teacher, Ms. Frizzle), makes him into one!! She shrinks the bus
down to the size of a snack cracker and Arnold swallows the bus (and you), right
along with his Cheese Weezies.

No lie! With the Friz, this stuff happens! So get ready for the ride of your
life!

Yes, you have been swallowed by Arnold and the only way to escape is by exploring
his entire body! You'll need to visit 12 different body parts before you know
enough to find your way out.

While you're exploring, be sure to check out Ralphie's video games, and listen to
what each kid has to say in the back of the bus. Some of your classmates have
written reports about the human body, and there are some very cool fact sheets
and science experiments hidden on the bus.

Don't forget that map in your glove compartment! Keep checking it to see where
you've visited and where you still need to go.

After you've explored all 12 body parts and the map is complete, go to one of the
three body parts from which you can exit Arnold. From there, click on the
keyhole that's in the bus.

Watch what escapes from the keyhole. Click on it, and then click on the
windshield. Out you go! You've escaped from Arnold's body.

The Magic School Bus Explores the Human Body is designed for kids of all ages,
especially those age 6-10. The program is based on a series of books from
Scholastic publishing, one of the leading publishers of children's books. In
addition to the books, The Magic School Bus Explores the Human Body is also
being marketed in conjunction with a Magic School Bus animated series on PBS
(Public Broadcasting System) and McDonald's Happy Meals.
