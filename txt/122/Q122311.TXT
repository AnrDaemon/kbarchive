SUMMARY
=======

Rumba Mainframe version 4.1 works with Microsoft TCP/IP-32. You can obtain a
patch from Wall Data to use the other versions of Rumba with TCP/IP-32.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are the current versions of Rumba:

   Rumba Office 1.0
   Rumba Mainframe 4.1
   Rumba AS/400 2.0
   Rumba VAX 1.0 update 02

Rumba Mainframe version 4.1 works with TCP/IP-32. All of the other versions of
Rumba require a patch from Wall Data to allow you to configure Rumba for Windows
Sockets version 1.1, which is required to run Rumba with TCP/IP-32.

If you are using another version of Rumba without the patch, there is no option
to configure Rumba for Windows Sockets within the Rumba interface. Once you
apply the patch, there is an option to configure Rumba for Windows Sockets on
the Options menu, by choosing Interface and then Configure.

To obtain the patch, call Wall Data at (206) 814-9255.

The Rumba products discussed here are manufactured by Wall Data, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.
