======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error is displayed when you run Setup on a system with a SCSI
device that is not a hard disk drive and is set to ID 0 or ID 1:

   Setup is unable to identify your hard drive's startup partition.

CAUSE
=====

SCSI ID 0 and ID 1 are reserved for SCSI hard disks. Setup treats devices
mounted as SCSI ID 1 or ID 0 as hard disk devices. The device given ID 0 or ID 1
does not respond as appropriate, generating the above error message.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, reconfigure the device to ID 2 or higher and then
rerun Setup.
