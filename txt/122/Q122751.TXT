-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2, 3.2a, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message may appear in the DIRSYNC.LOG file on a postoffice:

   Error [ 44] Gateway not installed: <Gateway Name>

Where the <Gateway Name> can be PROFS, SNADS, SMTP, X.400, or any other
gateway product.

CAUSE
=====

This error message will most often occur on a directory synchronization
(Dir-Sync) requestor postoffice on which the gateway identified by the error
message is not installed. In most cases, this error message is caused by the
Import program (IMPORT.EXE) performing a resynchronization procedure against a
RESYNC.GLB file. Generally, the IMPORT.EXE process deletes the RESYNC.GLB file
after successful completion and this error message will not occur again. If this
is the case, you can safely ignore this error message.

If the administrator of the Dir-Sync server postoffice creates a RESYNC.GLB file,
and this Dir-Sync server has one or more gateway or gateway access components
installed, this RESYNC.GLB file will contain gateway address information. When
this RESYNC.GLB file is copied to the GLB directory of a requestor postoffice
that does not have the gateway access component(s) installed, and IMPORT.EXE is
then run, this error message will appear.

The IMPORT.EXE command line parameters causing this error message will very
likely be:

   import admin -ppassword -d<drive> -q
