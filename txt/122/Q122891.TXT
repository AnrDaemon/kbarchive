The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

WINMSD fails to display values or displays corrupted values for some fields in a
screen. For example, after choosing the Memory button, the values for Total
Physical Memory, Available Physical Memory, and others are blank or corrupted.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when Windows NT is set to a language other than
"English(American)." The language setting can be configured from the
International section in Control Panel.

RESOLUTION
==========

Currently, there is no resolution. As a workaround, you can temporarily change
the language to "English(American)" when you want to use WINMSD.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
