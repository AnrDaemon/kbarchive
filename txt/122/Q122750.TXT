TITLE   :PC DirSync: Files to Check If IMPORT.EXE Does Not Complete
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While the last step (T3) of directory synchronization (Dir-Sync) is being
performed on a Microsoft Mail for PC Networks postoffice, the Import program
(IMPORT.EXE) may fail with an error message in the DIRSYNC.LOG file, indicating
a problem with one of the transaction files.

CAUSE
=====

When Dir-Sync processes are NOT actively being performed against a postoffice,
the following files, located in the GLB subdirectory, should all be zero bytes
in length:

   USRTRANS.GLB
   NMETRANS.GLB
   GWTRANS.GLB
   SRVTRANS.GLB

Likewise, the following files should not exist at all in the GLB subdirectory if
Dir-Sync is NOT being performed against a postoffice:

   IUSRTRAN.GLB
   INMETRAN.GLB
   IGWTRANS.GLB
   SRVUPDS.GLB
   REQUPDS.GLB
   SORTxxxx.GLB (where xxxx is a number)
   ILOCAL.GLB
   INDEX.GLB

On occasion, because of network or other problems, IMPORT.EXE will not complete
successfully (logging an error message in the DIRSYNC.LOG file). While Dir-Sync
is NOT actively occurring, you may find one or more of the files that should be
zero bytes in length will actually have some size (greater than zero).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, try the following options:

1. Run IMPORT.EXE against the postoffice and see if the Import process will
   successfully complete:

   import admin -p<password> -y -q -d<drive_letter>

2. If IMPORT.EXE fails again, zero out the file(s) that have a size greater than
   zero bytes, with the MS-DOS TYPE command

   type nul > <filename>

   where <filename> is SRVTRANS.GLB, USRTRANS.GLB, NMETRANS.GLB, or
   GWTRANS.GLB.

   If, while Dir-Sync is NOT being actively performed on a postoffice, any of the
   files that should not exist in the GLB subdirectory of the Mail database
   (listed above) actually do exist, you should delete those files.

Another file to check, which may occassionaly cause problems with the IMPORT.EXE
process, is the RESYNC.GLB. If a RESYNC.GLB file exists in the GLB subdirectory
of the postoffice and IMPORT.EXE with the -Q option does not properly process
this file (RESYNC.GLB should automatically be deleted from the GLB subdirectory
by IMPORT.EXE), the administrator should manually delete this file.
