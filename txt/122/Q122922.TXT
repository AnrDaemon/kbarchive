Page 30 of the Windows NT version 3.5 Hardware Compatibility List (HCL)
lists display adapters supported on DEC Alpha AXP systems. Page 31 of the
HCL states that "Display adapters not listed above are expected to work if
they use the following chipsets." This statement would suggest that the
table of chipsets and respective drivers found on page 31 are supported on
the Alpha systems. This is not the case. Page 31 of the Windows NT version
3.5 HCL is not in the correct location; the information on that page
applies only to x86-based systems.
