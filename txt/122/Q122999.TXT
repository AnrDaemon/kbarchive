KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you respond to a meeting request in Microsoft Mail for Windows that was
created in Schedule+ for Windows, the following error may occur:

   Schedule+ Messages: Schedule+ is not available for booking appointments. You
   can only send messages to respond to this meeting request.

CAUSE
=====

The following line appears in the [Microsoft Schedule+] section of the
SCHDPLUS.INI file:

   ScheduleTransport=TRNOFF

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the line to the following:

   ScheduleTransport=TRNSCHED.DLL

The TRNSCHED.DLL file should be located in the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.
Restart Schedule+; the problem should not reoccur.

If the TRNSCHED.DLL file is missing, it can usually be copied from another
workstation or expanded from the product disks. To do this, you need EXPAND.EXE,
which should be located in both the MS-DOS and Windows directories. Use the
following the syntax

   expand <drive>:\trnsched.dl_ <winpath>\trnsched.dll

where <drive> is the drive containing the installation disk and
<winpath> is the path to the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory. For example, if
the installation disk is in drive A and the Windows directory is C:\WINDOWS,
type the following command:

   expand a:\trnsched.dl_ c:\windows\system\trnsched.dll

The TRNSCHED.DLL file can be found in the following locations:
