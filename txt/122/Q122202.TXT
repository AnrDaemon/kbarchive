TITLE   :PCM and Archiving Unexecuted Mandatory Jobs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPCM smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When Package Command Manager (PCM) detects a mandatory job, it is possible for
someone to archive the job while the 5 minute countdown timer is still running.
If this happens, there are several resulting problems which prevent PCM from
being able to execute the job.

WORKAROUND
==========

If someone archives a mandatory job just before execution, delete the
PCMHIST.REG file on the client computer. This will force PCM to put the job into
the pending commands folder and re-enable the job for execution.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.0. This problem was corrected in Systems Management Server version
1.1.
