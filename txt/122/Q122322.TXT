TITLE   :Extra Characters Added to DNS Name Query

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform a NetBIOS name resolution using Domain Name Service (DNS) by
enabling the DNS for Windows Name Resolution option, Microsoft TCP/IP-32 adds an
extra character to a domain name if the domain name is exactly 15 characters in
length (including the period separating the name). For example, if the domain
name is "1.microsoft.com" (without quotes) and the host name is ABCD, the DNS
name query sent is "ABCD.1.microsoft.com.8" (without quotes). The extra
character that attaches to the end of the DNS name query is commonly the number
8 or the letter X, but can be any character. This behavior does not affect any
of the TCP/IP-32 utilities.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Create or use a domain name less or greater than 15 characters.

 - Create or use a local LMHOSTS file for the NetBIOS name resolution.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in TCP/IP-32 version 3.11a. A fix
to this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.
