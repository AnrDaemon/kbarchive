The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Visual C++ development environment will terminate a file load if there is a
CTRL+Z (1aH) character in the file.

RESOLUTION
==========

View the file in another editor, such as Microsoft Word, and remove the CTRL+Z
characters. In Microsoft Word, CTRL+Z characters appear as a square box. When
you save the file, be sure to save it in text format.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was fixed in Microsoft Visual C++,
32-bit Edition, version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

CTRL+Z is not used as the end-of-file character in Windows NT. This use of
CTRL+Z is obsolete and should be ignored.

Additional query words: 2.00 control-z ctrl-z ctrl z
