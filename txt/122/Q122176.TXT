TITLE   :SMS Site Reset Recommended Before Upgrade
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbConfig smshowto smsconfig

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft recommends that prior to attempting an upgrade of Systems
Management Server site server software, that you perform a Site Reset from
the SMS Setup program. This is intended to ensure that all service
components are properly responding to service control commands for stopping
and starting.

SYMPTOMS
========

During an upgrade of the Systems Management Server site server software, the
SMS_Executive service cannot be stopped and reports an error. The upgrade
fails.

One or more of the following symptoms may indicate that this is the problem:

 - Sometimes after a NET STOP SMS_EXECUTIVE command, Service Control Manager
   responds with "the service cannot be controlled."

 - Control Panel shows SMS_Executive is not running.

 - NET START shows SMS_Executive is running.

 - NET START SMS_EXECUTIVE results in:

   System error 1072 has occurred.
   The specified service has been marked for deletion.

 - There are many new temporary (.TMP) files in the root of the site drive that
   can't be deleted.

WORKAROUND
==========

Shutdown and restart the Windows NT server, do a Systems Management Server Site
Reset, and then attempt to upgrade again. There is no way to stop the service
after it was uninstalled while running, other than a system shutdown. The reset
should clean up service problems. The upgrade should make sure all the correct
files have been replaced and the new settings are correctly entered.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
