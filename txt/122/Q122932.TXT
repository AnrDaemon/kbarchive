======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 2.0

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Visual C++ fails to open files that have .BSC or .RC extensions when
there are special characters (shown below) in the path. The editor will return
to the main window without posting a warning or error.

CAUSE
=====

The space character and the following characters cause this problem:

   $  %  @  #  !  ^  (  )  {  }  [  ]

All of these characters should work; they are all acceptable.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, avoid using any of the special characters listed
above.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++,
version 4.0.
