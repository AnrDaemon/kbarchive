TITLE   :Scheduler Overwrites Package Property Information
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbDatabase kbScheduler smsdatabase smsscheduler

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After Scheduler processes a job on a package, the package information is written
back into the original database overwriting any changes that were made to the
package properties by the Administrator.

For example, when the Scheduler reads and compresses a package, it may take a
long period of time, depending on the size of the package. During the same time,
the Administrator may be changing the properties of the package. This
information is overwritten when Scheduler completes the process.

CAUSE
=====


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
