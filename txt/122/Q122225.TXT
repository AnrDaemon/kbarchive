TITLE   :Sub-directory and File Permissions Not Set on Macintosh Volume
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsmsAdmin smsadmin

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When Microsoft Systems Management Server creates a Macintosh volume (SMS_SHR for
example), it does not create file-level permissions for any sub-directories.
This results in Macintosh systems having write privileges for the
LOGON.SRV\MAC.BIN and other sub-directories.

CAUSE
=====

The SMS_MAINTENANCE_MANAGER service does not set the Macintosh file permissions
on the ..\LOGON.SRV directory on servers where Windows NT Services for Macintosh
have been installed. Macintosh directory permissions (which are similar but not
the same as Windows NT file and directory permissions) default to write access
on ..\LOGON.SRV and its sub- directories. This creates a security leak, since
some user could replace executable files in the ".BIN" directories.

WORKAROUND
==========

Once the Macintosh volume is created by the SMS_SITE_CONFIG_MANAGER service, the
SMS_MAINTENANCE_MANANGER service ignores permissions if it updates these
directories during the normal maintenance cycle. This allows the Systems
Management Server administrator to configure the sub-directory and file
permissions manually to deny Macintosh users write privileges.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
