SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade to Windows NT version 3.5 with any of the Intelligent
Digiboard adapters, more than one of the following events may appear in the
Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 4103 Source: ntxall Type: Information
   Description: Overriding current configuration to use 8K memory mapped window
   on ntxall<a>.

   Event ID: 25 Source: Serial Type: Error
   Description: User configuration for parameter ntxall<a>Line<b>
   Concentrator<c>Port<d> must have PortAddress.

where: <a> is order number of installed adapters in Windows NT (usually 2
if a network adapter was installed first on this computer) <b> is the line
number used on the Digiboard adapter (usually 1) <c> is the concentrator
number used on the Digiboard adapter (usually 1) <d> is the number of each
port configured on the Digiboard adapter.

CAUSE
=====

The ntxall subkey in the Windows NT Registry should reside under the Services
subkey of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet for all intelligent
Digiboard adapters. Any subkeys residing under the Parameters subkey of
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Serial are port
configurations for non-intelligent Digiboard adapters and any additional
communication ports. This problem occurs after the upgrade process where a copy
of the ntxall subkey tree was placed under the Parameters subkey.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent these events from appearing in the Event Viewer, modify the Windows
NT Registry.

   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
   problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
   Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
   Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start REGEDT32.EXE and locate the following Registry subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet \Services\Serial\Parameters

2. Remove all subkeys below and including ntxall<a>.

3. Exit the Registry Editor.

4. Shut down and restart Windows NT.
