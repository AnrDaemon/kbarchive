SUMMARY
=======

This article lists the steps necessary to enable extended capabilities port
(ECP) support in Microsoft Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Consult your hardware manual to determine the IRQ and DMA settings for the
   ECP port(s) you want to use. (This information is required to enable ECP
   support.)

2. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

3. Double-click the System icon.

   NOTE: You can skip steps 2 and 3 if you click the My Computer icon on the
   desktop with the right (secondary) mouse button and then click Properties.

4. Click the Device Manager tab, then double-click Ports (COM & LPT).

5. Double-click the Extended Capabilities Port (ECP).

   NOTE: This port appears only if Windows 95 detected it.

6. Click the Resources tab, then click Basic Configuration 2 in the Setting
   Based On field.

   NOTE: See below for a description of the basic configuration settings for
   extended capabilities ports.

7. Change the IRQ and DMA values to whatever you have the ECP set to, and make
   sure that the "No devices are conflicting" message appears in the Conflicting
   Devices List.

   NOTE: If you have multiple ECP ports, you must repeat the above steps to
   configure the DMA and IRQ values of each port.

8. Click OK until you are prompted to shut down your computer.

9. Shut down your computer and then restart it.

An extended capabilities port has five possible configurations (0 through 4):

 - Basic Configuration 0 Standard I/O ranges for LPT ports only

 - Basic Configuration 1 Standard I/O ranges for LPT ports and any IRQ setting

 - Basic Configuration 2 Standard I/O ranges for LPT ports, any IRQ setting, and
   any DMA setting

 - Basic Configuration 3 Any I/O ranges for LPT ports only

 - Basic Configuration 4 Any I/O ranges for LPT ports and any IRQ setting
