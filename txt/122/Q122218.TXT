======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, 16-bit edition, versions 1.5, 1.51 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 2.0, 2.1, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.2b, 5.0, 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++.NET (2002) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the RFX_Date() functions in the Microsoft Foundation Classes fails to work
with date/time fields with some ODBC drivers. A general ODBC error or 'invalid
precision' error may occur depending upon the ODBC driver.

CAUSE
=====

RFX_Date() calls SQLSetParam() and SQLBindCol() with a precision parameter equal
to 23 (sizeof TIMESTAMP_STRUCT). Some ODBC drivers may not use the same
precision for a SQL_TIMESTAMP. For example, some ODBC drivers may choose ignore
seconds or fractions of a second; in these cases, the precision may be smaller.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, you must re-write the RFX_Date() function and call
your new function in your CRecordset's DoFieldExchange(), replacing the
RFX_Date() call.

In your new RFX_Date() function you will need to:

1. Get the precision of a SQL_TIMESTAMP column by using the ODBC function
   SQLGetTypeInfo() for the data source connected to by the CRecordset.

2. Store the precision value in a variable in your recordset so that you can
   retrieve it later.

3. Replace all references of TIMESTAMP_PRECISION in your RFX_Date() function
   with a reference to the precision variable contained in your CRecordset
   class.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
