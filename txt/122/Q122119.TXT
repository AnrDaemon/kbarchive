MORE INFORMATION

   as a part of the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Setup or through the Add/Remove
   Components option available when you choose the Windows Setup icon.

   file storage and connections between post offices. Windows for Workgroups

   automatically when Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Schedule+ runs.

   using a data-transfer program that communicates with multiple Mail 3.0 post
   offices. Windows for Workgroups 3.11 does not provide this functionality.

   users.
