TITLE   :DriveSpace Err Msg After Installing over PC-DOS 6.1 or 6.3
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to run the DriveSpace utility from MS-DOS 6.22 after upgrading from
PC-DOS version 6.1 or 6.3, the following error message is displayed:

   Your computer is running an incompatible version of the DRVSPACE.BIN file.
   You must update DRVSPACE.BIN on the root directory of your drive.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because the compression driver that IBM ships with versions
6.1 and 6.3 of PC-DOS is incompatible with DriveSpace.

MS-DOS 6.22 Setup runs correctly because the compression is not on the boot
drive. Setup completes with no data loss; however, if you then try to run
DriveSpace to convert the compressed drive, the above error message occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========

You must copy the original PC-DOS DoubleSpace files back to the host drive, back
up the data, reformat the host drive to remove compression, and then restore the
data.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The README.TXT from MS-DOS version 6.22, section 1.17 recommends that PC-DOS
users remove disk compression before upgrading.
