PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdocfix kbdocerr kbCompiler kbCPPonly kbVC

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Quick Reference Help and Books Online both state that the
_set_se_translator() and set_terminate() functions return a pointer to their
argument. In fact, they return a pointer to the previous translator or terminate
function respectively.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was fixed in the documentation of
Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0.

documentation. For the _set_se_translator help or Books Online:
