-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows 95 does not provide specific drivers for the following display
adapters:

 - RGDI (Renaissance Graphics Device Interface)

 - DGIS (Direct Graphics Interface Standard)

 - TIGA

When Setup is detecting the installed hardware, it detects these cards as
VGA. If you were using a video driver for one of these cards in a previous
version of Windows and you are performing an upgrade, Setup keeps the video
driver you were using. If you are performing a new installation, Setup
installs the standard VGA driver.

Windows 95 can use the standard VGA driver or the Windows 3.1 drivers for
these display adapters.
