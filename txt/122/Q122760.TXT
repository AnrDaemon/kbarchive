The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2

SUMMARY
=======

In version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the private folders can be
expanded or collapsed. When the folders are fully expanded, the parent level
folders show a minus sign (-), indicating they can be collapsed. When collapsed,
the symbol turns to a plus sign (+).

Shared folders in Mail for Windows cannot be manipulated like the private folders
because the shared folder hierarchy can be changed by any of the Mail for PC
Networks workstations (Mail for PC Networks, Macintosh workstation; Mail for PC
Networks, OS/2 workstation; or Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation).
Because there was no easy way to track the expanded status of the folders at the
client level, it was decided not to be included in any future releases or
enhancements of version 3.2x of Mail for Windows.


Additional query words: 3.20
