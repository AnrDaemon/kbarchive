SYMPTOMS
========

If you do not provide the Windows directory and the destination during a manual
installation of Encarta 1995, the following error message is displayed

   There is not enough environment space to create temporary variables

and the batch file terminates.

CAUSE
=====

The MANUAL.BAT file is checking for a SYSPATH environment variable that does not
exist.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set the SYSPATH variable before you enter the manual command by typing the
following at the MS-DOS command prompt:

   "set syspath=c:" (without the quotation marks)

Now, typing "MANUAL.BAT" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command
prompt by itself works correctly. It decompresses and copies the drivers,
dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), and other files to the C:\ENCFILES directory. No
files are written to the syspath, so it does not matter which directory is
specified.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The manual setup files are located in the following directory

     <x>:\aamsstp\manual

where <x> is the CD-ROM drive letter.

MSETUP.TXT is a text file that provides the description of how to run MANUAL.BAT.
