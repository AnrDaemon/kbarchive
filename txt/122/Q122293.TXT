KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Your computer running Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 with TCP/IP-32
intermittently stops responding (hangs) for about 20 seconds at a time.

This occurs if TCP/IP-32 is installed as a non-default network protocol and the
Enable LMHOSTS Lookup option in Network Setup is checked.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you do not need to access network servers over a router, you can work around
this problem by clearing the Enable LMHOSTS Lookup check box in Network Setup.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has released a new version of VNBT.386 corrects this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in TCP/IP-32. This problem has been
corrected in an updated TCP/IP-32 version 3.11a. For information on the
availability of TCP/IP-32 3.11a, see article Q122544 in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base.
