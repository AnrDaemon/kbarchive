SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the purpose of the WINSOCK.DLL file and how to obtain it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

What Is WINSOCK.DLL?
--------------------

WINSOCK.DLL is a dynamic-link library that provides a common application
programming interface (API) for developers of network applications that use the
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) stack.

This means that a programmer who develops a Windows-based TCP/IP application,
such as an FTP or Telenet client, can write one program that works with any
TCP/IP protocol stack that provides Windows Socket Services (WINSOCK.DLL).

Other applications that depend on a Windows Socket provider include Eudora (a
mail package) and Mosaic (a browser for the Internet World Wide Web).

Where Can I Get WINSOCK.DLL?
----------------------------

WINSOCK.DLL is shipped with TCP/IP network protocol stacks that are Windows
Socket compliant. A WINSOCK.DLL file developed for one implementation of TCP/IP
may not necessarily work with another TCP/IP stack.

Microsoft includes a WINSOCK.DLL file with its TCP/IP stacks for Windows for
Workgroups and Windows NT Workstation and Server.

Where Can I Get More Information about WINSOCK.DLL?
---------------------------------------------------

Specifications for the Microsoft implementation of the Winsock standard are
available on Microsoft's Internet server (ftp:\\microsoft.com).
