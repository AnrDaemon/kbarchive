MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microcom 14,400 ES Deskporte fax modem is both Class 1 and Class 2
compatible. Without the above SetupCommand entry, either you cannot send faxes
at all, or you can send one fax only. This depends on the class to which the fax
modem is set.

 - If the Microcom 14400 is set up to be a Class 1 fax modem, you cannot send
   any faxes.

 - If the Microcom 14400 is set up to be a Class 2 fax modem, you can send one
   fax only.

To find the class of the fax modem, open the EFAXPUMP.INI file in Microsoft Write
and choose No Conversion. The fax modem class is designated by the following
EFAXPUMP.INI entry

   FixModemClass=<y>

where <y> designates the class of the fax modem.
