SUMMARY

This article contains a list of PCMCIA card sizes and types.

Physical Specifications
-----------------------

PCMCIA cards have one of the following standard physical dimensions:

Type I Card         54 mm by 85.6 mm by 3.3 mm
Type II Card        54 mm by 85.6 mm by 5 mm
Type III Card       54 mm by 85.6 mm by 10.5 mm

The PCMCIA card size is the same as a standard credit card except for thickness
and corner rounding. Sometimes PCMCIA cards are referred to as credit-card
memory or adapters.

Certain Toshiba notebook computers and other machines have a non-standard,
oversized slot for which there are non-standard, oversized cards ranging from
14.5 millimeter (mm) to 16 mm (or more) thick. These cards and slots are
sometimes incorrectly referred to as "Type IV." This size card will probably not
become part of the PCMCIA standard.

A Type II card has the same thickness as a Type I card along the long sides and
connector end; this provides mechanical compatibility. A bubble 0.85 mm thick on
the top and bottom surfaces increases the card's total thickness to 5 mm. A Type
III card has a additional 5.5 mm on the top surface bubble for a total thickness
of 10.5 mm.

The standard allows a maximum card length of 135.6 mm, which means the card can
extend outside the host. This accommodates bulky devices such as batteries,
oversized connectors, removable media, transceivers, and the antenna required by
some devices.
