KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to save a modified Schedule+ file, you receive the following error
message:

   Your schedule file is locked

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused by a read-only attribute on the local calendar file (.CAL),
the calendar file on the server, or incorrect access settings on the Workgroup
post office (WGPO) server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, try the following methods:

 - In File Manager, connect to the Mail Server directory and check the
   attributes on the .CAL files in the CAL directory. If any are set to
   Read-Only, remove that attribute and select the Archive attribute.

 - In File Manager, connect the Mail server WGPO directory. Copy a file to this
   directory. If you receive an Access Denied error, the WGPO directory is set
   to Read-Only. Contact the system administrator for proper access privileges.

 - In File Manager, change the read-only attributes on the .CAL files located in
   the Windows directory to Archive.

NOTE: You may need to use more than one of the above methods to correct this
problem.
