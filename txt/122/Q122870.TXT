SUMMARY
=======

Chili Pepper Software Infinite Disk versions 2.1 and earlier are incompatible
with Windows for Workgroups 32-bit file access. Activating 32- bit file access
in Windows for Workgroups while running Infinite Disk may corrupt program and/or
data files on the hard disk drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Infinite Disk is a utility program designed to optimize disk space by monitoring
access of files and compressing those files that have not been accessed for a
given amount of time. The files are compressed and automatically "recalled"
(uncompressed) by Infinite Disk terminate-stay- resident programs (TSRs).
Infinite Disk allows you to indicate which files should be monitored for
compression and what amount of time should pass before a file is compressed.
