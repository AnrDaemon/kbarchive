TITLE   :Video for Windows Conflicts with Diamond VideoStar Board
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Video for Windows, version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a Diamond VideoStar video capture board and the Diamond video
driver version 1.02, Microsoft Video for Windows fails to capture frames and
then displays the following incorrect error message:

   Confirm that vertical sync interrupts are configured and enabled.

CAUSE
=====

The Diamond VideoStar board works with Video for Windows unless Video for
Windows is in preview video mode. This limitation is not mentioned in the
Diamond VideoStar documentation.

WORKAROUND
==========

In Video for Windows, switch to a view other than preview video mode before you
capture a frame.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Below is a list of other potential problems with the VideoStar card that
although documented by Diamond may affect the operation of Video for Windows.

 - The switch settings for the port address of the daughter board (which enables
   video capture functionality) are mislabeled on the VideoStar card itself. You
   can find the correct settings in an insert supplied with the VideoStar
   documentation.

 - You must run the Diamond Video Snooper utility in the background while Video
   for Windows is running. If Video Snooper is not running, a "capture device
   not detected" error message is displayed.

 - Be sure to follow the instructions in your Diamond documentation regarding
   maximum screen refresh rates. Most modern computers default to faster refresh
   rates than the VideoStar supports. If the refresh rate exceeds that supported
   by the VideoStar card, screen corruption may occur in Windows.

For more information, contact Diamond technical support.
