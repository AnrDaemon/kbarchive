TITLE   :FIX: Error C2579 When Using Function Templates
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::2.0,2.1,4.0,4.1,4.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbCompiler kbCPPonly kbVC kbVC500fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 2.0, 2.1, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When compiling function templates that contain a literal character, the compiler
may complain about 'ambiguous' parameter lists. Visual C++ version 4.0 may
generate the following error:

   error C2579: 'identifier1' : parameter list not
   sufficiently different from 'identifier2'

Visual C++ version 2.x may generate the following errors:

   error C2579: 'identifier1' : parameter list not
   sufficiently different from 'identifier2'

   fatal error C1903: unable to recover from previous
   error(s); stopping compilation

RESOLUTION
==========

Explicitly type cast the literal character with "(char)" to eliminate this
error. For example, in the sample code provided below, cast the literal
character 'c' to (char)'c' to work around the problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the following sample code to demonstrate the problem. Both functions
(func(c) and func('c')) are necessary to reproduce the problem.

Sample Code to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------------

      /* Compile options needed: none
      */ 

      template <class T>
      int func(T)
      {
         static int x = 0;
         return x;
      }

      main()
      {
         char c;

         func(c);
         func('c');
         return 0;
      }
