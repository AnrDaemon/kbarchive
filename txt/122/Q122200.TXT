SYMPTOMS

When you attempt to start the Windows NT Server version 3.5 Remoteboot service
from the Services portion of Control Panel, the following error message may
appear:

   The Remoteboot Service service returned service specific error 2612

When you attempt to start the Remoteboot service from a command line with the NET
START REMOTEBOOT command, the following error message appears:

   A service specific error occurred: 2612

In addition, the following event messages appear in Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 5766, Source: RemoteBoot, Type: Error Description: Service failed
   to initialize from its database. The database may be missing or corrupted.
   Service will attempt restoring the database from the backup.

   Event ID: 5767, Source: RemoteBoot, Type: Error Description: Service failed to
   restore its database from the backup. Service will not start.

   Event ID: 7024, Source: Service Control Manager, Type: Error Description: The
   Remoteboot Service service terminated with service-specific error 2612.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the MDB extension files in the server's
%SystemRoot%\RPL directory and in the %SystemRoot%\RPL\Backup directory are
corrupt, read-only, or non-existent.

RESOLUTION
==========

To enable the Remoteboot service, use the following procedure:

1. Make sure that the MDB extension files are not marked read-only.

2. Assuming that SYSTEM.MDB and RPLSVC.MDB are located in the %SystemRoot%\RPL
   and %SystemRoot%\RPL\Backup directories and are not marked read-only, the
   files are probably corrupt. If so, either delete or rename the *.MDB files.

3. Copy the MDB extension files from the CLIENTS\RPL directory on the Windows NT
   Server version 3.5 Installation CD-ROM. Make sure to remove the read-only
   attributes after copying the files.

4. Restart the Remoteboot service.

5. Backup the Remoteboot database by choosing BackupDatabase from the Configure
   menu of Remoteboot Manager.
