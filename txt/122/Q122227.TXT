TITLE   :FIX: Incremental Link Fails to Change the Subsystem Version
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVC400fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Linker (LINK.EXE), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you perform a link using the Microsoft Linker, the subsystem version does
not change.

The subsystem version info is used by the operating system when running the
application. Applications with incorrect subsystem versions may not run
correctly.


CAUSE
=====

The linker fails to change the subsystem version when performing an incremental
link.

RESOLUTION
==========

Force the linker to perform a full link to force it to change the subsystem
version number. To force a full link, link with the /incremental:no linker
option, or delete the executable.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is a problem only if you want to change the subsystem version without
changing the subsystem type. If you change the subsystem type, the linker
automatically performs a full link.

You can view the subsystem version number by using DUMPBIN with the /HEADERS
option. The subsystem version number specifies the minimum required version of
the subsystem.

Additional query words: subsystem 2.50 link
