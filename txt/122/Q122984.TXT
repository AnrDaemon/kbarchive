SUMMARY
=======

If you install one of the championship golf courses (that is, Banff Springs,
Mauna Kea, or Pinehurst), without having installed the actual Microsoft Golf
game, you will receive the following error message:

   Setup could not find Microsoft Golf in the specified destination path. If you
   wish to select another destination path, choose Retry or choose Cancel Setup
   to exit.

The setup routine allows you to change to directories other than the default, but
Microsoft Golf must be installed onto your computer prior to installing one of
the courses.

Once the game Microsoft Golf has been installed, the championship courses should
install with no further problem.
