The DEC Pathworks for Windows NT network does not function properly under
Windows NT or Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1 or Windows NT 3.5 with
a 3COM Etherlink III network adapter. You might have problems installing
the software, or there may be messages logged in the Event Viewer.

DEC Pathworks for Windows NT needs to be able to perform a "Set Station
Address" to the 3COM Etherlink III card. This ability is required, because
DECnet expects that card to change it's address to AA-00-00-xx-xx-xx,
(where the xx-xx-xx is the actual DECNET node ID) and not the physical
hardware address of the card. With the current 3COM drivers that Microsoft
ships, this function is not possible. (Note: This problem may also occur
with other network adapters whose drivers do not enable this
functionality). There is currently no workaround.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1 and Windows NT 3.5. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
