-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to install a printer driver for a platform other than the one you are
running on, the following error message appears:

   Could not find setup file F:\<platform>\PRINTER.INF.

For example, if you have a Windows NT 3.5 print server running on an x86- based
computer and try to install a driver to support one of the other Alpha or MIPS
platforms, this error message would be displayed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem happens because the PRINTER.INF files on the Windows NT version 3.5
CD are compressed.

WORKAROUND
==========

Copy the directory for platform you want to install a printer for from the CD to
a hard disk drive and expand the PRINTER.INF file. Then install the driver from
the hard disk drive.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
