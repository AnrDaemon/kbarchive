TITLE   :PC WSPlus: Dynamic Connections Not Released
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When dynamic connections are used in version 1.0 of Schedule+ for Windows to
open appointment books on other servers, the connection to the other server is
not released until you Exit and Sign Out of Schedule+. This is true for
Microsoft LAN Manager, Windows NT, and Windows for Workgroups networks.

This problem can also cause the following error to appear in Schedule+ when you
try to open an Appointment Book:

   The Schedule file could not be opened. You may not have the necessary access
   privileges or the file may be unavailable.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, increase the value of the SESSION entry in the
PROTOCOL.INI file. This does not correct the problem, but it allows the
workstation to connect to additional servers.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 1.0 of Schedule+ for
Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: schedule plus 1.00 dynamic
