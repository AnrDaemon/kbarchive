TITLE   :Bus-Mastering SCSI Controller Problem with Etherlink 16/16TP
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a 3Com EtherLink 16 (3C507) or EtherLink l6 TP (3C507TP)
network adapter, one or more of the following problems may occur:

 - Windows for Workgroups stops responding (hangs) when you try to quit Windows.

 - Your machine displays time-out errors or hangs during the LOGON process.

 - Large file transfers to and from the servers result in data corruption.

CAUSE
=====

The 3Com EtherLink 16 (3C507) and EtherLink l6 TP (3C507TP) adapters are
incompatible with bus-mastering SCSI hard disk controllers in Intel EISA- based
personal computers.

RESOLUTION
==========

3Com has created a hardware upgrade to correct this problem. The upgrade
requires replacing the programmable array logic (PAL) chip on the 3C507 adapter.
This upgrade lengthens the amount of time the network adapter waits for a signal
from the bus. Contact 3Com for information about obtaining this upgrade.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a bus-mastering device takes over the PC bus, it may hold the bus for an
indefinite period of time, causing the 3C507 to experience a time-out.

The 3C507 adapter relies heavily on the PC bus for timing information.

The 3C507 network interface card is manufactured by 3Com, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
