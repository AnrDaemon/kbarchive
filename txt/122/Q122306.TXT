TITLE   :PRB: Error C4226 and Defining WIN32
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler

KEYWORDS:kbprb

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Compiling a source file that includes WINDOWS.H generates many C4226 errors,
such as:

   C:\MSVC20\INCLUDE\olebase.h (8954) : error C4226: nonstandard extension used
   : '__export' is an obsolete keyword

   ...

   C:\MSVC20\INCLUDE\oleauto.h(293) : error C4226: nonstandard extension used :
   '__huge' is an obsolete keyword

   ...

   C:\MSVC20\INCLUDE\ole2.h(4818) : error C4226: nonstandard extension used :
   '__export' is an obsolete keyword

Including these header files individually causes the same problem.

CAUSE
=====

A number of the OLE header files that are included in the WINDOWS.H file require
WIN32 to be defined. While _WIN32 is defined for you, WIN32 is not. Because
WIN32 is not defined, the header file logic assumes that the definitions are for
16-bit Windows-based applications and uses the __export and __huge keywords.

RESOLUTION
==========

Here are three possible way to define WIN32:

 - Define WIN32 before the WINDOWS.H file is included.

      #define WIN32
      #include <windows.h>

 - Define WIN32 in a compiler switch. From the command line, use /DWIN32. In the
   development environment, follow these following steps:

   1. Choose Settings from the Projects menu, and click the C/C++ tab.

   2. Select the Preprocessor category.

   3. Add WIN32 to the Preprocessor Definitions field of the dialog box.

 - Add the following lines to the beginning of the WINDOWS.H file:

      #if( defined (_WIN32) && !defined (WIN32) )
      #define WIN32
      #endif

   NOTE: This will not take care of the case where individual OLE header files
   are included in an application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem will most likely occur when building console applications.

NOTE: Although this was by design, this behavior was changed in Microsoft Visual
C++, 32-bit Edition, version 4.0.
