The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.0 with a non-English
version of Windows NT, one or both of the following problems may occur:

 - Site Configuration Manager cannot set any directory permissions.

 - Despooler fails on any package because the directory permissions cannot be
   set.

RESOLUTION
==========

To allow SMS to work with non-English versions of Windows NT Server, the
following procedure is recommended in User Manager:

1. Duplicate the non-English local Administrators group to "Administrators" in
   English.

2. Duplicate the non-English local Guests group as the "Guests" group in
   English.

3. Duplicate the non-English local Users group as the "Users" group in English.

4. Duplicate the non-English local Users group as the "Everyone" group in
   English and add the global Domain Guests group to it.

5. Restart Windows NT.
