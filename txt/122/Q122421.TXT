The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following problems occur on computers running Windows NT Advanced Server
version 3.1 or Windows NT Server version 3.5 with any token ring card that
allows setting the Transmit/Receive Buffer size:

 - On a Windows NT Advanced Server computer, the server service randomly stops
   allowing new connections and appears to stop responding (hang). Any clients
   that are already connected hang if you try to do anything over their
   connections. At this point, you cannot pause or stop the server service (an
   hourglass appears). There are no errors in the event log, and the workstation
   service is still running.

 - On Windows NT Server installations, Event 2000 errors occur. When the
   workstation makes a request to establish a session, it receives a failure
   message from the server, stating that there is a lack of resources available.

CAUSE
=====

By default, the Madge card is optimized for workstations (8 Receive and 4
Transmit), not for servers.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Madge card has settings that are configurable for the Transmit and Receive
buffers. Increase the settings on the server to 12 Receive and 8 Transmit
buffers as follows:

1. Start the Network component of Control Panel

2. Select your Madge adapter in the Installed Adapter Cards box

3. Choose the Configure button

4. In the Rx/Tx Buffers box, select Rx=12 and Tx=6.

The Madge product included here is manufactured by Madge Networks, Inc., a vendor
