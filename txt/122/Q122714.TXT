TITLE   :ADT: Data Outline Control Events Not Triggered
PRODUCT :Microsoft Access Distribution Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, versions 2.0, 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.

Code assigned to a Data Outline control's event (such as the DoRowClick,
DoRowDblClick, or DoKeyPress event) does not run when the event occurs.

CAUSE
=====

The Data Outline control's SendMouseEvents and SendKeyboardEvents properties are
not set to True. The default for both properties is False.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set the Data Outline control's SendMouseEvents and SendKeyboardEvents properties
to True to enable the triggering of mouse and keyboard events by the Data
Outline control. To set the SendMouseEvents and SendKeyboardEvents properties to
True, follow these steps:

1. Open the form containing the Data Outline control in Design view.

2. Using the right mouse button, click the Data Outline control.

3. On the shortcut menu, point to Data Outline Control Object, and then click
   Properties.

4. Click to select the SendMouseEvents and SendKeyboardEvents check boxes, and
   then click OK.

Note that you need only select the appropriate property for the type of events
you want the Data Outline control to process. For example, if you want the Data
Outline control to process only mouse events, click to select only the
SendMouseEvents check box.

released an Office 97-compatible version of the Data Outline control on the
World Wide Web. This updated version has no documentation. To obtain a copy of
