The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1

The Lexmark 4033 printer family with network adapters support single and
multiple network protocols under Windows NT versions 3.1 and 3.5.

Lexmark printer models 4033-01, 02, and 03 use Internal Network Adapters
(INAs) that support a single proprietary protocol called Lexlink (follows
IEEE 802.2 standards). In order for these network printers to be detected
by Windows NT using DLC, network printer software with part number 1329980
is required.

Lexmark printer models 4033-201 and 202 (also called Lexmark Market XLE
printers) support multiple protocols, such as TCP/IP, NWLink and Lexlink,
if you use the network software shipped with the printer. These models do
not require the network printer software (part number 1329980) to use the
Lexlink protocol.

To order any of the network printer software discussed above or for
additional information about the Lexmark 4033 network printer family,
contact Lexmark Technical Support at (606) 232-3000.

The products included here are manufactured by Lexmark, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
