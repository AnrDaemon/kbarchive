SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail for Windows Address Book can contain the global address list,
Personal Address Book, postoffice list, other postoffices, and gateway address
list. This article provides the structure of a open directory that contains
these address lists and their order.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When choosing the Address Book from the Mail menu or selecting the Address
button from the compose window, you are presented with a list displaying the
default directory view. If you select the Open Directory button, a listing of
other addresses becomes available. This list might contain two or more of the
following entries:

   Personal Address Book <- Personal Address Book (PAB)
   Global address list   <- Global address list (GAL), if participating in
                            directory synchronization (Dir-Sync)
   Postoffice list       <- Postoffice Address List (POL)
   Other Postoffices
     NETWORKEXT          <- Externally defined network name(s)
       POSTOFFICE        <- Externally defined postoffice address list(s)
     NETWORKLOC          <- Your postoffice's local network name
       POSTOFFICE        <- Other postoffice address list(s) defined with
                            the same network name as your local postoffice.
   Gateway
     X.400               <- gateway address list(s)

This list may vary depending on the address lists enabled or disabled by the Mail
administrator. For example, using the Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE),
the administrator can disable or enable the GAL.
