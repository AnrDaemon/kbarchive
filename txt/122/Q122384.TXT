The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You create and share a printer in Print Manager on a computer running Windows NT
version 3.1. You connect to the printer in Print Manager on a computer running
Windows NT version 3.5. Then, if you try to pause the printer the following
error message appears:

   Could not pause printer. The printer command is invalid.

This problem also occurs when you connect from a computer running Windows NT 3.1
to a printer on a computer running Windows NT 3.5. It does not occur if both
computers are running the same version of Windows NT. Setting the shared
printer's permissions for Everyone to have full control does not correct the
problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1 and Windows NT version 3.5. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
