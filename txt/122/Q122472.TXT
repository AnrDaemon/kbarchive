SUMMARY
=======

The Encarta programs listed at the top of this article are subject to the
following video limitations. This article includes problems and solutions, plus
additional references when available.

Many of these problems can be solved by obtaining updated video drivers from your
hardware vendor.

This article refers to Windows 3.1x video drivers. If you are using Windows 95,
we recommend using the new Windows 95 video drivers. These problems generally do
not occur with updated drivers.
