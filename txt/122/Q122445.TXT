The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

In a Windows NT domain, if you attempt to change the password of your Windows
for Workgroups version 3.11 client workstation, and if the minimum password age
has not expired, the following error message appears:

   Error 59: An unexpected network error has occurred.


CAUSE
=====

Windows NT uses a Transact server to respond to downlevel client Transact API.
To change the password, the downlevel client uses the NetUserPasswordSet API.
This problem occurs due to the transact server not sending the correct return
code for this API. As a result, the client workstation shows a generic error
message of Error 59.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1 and Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server
version 3.5. This problem was corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Windows NT version 3.5. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on
