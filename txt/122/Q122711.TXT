SUMMARY
=======

Get your own personal copy of the "Microsoft Foundation Classes 3.1 White
Paper." This document gives a technical discussion of the major features of MFC
version 3.1 and gives developers a set of reusable, prebuilt C++ components that
provide a completely portable interface for applications for the Microsoft
Windows and Windows NT operating systems as well as the Macintosh platform. It
also includes information about previous versions of MFC.

These MFC prebuilt C++ components encapsulate the common Windows-based functions
that people have come to expect in any Windows-based application, such as:

 - Toolbars and status bars

 - Form and edit views

 - Print and print preview

 - OLE Visual Editing and OLE Automation

 - Multiple-document interface (MDI)

 - Splitter and scroller windows

 - Dialog data exchange and validation

 - Dialog boxes

 - Database access

 - Context-sensitive help

By using MFC's pre-built components, programmers can quickly create professional
applications for Windows that contain pre-constructed application behavior. By
using the MFC library, programmers save a considerable amount of development
time.
