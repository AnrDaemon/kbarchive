TITLE   :ADT2: WRKGADM.EXE File Installed Without Being Specified
PRODUCT :Microsoft Access Distribution Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install a custom application that you created with the Microsoft Access
Developer's Toolkit (ADT) version 2.0, a file named WRKGADM.EXE is installed in
the application directory even though you did not specify this file for
installation when you created the application's custom Setup.

CAUSE
=====

The WRKGADM.EXE file is the Workgroup Administrator utility and is required to
create a system database if you do not include one with your run-time
application. Setup copies the WRKGADM.EXE file to the application directory and
then runs it to create the system database. After running the file, Setup is
unable to delete it.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you include a system database file called SYSTEM.MDA with your custom
application, Setup will not copy the WRKGADM.EXE file to the application
directory. If you want to include a system database with a name other than
SYSTEM.MDA, include the custom system database and any file called SYSTEM.MDA
(for instance, a text file) with your application.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Access Developer's
Toolkit version 2.0. This problem no longer occurs in the Microsoft Access
Developer's Toolkit version 7.0.
