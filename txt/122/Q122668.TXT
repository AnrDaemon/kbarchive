TITLE   :Writer/Artist: Patterned Objects Appear Blurry on Printouts
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Kids Products

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
 - Microsoft Fine Artist for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print patterned objects from Creative Writer to a printer with a
resolution greater than 75 dots per inch (dpi), the printed object may appear
blurry.

NOTE: When you print an identical object from Fine Artist, it prints more
clearly.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Creative Writer attempts to print at the resolution
(dpi) of the printer. (Fine Artist always prints at 75 dpi regardless of the dpi
of the printer. Also, Fine Artist creates a bitmap of the page and Creative
Writer does not.) As a result, there is a degradation of patterns on very high
resolution printers when you print from Creative Writer.

WORKAROUND
==========

 - Copy and paste the object into Fine Artist and print it.

   -or-

 - Copy and paste the object into Microsoft Windows Paintbrush and print it.
