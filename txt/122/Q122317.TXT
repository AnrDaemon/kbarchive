TITLE   :TCP/IP-32 May Fail on Token Ring Network with Source Routing
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER::3.11; WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If Microsoft TCP/IP-32 and IPXODI are loaded on a token ring network with source
routing enabled, the TCP/IP-32 utilities, such as PING, may fail to locate hosts
on the network.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs due to incorrect configuration of ROUTE.COM (Novell's
IBM-Token-Ring Source Routing Driver with DOS ODI) and incorrectly configured
NET.CFG file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

1. Copy the ROUTE.COM file to a boot disk from the Novell DOS ODI Workstation
   Services disk.

2. Add the following two lines in the AUTOEXEC.BAT after LANSUP.COM or TOKEN.COM
   and before the protocol stack:

   " ROUTE BOARD = 01
   ROUTE BOARD = 02
   " (without the quotation marks)

   NOTE: The BOARD parameter does not refer to the physical NIC. Instead, it
   refers to the Frame specified in the NET.CFG file.

3. Add the following two lines in the NET.CFG file (if it is not already
   present):

   " Frame Token-Ring
   Frame Token-Ring_SNAP
   " (without the quotation marks)
