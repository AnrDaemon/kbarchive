The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a Pioneer DRM-600 Multi-CD player that holds 6 compact discs (CDs)
in Windows NT, 8 CD-ROM drives appear in File Manager.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs due to older firmware versions of the Pioneer DRM-600
Multi-CD player not returning a status byte of 7Fh for device 6 and 7h. When
Windows NT queries the SCSI chain looking for valid devices, it examines the
status byte returned from each SCSI device it addresses. If the device returns a
status byte of 7Fh, Windows NT considers it as an invalid device and does not
create a Registry entry for it.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, call Pioneer Technical Support at (800) 872-4159 to
obtain the latest firmware revision for the Pioneer DRM-600 Multi-CD player.
Pioneer Technical Support recommends that you upgrade the firmware to at least
Revision 804. Revision 806 is the latest firmware revision and order number is
Pioneer P/N DRM-600UPG.

The Pioneer product discussed here is manufactured by Pioneer Electronics Inc., a
vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding the product's performance or reliability.
