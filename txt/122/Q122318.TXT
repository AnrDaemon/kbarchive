TITLE   :Using Null Modem for RAS with Third-Party PPP Clients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attach a third-party Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) client to a Remote
Access Service (RAS) server via a null modem cable, the RAS server port status
reports a hardware failure and no connection is made.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs due to the null modem scripts in the MODEM.INF file being
specifically written for Windows NT computers only.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, you can modify the Null Modem entry in the MODEM.INF
file for the Windows NT RAS server and the INI extension file for the
third-party PPP client.

NOTE: If you are using Modem.inf with Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0, see the
following article in the Microsoft knowledge base:

   ARTICLE-ID: Q150808
   TITLE : Disabling Support for Unimodem Modems in Remote Access

Server Side
-----------

Change the Null Modem entry in the MODEM.INF file to the following:

   CALLBACK_TIME=10
   DEFAULTOFF=compression
   MAXCARRIERBPS=19200
   MAXCONNECTBPS=19200

   COMMAND_INIT=
   NoResponse

   COMMAND_LISTEN=
   CONNECT=$
   CONNECT=<h00>CLIENT
   COMMAND_LISTEN=
   NoResponse

   COMMAND_DIAL=CLIENT
   CONNECT=SERVER

Client Side
-----------

For the client side, you want to send a "$" (without quotation marks) to signify
a CONNECT. For example, the Chameleon product from NetManage, Inc., uses a
SLIP.INI file to send scripts. In the section for Windows NT, change the
following lines:

   "script=-n" to "script=-n $$ -n" (without quotes)

The Chameleon product discussed here is manufactured by NetManage, Inc., a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this product's performance or reliability.
