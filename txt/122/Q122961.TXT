TITLE   :Print Job Stalls Printing to NEC NPDL2
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect a MIPS computer running Windows NT to a NEC PC-PR2000/4 or NEC
PC-PR4000E/4, install the appropriate printer driver, and attempt to print
TESTJ.TXT (from the floppy disk provided with the printer), the print job
stalls.

CAUSE
=====

When a memory allocation request is issued (especially with CacheAligned option)
at a particular range of memory block size for non-paged pool, overflow of an
internal array occurs. As a result, a spin-lock of non- paged pool is not
unlocked, and IRQL is left as 2 (unchanged).

This error occurs within ExAllocatePoolWithQuota which is called out from
NtWriteFile, when a pool block for data copy is allocated.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Windows NT Server version 3.5. This problem was corrected in the latest U.S.
Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.5. For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
