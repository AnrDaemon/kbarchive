The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0

SYMPTOMS
========

You are running more than one software metering server and licenses are not
being balanced correctly. This article describes how you can identify the
problem area.

Items to Check If Licenses Are Not Being Correctly Balanced
-----------------------------------------------------------

 - Is the schedule configured appropriately?

   If the scheduled balancing is set too far apart, there may be servers with too
   many available licenses and other servers without any available licenses. You
   can check to see what the trend is in the log of historical activities, and
   then set the schedule accordingly.

 - Does the License Metering component have access to all software metering
   servers?

   License Metering connects to each server through Open Database Connectivity
   (ODBC) and queries each server for its minimum license number and buffer from
   the reserve pool. License balancing then occurs between servers based on the
   procured information (LICSRVC.log).

 - Does License Metering have to do license balancing too often, which indicates
   that there are too many clients that need an application license for too many
   applications at once?

   If License Metering is constantly dealing with instant license balancing,
   scheduled license balancing and general response speed will suffer. A study
   of the historical trend in license balancing and user callbacks will help you
   in designing the system to ensure that License Metering is not constantly
   distributing licenses on demand from low-activity to high-activity servers.
