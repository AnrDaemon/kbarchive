KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbPackage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Systems Management Server 2.0 gives you the ability to set access priveledges on
Package access points. If you change the Access Account properties, the package
must be updated on all distribution servers where this package resides in order
for these changes to take affect. To update your distribution points after
making this type of change, right-click the Distribution Points node and select
Update Distribution Points on the All Tasks menu.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Updating the distribution servers does not merely update the Access Account
properties, it refreshes the entire package, including all source files (if the
package contains any).
