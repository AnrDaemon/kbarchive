SUMMARY
=======

The Trigger Manager thread of the Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) SQL
Monitor service is responsible for notifying other SMS components of database
changes. This service allows an almost instantaneous response to the creation,
update, or deletion of, or the request for, numerous SMS processes such as
collection updates.

To inform the Trigger Manager of specific database events, SMS Executive thread
components add keys to a specific location in the site server?s registry. Each
trigger responds to an insert, update, or deletion on a specific database table
and writes to the inbox of the component specified in the registry. The absence
of these triggers can prevent SMS thread components from acting on proposed
changes.

If triggers are not generated in the expected inboxes, check the following to
identify the problem area:

 - If the site server computer and SQL Server computer are different computers,
   verify network connectivity between the two. Also, examine the SMS SQL
   Monitor status messages or the SMSdbmon.log file to verify that SMS SQL
   Monitor has read the triggers from the registry and installed them to the
   appropriate tables in the SMS site database.

 - Examine the SMSdbmon.log file to verify that the following conditions are
   true:

    - SMS SQL Monitor has access to the specified inboxes at the site server
      where it must write the key file for the trigger.

    - The key file (for example, *.adc or *.udc) was written to
      SMS\Inboxes\<component>.box (for example, SMS\Inboxes\Colleval.box).

 - If the trigger file was written, verify from the appropriate component log
   file that the component has read the key file and taken the required action.
