TITLE   :SMS: Only a Single Site Code Is Displayed Under Collections
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) network discovery process, the
subnet search results in only a single site code being displayed under
Collections on the server where network discovery was initiated.

CAUSE
=====

Discovery Data Manager assigns site codes by site boundary. If a resource is
assigned to more than one site code, the Collection Evaluator uses the first
(lowest) site code for the Site Code column. There is no way for the Collection
Evaluator to determine which of the site codes to display, if any.
