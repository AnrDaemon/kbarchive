TITLE   :Golf 99 Err Msg: ...Exception 10h in Module Msvbvm50.dll
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg w_golf kbimu msgame

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Golf 1999 Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you minimize the Golf 99 startup screen or press ALT+TAB to switch to a
different program, if you quit that program and then press ENTER to restore Golf
99, the program behaves as if you clicked the last button you selected on the
Golf 99 startup screen.

If this button was Quick Start, you also receive the following error message:

   Msgolf99 caused an exception 10h in module Msvbvm50.dll.

When you click Close, and then click Microsoft Golf 99 on the taskbar, you
restore Golf 99, but the screen graphics are distorted.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if both of the following conditions are true:

 - Golf 99 is minimized.

 - The Microsoft Golf 99 button on the task bar is selected (depressed) when you
   press ENTER.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this problem from occurring, press ALT+TAB or click Microsoft Golf 99
on the taskbar to restore Golf 99. Do not press ENTER to restore Golf 99.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Golf 1999 Edition,
version 1.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you minimize Golf 99, the ENTER key remains mapped to the last button you
selected in the Golf 99 startup screen. If another program is running when you
press ALT+TAB, the problem does not occur because the Microsoft Golf 99 button
on the taskbar is not selected.
