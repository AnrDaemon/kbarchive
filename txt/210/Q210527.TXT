PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbsetup kbimu msgame

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Golf 1999 Edition, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add one or more golf courses to your installation of Microsoft Golf
1999 Edition, the following message may briefly appear on the screen:

   Removing Game Files

NOTE: No game files are actually removed from your installation of Golf 99
despite the appearance of this message.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if both of the following conditions are true:

 - You selected the Minimum installation option when you installed Golf 99.

 - You add the course using the Add/Remove Setup option from the Add/Remove
   Programs tool in Control Panel.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Golf 1999 Edition,
version 1.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This message is displayed because the Golf 99 Setup program compares your
current installation of Golf with the modifications to be made by Golf Setup in
Maintenance mode. This message is displayed when this comparison is being made.
If you remove courses or any other game files, the files are removed at this
time.

However, if you add courses or any other game files, this message is still
displayed even though no game files are removed.
