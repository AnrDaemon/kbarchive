TITLE   :Changing Video Drivers in 3.11--Repeated Prompts for Disk 1
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to change the video driver in Windows 3.11 to a driver that has not
been previously installed (or when you select "New" for a previously installed
driver), Setup prompts you to insert Disk 1. After you choose OK, it continues
to prompt you to insert Disk 1 without completing the video driver change.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Windows portion of SETUP.EXE is coded to find
the file WIN.CNF on Disk 1. With Windows 3.11, this file is on Disk 2 of the
3.5-inch 1.44-megabyte (MB) disk set and Disk 3 of the 5.25-inch 1.2- MB disk
set.

RESOLUTION
==========

To finish Setup, insert Disk 2 of the 3.5-inch 1.44-MB disk set or Disk 3 of the
5.25-inch 1.2-MB disk set instead of Disk 1, or run SETUP.EXE from the Windows
directory at an MS-DOS command prompt.
