PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Cinemania for Macintosh, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 editions 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may find that you cannot hear sound in Cinemania even though sound plays
correctly in other applications. Or, you may find that sound plays only in
Cinemania, and not in any other application.

This problem can occur if the Sound control panel is corrupt.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, use Finder to copy the Sound control panel from the
Installer Files: System Files folder on the Cinemania CD to the system folder on
the hard drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the Sound control panel already installed in the system folder is corrupt, it
may return an incorrect version number to the Cinemania installer when you are
installing Cinemania. This can cause the installer not to install the latest
version.

For this reason, it is important that you use Finder to copy the file instead of
using the installer to reinstall the Sound control panel if you are having
trouble with sounds not playing.
