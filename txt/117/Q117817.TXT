PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER::1994 edition
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Cinemania for the Macintosh 1994 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your Macintosh has a small monitor (13 inches, for example), the cast lists
in Cinemania may wrap and align incorrectly. To display the text fully on a
small monitor, Cinemania may need to wrap cast lists that include long names.
Wrapped text does not align correctly.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Cinemania 1994 for the
Macintosh. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
