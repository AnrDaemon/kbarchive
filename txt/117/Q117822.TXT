PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Cinemania for the Macintosh 1994 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you copy text that includes special or international characters from
Cinemania into another application, the special characters may no longer display
correctly. This occurs because the text is no longer formatted for Lucida.

RESOLUTION
==========

To restore the special or foreign characters, format your text as Lucida. The
characters should now display and print correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The V-series Lucida Sans fonts is a custom bitmap font installed with Cinemania.
This font does not map special or international characters correctly to the
Macintosh character set. Because of this, special characters may appear as boxes
or other inappropriate or nonprinting characters when you copy them to an
application such as TeachText.
