KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Cinemania for the Macintosh 1994 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have 50 kilobytes or less of system memory available, audio playback may
fail in Cinemania.

This problem occurs because the WAVE library cannot allocate a sound channel if
there is not sufficient memory available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, do the following:

1. Exit from Cinemania.

2. From the Apple menu at the left end of the menu bar, choose About This
   Macintosh.

3. Check to see how much memory is available to the system. The "Largest Unused
   Block" needs to be greater than 2500k to successfully run Cinemania 1994.

If you can make enough memory available to your system and to Cinemania, your
sounds should play correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Cinemania 1994 needs a relatively large amount of your computer's system memory
(RAM) to display pictures and play sounds. Cinemania should be able to run on
systems with 4 MB or more of memory. If you have only 4 MB of memory, and your
system software uses a large portion of your RAM, you may need to adjust memory
usage to allow Cinemania 1994 to run properly.

For more information about adjusting your Macintosh's memory usage, refer to item
#2, "Memory Use", in the Microsoft Cinemania 1994 readme file.
