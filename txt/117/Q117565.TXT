SUMMARY
=======

MFC provides a great deal of information on the current printer in the framework
printing functions. However, information on the current printer is limited
outside of these functions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The only way to gain access to the current printers settings is through the
m_hDevMode and m_hDevNames structures stored in CWinApp. These members are
accessed through a PRINTDLG structure whose pointer is passed to the
GetPrinterDeviceDefaults() member function of a class derived from CWinApp
class. Because the return values, hDevMode and hDevNames, are HGLOBAL variables,
::GlobalLock() must be called to return a pointer to the structures. Using this
pointer, you can extract information from the structure to determine the current
state of the printer. Please see DEVMODE and DEVNAMES in the SDK online Help for
more information on the contents of these structures.

The sample code below is a member function of a CView-derived class that returns
the current page size of the printer by using GetDeviceCaps() on a CDC object
created with the printer settings:

Sample Code
-----------

      /* Compile options needed: none
      */ 

         BOOL CMyView::GetPageSize(CSize &nRetVal)
         {
            PRINTDLG FAR * pPrintDlg = new PRINTDLG;
            BOOL bRet = FALSE;

         // Get the current printer's settings.

            if(AfxGetApp()->GetPrinterDeviceDefaults(pPrintDlg))
            {

         // Get pointers to the two setting structures.

               DEVNAMES FAR *lpDevNames =
               (DEVNAMES FAR *)::GlobalLock(pPrintDlg->hDevNames);

               DEVMODE FAR *lpDevMode =
               (DEVMODE FAR *)::GlobalLock(pPrintDlg->hDevMode);

         // Get the specific driver information.

               CString szDriver((LPTSTR)lpDevNames +
                                    lpDevNames->wDriverOffset);
               CString szDevice((LPTSTR)lpDevNames +
                                    lpDevNames->wDeviceOffset);
               CString szOutput((LPTSTR)lpDevNames +
                                    lpDevNames->wOutputOffset);

         // Create a CDC object according to the current settings.

               CDC pDC;
               pDC.CreateDC(szDriver, szDevice, szOutput, lpDevMode);

         // Query this CDC object for the width and height of the current
         // page.

               nRetVal.cx = pDC.GetDeviceCaps(HORZSIZE);
               nRetVal.cy = pDC.GetDeviceCaps(VERTSIZE);

         // Get rid of the CDC object.

               pDC.DeleteDC();

         // Unlock the pointers to the setting structures.

               ::GlobalUnlock(pPrintDlg->hDevNames);
               ::GlobalUnlock(pPrintDlg->hDevMode);

             bRet = TRUE;
            }
          delete pPrintDlg;
          return bRet;
      }
