SUMMARY

When you are having printing problems, you should try to print from the
operating system, where applicable, as well as from other applications in order
to determine where the problem lies. To determine whether printing from the
operating system works, you can use a simple test such as the following, which
shows how to print to a file from FoxPro. To run this test, issue the following
commands in the Command window:
