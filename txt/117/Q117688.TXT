======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows or Windows for Workgroups fails to install a new printer driver from the
printer driver disk you received from Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS).
When you try to install the printer driver using the Unlisted or Updated Printer
option in Control Panel, the Install Driver dialog box does not find any drivers
on the floppy disk.


CAUSE
=====

Some of the printer driver disks now being shipped have the printer drivers in a
subdirectory instead of the root directory. Windows and Windows for Workgroups
do not find the drivers by default because the drivers are located in a
subdirectory.

RESOLUTION
==========

At the command line in the Install Driver dialog box, type the path to the
appropriate directory in which the driver is located.
