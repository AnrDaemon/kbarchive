SYMPTOMS
========

occur. This problem occurs with the Diamond Stealth VRAM version 2.0 video
driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, contact the manufacturer of your display adapter to
inquire about obtaining the latest version of the video drivers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This card will not run with the standard SVGA video driver or with the S3

then try to exit and restart to make your changes take effect, Windows will not
be able to load.
