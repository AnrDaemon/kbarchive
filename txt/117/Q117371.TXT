TITLE   :Setting Performance Monitor Alert to Run Program May Not Work
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you set the Admin Performance Monitor (Perfmon) Alert to run a program on
alert, it may not work properly or error messages may appear.

CAUSE
=====

The execute command from Perfmon is also passing the Alert condition to the
program. This allows users to log the alert information. However, this also
causes a problem because most applications, such as Notepad, MPlay32, and even
Perfmon, are not ready for the extra arguments at the end of the command line.

WORKAROUND
==========

To set up a program to run on alert, put the line in a batch file and insert the
batch file name in the Run Program On Alert box.
