SUMMARY
=======

With Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, you can automatically reboot the MS-DOS
External Mail program when critical errors occur. To specify automatic rebooting
when critical errors occur, specify RebootOnCE in the EXTERNAL.INI file. For
example:

   [External]
   RebootOnCE

MORE INFORMATION
================

A critical error is generated by MS-DOS when an unrecoverable situation occurs
in an application. When this happens, the message "Abort, Retry, Fail?" is
displayed. To continue using the application, you must respond.

For example, this type of critical error occurs if, when the External Mail
program is running, a network connection fails because of a problem on the file
server. The External Mail program traps the error and stops moving mail on the
failed connection; however, it continues to move mail on other connections. The
External Mail program tries to re-establish the failed connection and MS-DOS
successfully reconnects if the condition that caused the critical error has been
corrected.

In some environments, network redirectors become unstable after a critical error
occurs. It is possible that the External Mail program will not be able to
re-establish the postoffice connection and will hang. If this occurs, the
computer on which the External Mail program is running must be rebooted. Instead
of manually rebooting the computer, you can specify an External Mail program
option to reboot automatically.

This information is available in the README.TXT file on Mail for PC Networks Disk
1 for version 3.2.
