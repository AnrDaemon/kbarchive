======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you drag a Microsoft Word 6.0 for Windows document icon to a Microsoft Word
6.0 application shortcut on the desktop, you receive an error indicating that
Word cannot open the document two separate times. Word seems to be trying to
open two separate documents.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Word 6.0 for Windows recognizes only those files
that conform to the 8.3 file specification. If the filename for the document
contains a space, Word does not recognize it as a valid filename. Instead, Word
interprets the filename as two different files: the first file using the letters
before the space, and the second file using the letters after the space. For
example, the filename "TEST FILE.DOC" is recognized as the files TEST.DOC and
FILE.DOC.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, rename the file to a name that contains no spaces and
conforms to the 8.3 file specification.
