TITLE   :Full Network Printer Path Not Shown in Microsoft Excel 5.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click Print on the File menu in Microsoft Excel 5.0, the full path to
the network printer is not displayed.


NOTE: Microsoft Excel 4.0 for Windows, Microsoft Word 6.0 for Windows, and other
programs correctly display the full network printer path in the Print dialog
box.

WORKAROUND
==========

To view the entire path for the network printer, click the Printer Setup button
in the Print dialog box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you print to a network printer using Microsoft Excel 5.0 in Windows 95, the
Print dialog box displays the share name for the network printer. It does not
display the computer name. For example, if the printer is shared on a computer
with the name PRINTSERV and the share name is PRINTER1, the Print dialog box
displays the following information:

   Printer: <type of printer> on PRINTER1

The expected display should read:

   Printer: <type of printer> on \\PRINTSERV\PRINTER1

This does not affect the ability of Microsoft Excel 5.0 to use to network
printers.

Additional query words: xl print net
