======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

At the point when the External program, Mail Transfer Agent (MTA), included with
versions 2.1, 3.0, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, has to generate
undeliverables if the original message body contains any highlighted color
attributes in the text. They will not be retained when the original sender
receives the returned mail along with the system message indicating
undeliverable status.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce
------------------

1. In the MS-DOS client or Monitor utility, included with Mail for PC Networks,
   send mail including highlighted text to a remote user or invalid external
   postoffice alias ensuring that you have set pre-established variables to
   cause the retry count to be exceeded. For remote transfer configurations, the
   retry count setting can be altered within the ADMIN.EXE application via
   Ext-Admin, Setup, Options.

   Mailing retries before failure. The default value for this option is 3.

2. Shortly, afterwards you should receive an undeliverable message generated by
   External. Opening this system message will display your text without its
   original highlighted color attributes.
