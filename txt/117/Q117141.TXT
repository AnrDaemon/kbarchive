======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the version 4.0 printer driver for the Hewlett-Packard (HP)
DeskJet 500 Series by running the HP-supplied installation program (HPSETUP.EXE)
from File Manager, you receive the following error message:

   The module, COMMCTRL.DLL, is in use.
   Close down all applications and reinstall.

No other applications appear to be running. The load= and run= lines in the
WIN.INI file are blank.


CAUSE
=====

The HP installation program replaces PRINTMAN.EXE and COMMCTRL.DLL. COMMCTRL.DLL
contains internal custom control user interface functions. In Windows for
Workgroups versions 3.1 and 3.11, COMMCTRL.DLL is used by Windows File Manager.
This error occurs if Print Manager, File Manager, or Control Panel is running at
the same time as HPSETUP.EXE.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure you run HPSETUP.EXE from Program Manager and that File Manager is not
running.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. In Windows, open File Manager.

2. Double-click HPSETUP.EXE, or choose Run from the File menu and type
   HPSETUP.EXE in the Command Line box and then choose OK.
