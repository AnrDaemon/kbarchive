TITLE   :BUG: Conditional Breakpoints On Double Variables Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER::4.0,4.01,4.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.01, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Codeview for Windows may not break at the right location or may not break at all
if a conditional breakpoint is set on a variable of type double. Conditional
breakpoints include breakpoints such as "Break when Expression has Changed" and
"Break when Expression is True". Codeview for MS-DOS does not have this problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you have Visual C++, use the Visual Workbench debugger instead of Codeview
for Windows.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Codeview for Windows version
4.0, 4.01, and 4.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The program listed below can be used to demonstrate the problem. Build a debug
version of the program, load it into Codeview for Windows, and enter the
following commands in Codeview's command window:

   bp = x
   bp = y
   bp = z
   g ; breaks are either missed or break at wrong location

Sample Code
-----------

   /* Compile options needed:  /Zi /Od
   */ 

   #include <windows.h>

   double x, y, z;

   void f( void )
   {
       x++;
       y++;
       z++;
   }

   int PASCAL WinMain (HANDLE hInstance, HANDLE hPrevInstance,
              LPSTR lpszCmdLine, int nCmdShow)
   {
       f();
       return 0;
   }
