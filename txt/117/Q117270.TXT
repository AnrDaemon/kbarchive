TITLE   :Named Pipe Applications Without Network Adapter Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1 3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run an application that uses named pipes as an Interprocess
Communication (IPC) mechanism on a Windows NT computer without network support
installed, it fails to connect to the named pipe resource either locally or
remotely.

RESOLUTION
==========

For remote named pipe resources, the system must have a physical network card
installed. However, for local named pipe resources, you can install the
MSLoopback adapter driver for support.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MSLoopback driver provides the redirector for both the Win16 and Win32 named
pipe applications. Windows NT provides named pipes as one of the IPC mechanisms
for applications to share data either on the same computer or across the
network. Named pipes are implemented as a file system. All the calls to this
file system by WOW and Win32 resolve to the redirector. If there is no network
adapter installed, there is no redirector available for both 32-bit and 16-bit
applications, thus these applications fail.
