KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Cinemania for the Macintosh 1994 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Cinemania Demo requires at least 2.5 megabytes of free memory to run
correctly. If you have less than 2.5 megabytes of memory available, the Demo may
run without playing any sounds, or sound may cut out intermittently.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one or more of the following:

 - In the Monitors control panel, set your color bit depth to 256 colors instead
   of thousands or millions of colors. It takes more memory to run in thousands
   or millions of colors.

 - Don't start the Demo from inside Cinemania. Instead, exit from the
   application and start the Demo from the Cinemania 1994 Demo alias located in
   the Cinemania 1994 folder on your hard drive.

 - Reconfigure your memory to make more available. You can do this by changing
   your control panel memory settings, disabling INITs, and closing any other
   applications that may also be running. You can check the About This Macintosh
   dialog box under the Apple menu to make sure you have made enough memory
   available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Demo runs using the Macromedia Player. Because of the requirements of the
Macromedia Player in certain configurations (especially under millions of
colors), the Demo will occasionally need more memory to run.
