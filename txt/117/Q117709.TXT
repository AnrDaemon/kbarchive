TITLE   :PRB: BROWSE FIELDS Results Inconsistent in 1-to-Many Relation
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:2.0,2.5x,2.6,2.6a; WINDOWS:2.5x,2.6,2.6a,3.0

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6, 2.6a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5x, 2.6, 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The records in the child table of a one-to-many relationship do not update
properly under certain conditions.

RESOLUTION
==========

Issue a GO RECNO() command after returning to the parent table. This forces
FoxPro to refresh the one-to-many relationship, and allows the update of the
BROWSE results.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. FoxPro cannot know what the developer is attempting
to do, and allows the child table data to be read from wherever the record
pointer has moved. By refreshing the relationship between the two tables with
the GO RECNO() command, the developer is given the option to determine which
data should be returned from the child, the old information or the updated
information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create two physical tables as described below:

      PARENT.DBF                      CHILD.DBF
      -----------------------------------------------------------

      IDNO(C,5)   NAMES(C,10)         IDNO(C,5)      CITIES(C,10)
      111         Sam                 114            Fairbanks
      112         Mary                113            Houston
      113         Beth                115            Phoenix
      114         Larry               111            Dover
      115         Pat                 112            Buffalo
                                      111            Dallas
                                      112            Portland

2. Run the following code in a program. The name of the program does not
   matter.

         *Open up the tables, and set up the one-to-many relationship
         USE Parent IN 1
         USE Child IN 2
         SELECT Parent
         INDEX ON IDNO TAG IDNO
         SET ORDER TO IDNO
         SELECT Child
         INDEX ON IDNO TAG IDNO
         SET ORDER TO IDNO
         SELECT Parent
         SET RELATION TO idno INTO Child
         SET SKIP TO Child
         SELECT Parent

         *Information window, and the first BROWSE FIELDS command displays
         *correctly
         WAIT WINDOW "Please note how the tables line up appropriately." ;
            +CHR(13)+"Hit ESC to continue" NOWAIT
         BROWSE FIELDS parent.idno, parent.names, child.idno, child.cities

         *Select another record in the child for testing purposes, often a
         *SEEK() might be performed here in an actual meaningful program
         SELECT child
         GO BOTTOM

         *Reselect Parent table
         SELECT parent

         *Information window, and the incorrect results from the BROWSE
         *FIELDS command
         WAIT WINDOW "Now they don't appear right!!" + CHR(13)+ ;
            "Hit ESC to continue" NOWAIT
         BROWSE FIELDS parent.idno, parent.names, child.idno, child.cities

         *The resolution, an information window, and the corrected results
         *from the BROWSE FIELDS command
         GO RECNO()
         WAIT WINDOW "That fixed it !!" + CHR(13) + "Hit ESC to continue" ;
         NOWAIT
         BROWSE FIELDS parent.idno, parent.names, child.idno, child.cities
