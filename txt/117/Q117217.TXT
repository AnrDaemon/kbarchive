SUMMARY
=======

This article demonstrates the two methods you can use to search for specific
text in a memo field. The first method uses the Query Designer. The second
method programmatically searches a memo field of a database and highlights a
specific word or phrase. The program continues searching and highlighting all
occurrences within a memo field until all the matches are located.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Method 1
--------

This example uses the CLIENTS database in the SAMPLE\ORGANIZE\DBFS subdirectory
interactively using the Query Designer. Open the Query Designer (File, New,
Query), and select the drop-down box under fField Name in the Selection Criteria
dialog. Scroll to the bottom of the list of fields, and select
<EXPRESSION...>. In the Expression window, enter the following:
"ATC("msrchstr", Notes)."

In the Criteria drop-down box, select "More Than." In the Example textbox, type
"0" (zero). When the query is performed, the cursor returns the set of records
where the searched-for string occurs in the specified field at any location.

Method 2
--------

This code example uses the CLIENTS database in the SAMPLE\ORGANIZE\DBFS
subdirectory. Before executing the code, open the memo field of the first record
and type the following text:

   "This is a test of memo field text search program. If the test is successful,
   two occurrences will be found.."

After executing the program, type "test" (without the quotation marks) in the @
... GET field, and press the RETURN key. The program will open the Notes memo
field and highlight each occurrence of the word "test." The program will find
two instances of the string "test" within the memo field:

      SET TALK OFF
      msrchstr=SPACE(5)   && This variable can be any size. &&
      USE clients
      GO TOP
      @ 1,10 GET msrchstr
      READ
         msrchstr=ALLTRIM(msrchstr)
         m.occurrence=1
         DO WHILE .t.
         mfound=AT(msrchstr,Notes,m.occurrence)
            IF mfound > 0
               m.occurrence=m.occurrence+1
               MODI MEMO notes NOWAIT RANGE mfound,mfound+LEN(msrchstr)
               WAIT WINDOW 'Press any key to find next occurrence'
            ELSE
               WAIT WINDOW 'No more'
               EXIT
               ENDIF
         ENDDO
      SET TALK ON
