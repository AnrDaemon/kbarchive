TITLE   :BUG: Invalid "Argument List Doesn't Match A Function" Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER::4.0,4.01,4.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for MS-DOS, versions 4.0, 4.01, 4.1 
 - Microsoft CodeView for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.01, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Evaluating a C++ function in the Codeview command window using the function's
default parameter values will cause Codeview to give an error message stating
that the "argument list doesn't match a function", even though default
parameters have been specified in the code.

CAUSE
=====

The Codeview expression evaluator was not designed to process default arguments
for C++ functions. Therefore, it expects a C++ function to receive the exact
number of parameters specified in the function's formal parameter list.

RESOLUTION
==========

For Codeview to evaluate the function properly, you must include values for all
of the function's parameters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The sample code shown below can be used to demonstrate the problem. To see the
problem, follow these steps:

1. Build a debug version of the sample code.

2. Start a debugging session using Codeview, and run to the following
   statement:

   " e = f( d );" (without the quotation marks)

3. In the Codeview command window, enter the command ?f(3). This will cause the
   error message described above to be generated. However, entering the command
   ?f(3,10) will work since the expression evaluator expects f to receive two
   parameters.

Sample Code
-----------

   /* Compile options needed: /Zi /Od /Tp
   */ 

   int f( int a, int b = 0 )
   {
       return (a + b);
   }

   void main( void )
   {
       int d = 5,  e;
       e = f( d );
   }
