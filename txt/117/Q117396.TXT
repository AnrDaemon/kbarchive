PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1

KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

With Microsoft Client Service for Netware, you can set printing options that
control form feeds, print notification, and banner pages. By default, the form
feed is suppressed and you are notified after your print job is completed and an
initial banner page is printed. The printing option settings are equivalent to
those available directly on the NetWare server using the capture utility.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To set printing options, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, choose the Client Service for NetWare option.

2. In the Print Options box:

   a. Select the Add Form Feed check box to eject a page at the end of each
      print job.

   b. Clear the Notify When Printed check box to prevent a notice from being
      displayed on your Windows NT computer when your document has been printed.

   c. Clear the Print Banner check box to prevent a banner page from being
      printed before each print job.

3. When the printing options are as you want them, choose OK.
