The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS, version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

With Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS, if you use the NET SHARE command to share your
printer and you then change to the floppy disk drive by typing A: or B:, the
light for the floppy disk drive stays on until you type a drive letter other
than the letter of the floppy disk drive you are currently using.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS
version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although the light stays on, you do not lose any functionality by using your
floppy disk drives. You can still change floppy disks and be able to access
files on the new disk.
