TITLE   :PC Win: Missing Message Text When Sending to a Large Group
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.0,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, when sending mail
such that the number of recipients is greater than 200 (the exact number depends
on the specific address list), the body of the message will be missing.

CAUSE
=====

A boundary condition occurred when the message was slightly smaller than 8192
bytes that caused the Windows client to assume it had already processed the body
text when it actually had not. This caused the body text to be lost.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0 and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows. This problem was corrected in version 3.2a (which
includes MSSFS.DLL version 3.2.0.4074).
