SUMMARY
=======

Under certain conditions, you may want to terminate an MFC application
programatically. MFC does not provide a public function to gracefully exit an
application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A method for dealing with this is to create a function in your application like
the following:

      void ExitApp()
      {
           // same as double-clicking on main window close box
           ASSERT(AfxGetApp()->m_pMainWnd != NULL);
           AfxGetApp()->m_pMainWnd->SendMessage(WM_CLOSE);
      }

As you can see, this is implemented as a global function, which can be called
from anywhere in your application. It simply sends a WM_CLOSE message to your
application's mainframe window. This initiates an orderly shutdown of the
application.

If you are using MFC, version 2.5 or later, you can take advantage of a new
global MFC function, "AfxGetMainWnd", to simplify the code:

      void ExitMFCApp()
      {
           // same as double-clicking on main window close box
           ASSERT(AfxGetMainWnd() != NULL);
           AfxGetMainWnd()->SendMessage(WM_CLOSE);
      }

NOTE: Always call CDocument::SetModifiedFlag() after changing your document data.
This will ensure that the framework prompts the user to save before shutdown. If
you need more extensive control over the shutdown procedure, you can override
CDocument::SaveModified().
