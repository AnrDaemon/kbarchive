KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for MS-DOS, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Microsoft Mail Remote for MS-DOS to send mail to groups with external
postoffice user addresses, the mail disappears and the Remote client does not
get a non-delivery report.

CAUSE
=====

The Remote client uses the External program to resolve group addresses, which
does not work with external users in groups. The Remote client is the only
client affected by this limitation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this as a problem with version 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft
Mail Remote for MS-DOS. We are researching this problem and will post
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
