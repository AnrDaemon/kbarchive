TITLE   :BUG: CONTROL+C, CONTROL+X, & CONTROL+V Don't Always Work
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.5b,2.5c,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenvkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The FoxPro for Windows and MS-DOS shortcut keys that use the CONTROL (CTRL) key
combined with C, X, or V for copying, cutting, and pasting don't work in all
areas of FoxPro for Macintosh.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the COMMAND key instead of the CONTROL key for these shortcuts. (The COMMAND
key usually has the picture of the Apple logo and a clover-leaf on it).

The CONTROL key is not the standard modifier key for these actions on the
Macintosh, the COMMAND key is. Hence, the COMMAND key can be used in more
places.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FoxPro versions 2.5b and 2.5c
for Macintosh.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In FoxPro for Windows and MS-DOS, the CTRL shortcut key combinations work
consistently in all components to copy, cut, or paste objects and text. The key
combination CTRL+C performs a copy, CTRL+X performs a cut, and CTRL+V performs a
paste operation.

The SET KEYCOMP setting has no effect on this behavior.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. In the Command window, type "MODIFY FILE" (without the quotation marks).

2. In the "Untitled" file window, type "TEST" (without the quotation marks) then
   select it.

3. Press CONTROL+C to copy the selection.

4. From the File menu, choose Save As.

5. In the Save Document As text box, press CONTROL+V.

Note that a hollow box appears on the screen, rather than the text copied in step
3. However, pressing COMMAND+V will paste "TEST" into the Save Document As text
box.
