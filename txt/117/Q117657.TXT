TITLE   :Windows 95 May Not Start After Setup to Clean Directory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows 95 in a directory other than the current Windows
directory, Windows 95 does not start; instead, the boot process invokes the
previous version of Windows, or the system stops responding (hangs) after the
Windows logo screen is displayed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the previous version of Windows is automatically loaded
at startup using the following commands in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   CD\<Windows directory>
   WIN

When you are installing Windows 95, Setup creates the AUTOEXEC.W40 file based on
the existing AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Windows 95 removes the command to load the
previous version of Windows (that is, WIN) but fails to remove the change
directory command. In this configuration, Windows 95 executes the WIN command
from the c:\<Windows directory> and starts the previous version of
Windows.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

1. Restart your computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, press
   the F8 key, and then choose Step-By-Step Confirmation from the Startup menu.

2. Answer Yes to all prompts except the CD\<Windows directory> prompt;
   answer No to this prompt. (This allows Windows 95 to start.)

3. Click the Start button, then click Run.

4. On the command line, type "wordpad c:\autoexec.bat" (without the quotation
   marks).

5. Remove or remark out the CD\<Windows directory> command. For example:

   rem cd \windows

6. Save the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and shut down the system.

Windows 95 should now restart properly.
