filters is from the PowerPoint 4.0 Readme Help file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows Bitmaps and Metafiles (.BMP, .WMF)

   PowerPoint supports Windows bitmap (BMP) files and Windows metafiles (WMF)
   directly, without a separate graphic filter. These filters are required by
   other Microsoft products, such as Microsoft ClipArt Gallery. WMF files must
   be in the Aldus Placeable Metafile format (which contains a header with org
   and ext information).

   Aldus and Micrografx have created an extended version of the Windows Metafile
   Format called the "Placeable Metafile Format." In this extended format, 22
   bytes of information have been added to the standard metafile header. This
   information allows the metafile to specify how the metafile is to be placed
   and sized.

   The WMF filter rejects files that do not have the correct key, checksum,
   bounding rectangle, and/or enough data in the file.

NOTE: PowerPoint 7.0 can only import .wmf files that are in the Aldus Placeable
Metafile format. If you try to import a Windows Metafile that does not have a
header, you receive this message:

   Sorry, "<filename.wmf>" is damaged and cannot be read.
