TITLE   :PC Ext: IMPORT.EXE Autocreate Fails if EXTERNAL.EXE Running
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, running IMPORT.EXE
with the autocreate option turned on, can fail against a postoffice with
EXTERNAL.EXE running against it in high mail traffic situations. IMPORT.EXE
reports:

   Fatal [59] Error autocreating postoffice: XXXXXXXXXX

CAUSE
=====

EXTERNAL.EXE opens the *.XTN files as "Read-Share Deny Write" while IMPORT.EXE
is trying to write to them. Under normal circumstances, EXTERNAL.EXE keeps an
.XTN file open for a very short interval, so the problem is avoided.

WORKAROUND
==========

Try increasing the IntervalRegular time (or -n<time>) parameter on
EXTERNAL.EXE so that it checks the postoffice and locks the XTN files less
frequently.

The autocreate IMPORT.EXE problem is less likely with low mail traffic
postoffices because the EXTERNAL.EXE program is not delivering as many messages
and requires shorter periods of access to XTN files.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0 and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. This problem was corrected in EXTERNAL.EXE
version 3.2.8. If you do not have version 3.2.8 (or later), you can download
