The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

From the POSIX Shell (SH.EXE), you may not be able to run any of the POSIX
utilities.

CAUSE
=====

In the POSIX subsystem the path and executable name must be completely
specified. For example, if the file, LS.EXE is in the current directory, but
that directory is not in the path, to execute the file, you must type:

   .\LS.EXE

NOTE: The POSIX subsystem is case sensitive.

WORKAROUND
==========

Binary files executed within the POSIX shell must be in a directory identified
in the PATH statement. Use the PATH command to add the appropriate directory to
the path environment variable before you execute the POSIX shell.

- or -

Specify the complete path (case sensitive) at the POSIX command line.

NOTE: See Q100625 for more information on POSIX and case sensitivity.
