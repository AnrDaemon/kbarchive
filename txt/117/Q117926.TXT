-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Cinemania for the Macintosh 1994 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you reinstall Cinemania, the installer creates a Temp folder and installs a
cleanup INIT in the System folder. However, after completing the reinstallation,
the Setup program does not delete these items. Altogether they take up 2.5
megabytes (MB) of hard disk space.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the installer for Microsoft
Cinemania 1994 for the Macintosh. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

After completing the reinstallation of Cinemania, open the System folder and
delete the leftover Temp folder and cleanup INIT.
