SYMPTOMS
========

When installing Encarta, you may receive an insufficient memory error message
even if you do have the necessary 4 megabytes of RAM. This problem can occur if
there is a large object taking up most of the Clipboard space. The Installer
needs to use System memory that can be consumed by the Clipboard if it is
storing something large.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, do one of the following:

 - Clear the Clipboard.

   -or-

 - Copy something small (this overwrites the large item in the Clipboard).

You should now be able to install Encarta.

For more information about memory usage with Encarta, refer to the Encarta and
Memory readme file.
