-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running Codeview for DOS or CodeView for Windows in 43 or 50 line mode and
paging up to the top and then down again in a maximized source window, a GP
Fault may occur. When running Codeview for DOS outside of Windows, you can get
run-time error R6915 followed by DOSX16: unhandled exception.

If a GFP does not immediately occur, you may experience subsequent display
problems such as a loss of source code lines and/or register corruption.

RESOLUTION
==========

Run Codeview in 25 line mode, or use the mouse to scroll the source window.

STATUS
======

in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
