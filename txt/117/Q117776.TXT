PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Cinemania for the Macintosh 1994 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Foreign language or special characters in the text of a review or cast list may
display as boxes or as some other incorrect character.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because of a conflict between the appropriate Lucida font
(installed with Cinemania) and another font previously installed on the system.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, do the following:

1. Delete the V Lucida Sans font suitcase.

2. Using Finder, reinstall the V Lucida Sans font suitcase from the Cinemania
   CD.

3. Use Finder to reinstall any add-on font packages.

The special and foreign characters should now display correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Apple system fonts are assigned certain ID numbers. When add-on fonts are
installed, they must use ID numbers in a different range than that reserved for
the system fonts. Sometimes a conflict can occur when a program other than the
Finder (for example, an application's installer program) designates the add-on
fonts' ID numbers. Allowing Finder to reset these ID numbers corrects the
problem.
