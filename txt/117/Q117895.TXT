TITLE   :PC Adm: 007 Error Caused by Missing .MEM File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The External Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE) generates the following error in the
SYSTEM.LOG file if it tries to deliver mail to a postoffice group for which
there is no .MEM file:

   [007] Message addressed to group that no longer exists.

NOTE: This message is misleading in that the group clearly exists when the
administrator checks for the group using the Mail Administrator program.

CAUSE
=====

If the administrator deletes a user who was the only local member of a group
containing local and external members, the program will delete the .MEM file.

MOVEUSER.EXE will also cause the .MEM file to be deleted if the last member of a
group is deleted from within MOVEUSER.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, remove users from Groups prior to deleting them. The
Admin, Group Modify function does not delete the .MEM file.

To recover from the problem:

1. Start the Mail Administrator program and select Local-Admin, Group, Modify.

2. Select the group that was mentioned in the error message in the SYSTEM.LOG
   file.

3. Press the ENTER key (do not press ESC) and continue to press ENTER at the
   prompts. This will re-create the zero-byte .MEM file.

NOTE: If a modification of the group occurs, addressing mail to the group from
the Global Address List (GAL) will be invalid until the GAL is rebuilt.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Ordinarily, the .MEM file contains a mailbag list of the local postoffice users
who are members of the group. It is acceptable to have a zero-byte .MEM file. In
fact, a zero-byte .MEM file is created for groups that only have members at
other postoffices.

The MOVEUSER utility is provided with MVUSR.EXE on the Microsoft Software Library
(MSL).
