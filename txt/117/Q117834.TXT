TITLE   :FIX: Wrong Output Library Name Used with VCNT Makefile
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbide kbVCkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Workbench for Windows, version 1.0, used with:
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the makefile created by the Visual Workbench for Windows NT on a
command line, or as an external makefile to build a static library, the output
library name is not formed as the project name plus the .LIB extension. Instead,
the library name is formed using the base name of the first object module
specified on the output-dependency line in the makefile.

RESOLUTION
==========

Currently, there are not any flags that can be set from the Visual Workbench to
change this behavior. However, you can use the following workarounds by
modifying the makefile directly:

 - Add option /OUT to the section in the makefile that is creating the response
   file. For example:

       echo >NUL @<<$(PROJ).CRF
         /OUT:$(PROJ).lib
         module1.obj
         module2.obj
         ...

-or-

 - Add option /OUT on the link line where the LIB.EXE file is being invoked. For
   example:

         link -LIB /OUT:$(PROJ).lib @$(PROJ).CRF

-or-

 - Create a batch file to rename the library.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the products listed at the beginning
of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 2.0.
