-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Cinemania for the Macintosh 1994 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Cinemania Demo's appearance is significantly less attractive if you run it
on a monochrome system. The demo will run only on color or true monochrome
systems, not on color systems on which the monitor has been set to monochrome
mode.

If you set a color system to black and white and try to run the Demo, the
following message appears:

   This demo requires 256 colors or more.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The system requirements list on the Cinemania box and in its readme file
specifies that Cinemania requires a 13-inch or larger monitor running 256 or
more colors to run correctly.

Additional query words: mac 1994 multi media multimedia multi-media display video b&w screen ugly distorted scrammbled poor resolution quality bad yucky
