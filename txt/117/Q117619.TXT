The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Windows for Workgroups, you cannot specify a
universal naming convention (UNC) name as the working directory for an
application in the Program Item Properties dialog box. This limitation also
applies to the startup directory specified in program information files (PIFs)
for MS-DOS-based applications.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Network users can refer to a network resource by its UNC name (typically in the
form \\<SERVER>\<SHARE> for Microsoft networks) without associating
that connection with a drive letter. Although this is valid for some
applications, Windows and Windows for Workgroups use the working (or startup)
directory by attempting to change to that directory. Since it is not valid to
change the directory to a UNC name, the operation fails.

If a UNC name is listed as the working directory in the Program Item Properties
dialog box, Windows may generate an error message indicating that the working
directory is invalid. If a UNC name is used in the startup directory of an
MS-DOS-based application's PIF, Windows may generate an error message indicating
that the startup directory was not found.

If you must have a working or startup directory pointing to a network share,
associate a drive letter with the connection and then use the associated drive
letter rather than the UNC as the working or startup directory. Note that when a
network drive is used as the working directory, Windows or Windows for
Workgroups may generate warning messages indicating that the application may not
always be available (because the network is unavailable, the network drive
letter is changed or deleted, and so forth.)
