SUMMARY
=======

A query with an ORDER BY clause will be considerably slower than the same query
without the ORDER BY clause.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The query times will vary based on the size of the database queried and the
hardware involved. However, the times illustrated below show a considerable
difference between querying with and without an ORDER BY clause.

When an ORDER BY clause is used, a new database is being generated by the query.
Display status will show "table in use" as a table with a .TMP extension.
Without the ORDER BY clause, the original database is used to generate the
cursor query. Display status will show "table in use as the original table."

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open a database with 10,000 records or more and open an RQBE window.

2. Make sure an index exists for the field on which the query will be based, and
   then query without an ORDER BY clause. (In our test with a 10,000-record
   database, the query time shown in the status bar was 0.10 seconds.)

3. Query with an ORDER BY clause based on a different field. (In our test on the
   same database, the query time shown in the status bar was 17.68 seconds.)
