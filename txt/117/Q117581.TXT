-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Version 3.2 of the Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks
rejects all mail messages sent from the PC to the Macintosh with subject lines
longer than 63 characters and places them in the Badmail directory. Messages
with subject lines 63 characters or shorter are delivered.

RESOLUTION
==========

To deliver this message to its intended recipient, the Mail Administrator must:

1. Modify the message with a text file editor.

2. Reduce the Subject: line to 63 characters or less.

3. Save the edited message with a MMFF#.MSG filename.

   NOTE: The actual filename can be (MMFF1.MSG, MMFF2.MSG,..., MMFFx.MSG) where x
   is the blocking factor.

   Also make sure that the chosen filename is unique, so that it does not write
   over another MMFF#.MSG file.

4. Place the message in the PCTOMAC directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample MMFF#.MSG file would be rejected and placed in the Badmail
directory:
