SUMMARY
=======

Audio Plus and Audio Plus II cards, by Zoltrix, support compressed audio, when
they are configured to use the SoundBlaster drivers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The above mentioned applications use the Microsoft Audio Compression Manager to
produce sounds.

To install the SoundBlaster driver, use the driver disk that accompanies the
Audio Plus or Audio Plus II card. This includes the SNDBLST2.DRV file.

You will need to edit the SYSTEM.INI file; it can be opened in any text editor,
such as the Windows Notepad or the MS-DOS Editor.

Below are sections of the SYSTEM.INI file that include the setup for the sound
card. The port (I/O Base Address), INT (interrupt/IRQ), and DMACHANNEL (DMA
channel) settings may be different, depending on the settings on the sound
card.

   [Drivers]
      MIDI=apdev.drv
      Wave=apdev.drv
      MIDI1=apmus.drv

      [apdev.drv]
      port=220
      int=7
      dmachannel=1

      [apmus.drv]
      port=220

The Zoltrix 16 cards will play compressed audio if you edit the above sections of
the SYSTEM.INI file to look like the entries listed below. You may have to add
the [sndblst2.drv] and [MSACM] sections. A semicolon (;) in the SYSTEM.INI file
indicates that the line is a comment and the information will not load into
memory.

      [Drivers]
      ;MIDI=apdev.drv
      ;Wave=apdev.drv
      ;MIDI1=apmus.drv
      Wave1=sndblst2.drv
      MIDI2=sndblst2.drv

      ;[apdev.drv]
      ;port=220
      ;int=7
      ;dmachannel=1

      ;[apmus.drv]
      ;port=220

      [sndblst2.drv]
      port=220
      int=7
