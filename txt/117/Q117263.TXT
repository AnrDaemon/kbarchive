Traditionally, to clear the text of a MaskedEdit control, you would set
the control's Mask Property to an empty string, and then set its text
property to an empty string:

      MaskedEdit1.Mask = ""
      MaskedEdit1.Text  = ""

Here's a better method. Modify the Mask property according to the following
steps. Then assign the Mask property to the text property of the MaskedEdit
control:

1. Replace Every occurrence of the pound sign (#) or question mark (?) in the
   Mask string with an underscore (_). The underscore is the default value for
   PromptChar.

2. Retain the literal characters and any spaces in the Mask string in their
   original positions.

For Example, if the Mask property has this value:

   (###) ###-#### Ext(#####)

and the PromptChar value is an underscore (_), use the following piece of
code to clear all the text and set the focus back to the MaskedEdit
control:

      MaskedEdit1.Text = "(___) ___-____ Ext(_____)"
      MaskedEdit1.SetFocus

Additional query words: 3.00 formatted format MaskEdit Masked Edit
