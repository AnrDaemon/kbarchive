======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you add the line DOS=UMB to the CONFIG.SYS file, only one MS-DOS command
can be executed before hard disk access is lost on a SCSI hard disk drive
controlled by a Ultrastor 34F local bus SCSI controller.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if DOS=UMB appears in the CONFIG.SYS file before the
Ultrastor SCSI device driver, USPI14.SYS.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, edit the CONFIG.SYS file and add USPI14.SYS before the
line DOS=UMB.

If the USPI14.SYS file is not currently available, remark out the DOS=UMB line in
the CONFIG.SYS until the file can be loaded.
