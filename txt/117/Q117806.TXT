SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the Microsoft DoubleSpace Conversion Kit (DBLCONV.EXE)
and how to obtain and install it. The DoubleSpace Conversion Kit enables you to
convert DoubleSpace-compressed drives to DriveSpace format. DBLCONV.EXE is a
self-extracting executable file that contains the following files:

   DRVSPACE.MR1
   README.TXT
   SETUP.EXE
   DBLCDESC.TXT

NOTE: If you installed MS-DOS 6.22 Step-Up, you should already have the
DRVSPACE.MR1 file in your DOS directory and therefore do not need to obtain this
conversion kit.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Description
-----------

The DoubleSpace Conversion Kit provides the DRVSPACE.MR1 file. If you used MS-DOS
6 or 6.2 before installing MS-DOS 6.22, the DRVSPACE.MR1 file enables MS-DOS to
read data stored in the DoubleSpace compression format even if the DoubleSpace
driver (DBLSPACE.BIN) is not loaded in memory.

DRVSPACE.MR1 makes it possible to:

 - Convert DoubleSpace-compressed drives to DriveSpace format.

 - Use DriveSpace to mount and read DoubleSpace-compressed drives.

 - Use MS-DOS 6.22 ScanDisk to check and repair DoubleSpace-compressed drives
   and compressed volume files (CVFs), even if DBLSPACE.BIN is not loaded in
   memory.

 - Use MS-DOS 6.22 Backup for MS-DOS to restore backups created with MS-DOS 6 or
   6.2 Backup for MS-DOS or Windows, even if DBLSPACE.BIN is not loaded in
   memory.

IMPORTANT: DRVSPACE.MR1 works in conjunction with the MS-DOS DBLSPACE.BIN file.
If you did not install MS-DOS 6.22 over MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2, you do not have the
DBLSPACE.BIN file.

If you did not install MS-DOS 6.22 over MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2, you can obtain the
DBLSPACE.BIN file from online services. For information about obtain- ing the
DBLSPACE.BIN file, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
