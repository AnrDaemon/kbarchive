The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Macintosh uses three types of fonts: bitmap, TrueType, and PostScript.
TrueType and PostScript fonts are scalable fonts. Bitmap fonts are fixed- size
raster fonts.

In System 7.1, all fonts are located in the System Folder:Fonts folder.

   Font type       Icon                     File kind/type
   --------------------------------------------------------

   Bitmap          Document with "A"        Font
   TrueType        Document with 3 "A"s     Font
   PostScript      Printer                  PostScript Font

NOTE: The bitmap and TrueType font files may actually be located in a "font
suitcase" file. You will need to open the "font suitcase" file to view the
individual font files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can see an example of any font by double-clicking the font file.

Bitmap Fonts
------------

Bitmap fonts always have a specific font size included in their names (a
different bitmap font file is needed for each point size.) Their icons are the
document icon (a page with the top left corner turned over) containing a single
letter "A." Their file kind/type is Font. In System 7.0, they are located in the
System file; in System 7.1, they are in the System Folder:Fonts folder.

TrueType Fonts
--------------

TrueType fonts also use document icons (a page with the top left corner turned
over). However, the icons contain three letter "A"s of different sizes, which
represents that the font is scalable. Their file kind/type is Font. In System
7.0, they are located in the System file; in System 7.1, they are in the System
Folder:Fonts folder. TrueType fonts are located in the same place as bitmap
fonts.

PostScript Fonts
----------------

PostScript fonts use an icon of a printer, which shows a page coming out of the
top. The page will contain the number "1" or "3," which indicates whether it is
a Type 1 or Type 3 PostScript font. Their file kind/type is PostScript Font. In
System 7.0, they are located in the System Folder:Extensions folder; in System
7.1, they are in the System Folder:Fonts folder.
