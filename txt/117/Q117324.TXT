SUMMARY
=======

When making changes to a project, it is common to choose Scan All Dependencies
from the Project menu periodically to ensure that the dependency list is
current. If the changes that were made to the files in the project have not been
saved before doing a dependency scan, new dependencies are not reflected.

A dependency scan does not automatically save modifications to the files in a
project. Choosing Save All from the File menu before choosing Scan All
Dependencies ensures that the dependency list is updated.

This behavior has changed starting with Visual C++ 2.0.
