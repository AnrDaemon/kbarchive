======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Cinemania for the Macintosh 1994 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to install Macintosh Cinemania under System 6.0, the system may stop
responding (hang) when you run Setup. This problem occurs if the system
components, such as Sound Manager and QuickTime, have not been previously
installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, use Cinemania with version 7.0 or later of the Macintosh
System software. Macintosh Cinemania requires System 7.0 or later to run
correctly. The Cinemania product box and CD booklet both include this in the
list of system requirements.
