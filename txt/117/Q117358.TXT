KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

As Windows 95 is loading, you receive the following error message:

   An error occurred while trying to initialize the video adapter. Press any key
   to continue.

Pressing a key has no effect; however, CTRL+ALT+DEL does reboot the system.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if you are using an incompatible or incorrect Windows 3.1
video driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, change your video driver back to the default Windows 95
VGA setting. To do this, first restart your computer and press the F5 key when
the "Starting Windows" message appears on your screen. This allows you to bypass
your startup files and start Windows 95 in Safe mode.

To change your video driver back to VGA:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Display icon.

   NOTE: You can skip steps 1 and 2 if you click the desktop with the right
   (secondary) mouse button and then click Properties.

3. Click the Settings tab.

4. Click the Change Display Type button, then click the Change button for the
   Adapter Type.

5. Click Standard Graphics Adapter (VGA), then click OK. When asked whether to
   use the current driver or a new driver, click Current.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you want to use a high-resolution video driver with Windows 95, consult your
video adapter manufacturer for the proper driver to use.
