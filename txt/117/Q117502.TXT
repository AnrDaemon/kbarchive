======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to connect to another computer using Remote Access Services (RAS)
in Windows for Workgroups 3.11, you receive the following error:

   Error 652 Unrecognized Text Response: <cr> <lf> 9600/ARQ/V32/LAPM
   <cr> <lf>

NOTE: The text following the message "Unrecognized Text Response" varies.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because the text received from the host computer was not
recognized by the remote computer. When you connect to a host computer using
RAS, the text response from the host computer is compared to the [Responses]
section of the MODEM.INF file, which is located in the Windows SYSTEM
subdirectory. If a match cannot be found, this error is generated.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the problem is not cause by poor line quality or interference, you can work
around this problem by adding the text from the error message to the [Responses]
section of the MODEM.INF file. The text from the error message should be added
after "CONNECT_EC=", as in the following example, which uses the text from the
above error message:

   CONNECT_EC=<cr><lf>CONNECT
   <connectbps>/ARQ/V32/LAPM<cr><lf>

NOTE: Replacing 9600 with <connectbps> allows RAS to connect at any speed.

This information should be added on its own separate line in the [Responses]
section of the MODEM.INF file.


If you add this information to the MODEM.INF file and you still receive the
error, you may have a corrupted MODEM.INF file. Delete your existing MODEM.INF,
make a copy from the original disks, and then make the modifications again.
