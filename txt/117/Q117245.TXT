The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If a regular or manual installation of MS-DOS fails because SETUP.EXE does not
run correctly, you may be able to use a batch file called EXPALL.BAT to perform
a successful manual installation. EXPALL.BAT is discussed on pages 553-554 of
the Microsoft Windows 3.0 "User's Guide." This file was originally designed to
perform a network installation of Windows 3.0. In the steps below, it has been
adapted to perform an installation of MS-DOS to the C:\DOS subdirectory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Boot your machine with Disk 1 (Setup) of the MS-DOS disk set you are
   upgrading to by inserting the disk in drive A and pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL. When
   the message "Starting MS-DOS ..." appears on the screen, press the F5 key to
   bypass MS-DOS Setup.

   IMPORTANT: If your Disk 1 fits in drive B only, you must first install MS-DOS
   to a floppy disk in drive A (use the command B:\SETUP /F). Then boot with the
   floppy disk created in drive A and follow the above instructions. If SETUP /F
   does not run, you must obtain a copy of MS-DOS that is the same media type as
   your boot disk drive and then perform step 1.

2. Transfer the MS-DOS system files to the hard disk drive with the following
   command:

      a:sys c:

3. Make sure Disk 1 is no longer in drive A. Reboot your machine from the hard
   disk drive, and press F5 when the message "Starting MS-DOS ..." appears on
   the screen to ensure no unnecessary drivers are loaded.

4. Create the directory C:\DOS.

NOTE: We do not recommended that you copy files from the disk created with the
SETUP /F command to C:\DOS because all MS-DOS files are not present on that
disk.

1. Copy EXPAND.EXE from the MS-DOS Disk 1 (Setup) to the C:\DOS directory.

2. Change to the C:\DOS directory on the hard disk, and create EXPALL.BAT with
   COMMAND.COM by typing the following lines (be sure to press ENTER after each
   line):

   " COPY CON EXPALL.BAT
   %1
   FOR %%i IN (*.*) DO C:\DOS\EXPAND %%i C:\DOS\%%i
   C:
   CTRL + Z " (without the quotation marks)

3. Run EXPALL.BAT with the source disk drive indicated (such as EXPALL A: or
   EXPALL B:). The command must be repeated for each disk you are installing.

4. Rename the files expanded to the C:\DOS directory from their compressed names
   to their decompressed filenames.

   a. First rename the following files:

   rename dblspace.in_ dblspace.inf
   rename memmaker.in_ memmaker.inf

   b. Perform the following commands to rename the remaining files:

      rename *.38_ *.386
      rename *.bi_ *.bin
      rename *.co_ *.com
      rename *.cp_ *.cpi
      rename *.dl_ *.dll
      rename *.ex_ *.exe
      rename *.ov_ *.ovl
      rename *.sy_ *.sys
      rename *.tx_ *.txt
      rename *.gr_ *.grp
      rename *.hl_ *.hlp
      rename *.ls_ *.lst
      rename *.pr_ *.pro

5. Copy the files WINA20.386 and DBLSPACE.BIN (or DRVSPACE.BIN in MS-DOS 6.22)
   to the root directory, and set the attributes of DBLSPACE.BIN or DRVSPACE.BIN
   to Hidden, System, and Read-Only by using the ATTRIB command as follows:

      c:\dos\attrib c:\???space.bin +r +s +h
