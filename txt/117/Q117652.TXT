SYMPTOMS
========

In version 1.0 of Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, if you follow the
instructions for creating a Reply Form in the Developer's Guide (pages 112-115)
the Sender's name does not appear on the Read Reply Form (frmReadReply).

CAUSE
=====

There is no code in the ReadMessage procedure defined in EFORM.BAS to handle
adding the Sender name to the Read Reply form (frmReadReply).

RESOLUTION
==========

To include the Sender's name in the Read Reply Form, follow this procedure to
add code to the ReadMessage procedure defined in EFORM.BAS:

1. Open the E-form project in Visual Basic.

2. From the Project window, select EFORM.BAS.

3. Click the View Code button.

4. From the Procedure list box, select ReadMessage.

5. Add the following code to process frmReadReply:

      If frm Is frmReadReply Then
         frm!txtOriginator = gOriginator.Name
         ' Check and see if the form has been saved since it was received
         modified = MEFReadLong(gPackage, "modified", 0)
         If modified <> 0 Then
           frm!lblFrom = "*&From:"
         End If
         frm!txtDateReceived = MEFFormatMAPIDate(gMessage.DateReceived)
      End If

6. Save the project.

7. From the File menu, choose "Make EXE file" to build the new E-form
   executable.
