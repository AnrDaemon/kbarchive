SUMMARY
=======

When you are distributing an application created with FoxPro for Macintosh, you
may need to distribute the Apple Shared Library Manager (ASLM) with the
application. For example, if the application calls Macintosh libraries created
with the FoxPro for Macintosh Library Construction Kit (LCK), the Apple Shared
Library Manager must be distributed with the application in order to take
advantage of these features.

To legally distribute the ASLM with FoxPro for Macintosh applications, you must
obtain a license from Apple Computer. To apply for a license, call the Apple
Legal Department at (408) 974-4667, or send a request to the sw.license alias on
AppleLink.

NOTE: Some products mentioned in this article are manufactured by vendors
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.
