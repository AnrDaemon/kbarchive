SYMPTOMS
========

If you pause an animation that has an accompanying soundtrack, the sound may not
resume when you resume playback of the animation. If the animation contains more
than one sequence, the sound may start playing again at the beginning of the
next sequence. Depending on the length of the animation and the point at which
you paused it, the sound may take anywhere between a few seconds to a full
minute to begin playing again.

This behavior is due to a limitation of the MacroMedia Player.
