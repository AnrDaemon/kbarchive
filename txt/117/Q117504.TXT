The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you complete a network setup of Windows 3.1 (SETUP /N) and you later try
to perform a maintenance-mode setup for Windows 3.1 from your Windows directory,
you are prompted to perform a full installation, and you are not allowed to make
any changes to the system settings.

CAUSE
=====

Three files must be present in the Windows directory in order to run
maintenance-mode setup. These files are WIN.COM, SETUP.EXE, and WINVER.EXE. You
experience problems if all three files are not present. When you perform a
network installation of Windows using the SETUP/N command, the setup routine
places a minimal number of Windows files in the local Windows directory.
SETUP.EXE, by default, is not installed in the local Windows directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, copy SETUP.EXE to the local Windows directory from Disk
1 of the Windows distribution disk set or from the shared Windows directory.
