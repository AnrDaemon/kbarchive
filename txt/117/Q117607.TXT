======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, 16-bit edition, versions 1.0, 1.5 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use classes derived from the common dialog classes (for example
CFileDialog) in the MFC, DDX member variables do not get updated when you choose
the "OK" button. The reason for this is that the base class "OnOK()", provided
for these classes, does not call UpdateData(). For example, CFileDialog::OnOK()
does not call UpdateData().

RESOLUTION
==========

The workaround for this is to override OnOK() in your derived class and call
UpdateData(). See CDialog::OnOK() in <drive>:\MSVC\MFC\SRC\DLGCORE.CPP for
an example of how to set up the code and message-map entry.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the MFC, versions 2.0 and 2.5.
This problem was corrected in MFC version 3.0, included with Visual C++ version
2.0.
