The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft provides MMFCLEAN.EXE, Windows-based application to be used on
Microsoft Mail 3.0 and later postoffices to purge mail from mail message files
(MMFs).

For complete information about obtaining and installing MMFCLEAN.EXE, see the
following sections:

 - To download the utility

 - To install MMFCLEAN.EXE

MORE INFORMATION
================

Currently, there is no way for an administrator to monitor or manage space
consumed by a Windows or OS/2 Mail user on a version 3.0 or later Microsoft Mail
postoffice (PO). In versions of Microsoft Mail earlier than version 3.0, the
administrator could purge mail messages for all users on the PO. When the mail
message file (MMF) architecture of versions 3.0 and later of Microsoft Mail for
Windows was introduced, the administrator lost the ability to purge mail
messages stored in the MMFs.

The MMFCLEAN utility is a Windows-based application to be used on Microsoft Mail
3.0 and later postoffices to purge mail from MMFs. MMFs usually exist on the PO
and contain the users' private mail messages and folders. There is one MMF per
Windows user on the PO. By default, the Windows user will have his or her MMF
file stored on the PO, but the user can choose to store the MMF file on his or
her local machine. The MMFCLEAN utility matches the capability of the Mail
Administrator program. The administrator should run it from a Windows 3.0 or
3.1, or Windows for Workgroups 3.1 or 3.11 local area network (LAN) client
connected to the PO over the network.

You can use the MMFCLEAN utility to clean the MMF according to the following
criteria:

 - Message Age days

 - All messages with size greater than XXX

 - Message priority

Things to Note Before Running MMFCLEAN
--------------------------------------

WARNING: Before you use the MMFCLEAN utility to clean the database, make an
additional backup copy of your Microsoft Mail postoffice. If an error occurs
during a fix, you can restore the backup made immediately before you used the
MMFCLEAN utility. In all other circumstances, you should restore the database
from your most recent regularly scheduled backup.

 - Available disk space should be three times the size of the largest MMF.

 - Do not use an active PO; all users should be logged off and the PO should be
   backed up.

 - File Scan is required for Novell networks.

 - MMFs not stored on the PO will not be included; any MMFs stored on a user's
   local drive or on another server will not be cleaned.

 - No other Mail application should be running on the workstation when you start
   the MMFCLEAN utility.

 - The Just Compress check box in the Criteria dialog box overrides all other
   criteria. Remember that when a cleaning is done, a compress is also
   automatically done.

   Important: When MMFCLEAN does comparisons on the aging date, the creation date
   of the message is used instead of the date the user received the message.
   This means that if a user was on vacation for a week and then came in and
   downloaded his new messages to his MMF, the user's message could get deleted
   right after it is read if the criteria for MMFCLEAN is Read Mail Greater Than
   7 Days. We are currently investigating how to change this limitation.

To install MMFCLEAN.EXE
-----------------------

1. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

   " mkdir <drive>:\mmfclean" (without the quotation marks)

   where <drive> is the local hard disk drive.

2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

   " copy <srcdrive>:\*.dll <destdrive>:\mmfclean" (without the
   quotation marks)

   where <srcdrive> is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
   extracting MMFUTIL.EXE file and <destdrive> is the drive and directory
   where you created the MMFCLEAN directory. For example, if you ran the
   self-extracting file from the TEST directory on drive D, and the MMFCLEAN
   directory is located on drive C, type the following command:

   " copy d:\test\*.dll c:\mmfclean" (without the quotation marks)

3. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

   " copy <srcdrive>:\mmfclean.exe <destdrive>:\mmfclean" (without
   the quotation marks)

   where <srcdrive> is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
   extracting MMFUTIL.EXE file and <destdrive> is the drive and directory
   where you created the MMFCLEAN directory. For example, if you ran the
   self-extracting file from the TEST directory on drive D, and the MMFCLEAN
   directory is located on drive C, type the following command:

   " copy d:\test\mmfclean.exe c:\mmfclean" (without the quotation marks)

4. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

   " copy <srcdrive>:\mmfclean.ini <destdrive>:\<windowsdir>"
   (without the quotation marks)

   where <srcdrive> is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
   extracting MMFUTIL.EXE file, <destdrive> is the drive where your
   Windows directory is located, and <windowsdir> is the path to your
   Windows directory. For example, if you ran the self-extracting file from the
   TEST directory on drive D and the Windows directory is named WINDOWS and is
   located on drive C, type the following command:

   " copy d:\test\mmfclean.ini c:\windows" (without the quotation marks)

5. Set up an MMFCLEAN icon in Windows Program Manager and set the working
   directory to where MMFCLEAN.EXE is located.

MMFCLEAN.INI Settings
---------------------

The MMFCLEAN.INI file must reside in the Windows directory.

You can define the following parameters in the [Options] section of the
MMFCLEAN.INI file. Some modifications to the .INI file are required before you
run it for the first time.

Running MMFCLEAN in Batch Mode
------------------------------

To run the MMFCLEAN utility from an MS-DOS batch file, you need the VMB.386,
WX.EXE, and WXSRVR.EXE utilities located with this utility. Copy VMB.386 to your
Windows SYSTEM subdirectory, and copy WX.EXE and WXSRVR.EXE to your Windows
directory. Additionally, you need to add the VMB.386 file to the [386Enh]
section of your SYSTEM.INI file. For example:

   [386Enh]
   Device=vmb.386

The VMB.386 file will allow you to run a Windows-based application from the
MS-DOS prompt.

WXSRVR.EXE is a Windows-based application that should be run from File Manager or
Program Manager first. WX.EXE is an MS-DOS-based application that is run from
the MS-DOS command prompt under Windows.

Usage: wx [options] program [command-line options]

Options                   | Description
/A                        | Run program asynchronously.
/H[ELP]                   | Call QuickHelp.
/N[OLOGO]                 | Suppress copyright message.
/W                        | Assume virtual machine (VM) is windowed.
/?                        | Display summary help.

Example: wx /w mmfclean.exe /a:20 /n:admin /p:password /u /b
