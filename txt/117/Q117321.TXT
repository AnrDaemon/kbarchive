TITLE   :PRB: CodeView Hangs When Debugging DOS-Extended Application
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for MS-DOS 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using CodeView to run a DOS-extended application that was built using the
Phar Lap 286|DOS-Extender Lite that ships with Visual C++, the program may
appear to run properly, but when control returns to CodeView, it may hang. You
may also receive a message stating system integrity has been violated.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can develop DOS-extended applications using Visual C++ together with the
Phar Lap's 286|DOS-Extender Lite, but these applications cannot be directly
debugged with CodeView. Instead, Phar Lap supplies a full-featured
286|DOS-Extender SDK and it includes a utility that allows CodeView for Windows
to debug DOS-extended applications. There is a README file included with the
286|DOS-Extender Lite that contains more information about the package. For
support and questions concerning both the 286|DOS Extender Lite and the
286|DOS-Extender SDK contact Phar Lap Technical Support at (617) 661-1510.
