TITLE   :PC Adm: .XTN File for Downstream PO Not Updated Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) for versions 3.0 and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks does not correctly update the .XTN file for a
downstream postoffice when the routing definition for the hub postoffice is
modified. This can result in mail being queued for the downstream postoffice but
not delivered.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs on a postoffice that has at least two externally defined
postoffices. The first externally defined postoffice is defined direct via
modem. The second external postoffice is defined indirect via the first
postoffice. When you use the Mail Administrator program to change the routing of
the first postoffice from direct via modem to direct via MS-DOS (or X.25), the
second postoffice definition will not change as expected. Therefore, the second
externally defined postoffice will still show as being defined via modem.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use the Mail Administrator program to modify the
settings for the second postoffice. Simply accepting the defaults displayed
during the modify process will fix the external definition for the problem
postoffice.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0 and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. This problem was corrected in version 3.2a.
