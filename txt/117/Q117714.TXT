The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have AMI 1V version 1.0 BIOS dated 1-18-93 installed and it is not
configured properly, your Windows NT computer reboots constantly.

CAUSE
=====

The ROM BIOS configuration program allows for the configuration of caching above
16 megabytes (MB). With this option off, the computer operates as expected; if
this option is enabled, Windows NT reboots constantly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, make sure the option to configure caching above 16 MB is
not selected.

The third-party product discussed here is manufactured by AMI, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
