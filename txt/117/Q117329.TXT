TITLE   :PC Adm: Running IMPORT.EXE under OS/2 with the -ST Parameter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the IMPORT utility (IMPORT.EXE) with the -ST parameter under OS/2
version 1.3, you receive the following error message:

   An OS/2 program caused a protection violation.


RESOLUTION
==========

Because IMPORT.EXE version 3.2.6 is a bound program, it runs under both MS-DOS
and OS/2.


To work around this problem, run the IMPORT command from MS-DOS.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks. This problem was corrected in version 3.2a.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The -ST parameter extracts addresses for directory synchronization (Dir- Sync)
with a foreign mail system. It can only be used against the Dir-Sync server.
This problem occurs when a group has been defined on the Dir-Sync postoffice. By
default, the GROUP.GLB file is 4 bytes; however, it increases by 51 bytes when a
group is added to the postoffice. If the GROUP.GLB file is 4 bytes in length,
the process works properly.
