TITLE   :FIX: printf Does Not Recognize "\n\r" when Using Conversion
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCRT kbVCkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The C Run-Time (CRT), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 1.0, 1.5 
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an explicit type-conversion syntax is used for the return value of printf(),
printf() does not recognize the escape sequence \n\r in its format string.

The following macro prints "<string x>\n\r":

      #define PRINT(x) void( printf("%s\n\r", x ) )

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the error, use one of the following workarounds:

1. Use ASCII values for the line feed and carriage return. For example:

         #define PRINT(x)  void( printf("%s%c%c",x,10,13 ) )

-or-

2. Use explicit typecasting instead. For example:

         #define PRINT(x)  (void)( printf("%s\n\r",x ) )

-or-

3. Program without the conversion or casting if possible. For example:

         #define PRINT(x)  printf("%s\n\r", x )

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the products listed at the beginning
of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++ 32-bit Edition,
version 2.0.
