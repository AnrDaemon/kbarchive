MORE INFORMATION
================

To use a command-line option, start the program by typing MAIL followed by a
space and the command-line option. You can also add the mailbox name to the
command line.

-<25-50>         Specifies number of lines on screen
                 This option is used to specify the number of lines you
                 want to display on your screen. Minimum = 25,
                 maximum = 50.

-c               Color option
                 This option is used to display the screen in color.

-d<drive>        Specify database location
                 This option -d specifies the drive letter of your
                 postoffice. For example, if drive F is the location of
                 the Mail data files then the command line would be -df.
                 This option is not required for Microsoft-compatible
                 networks using the advanced security feature of Microsoft
                 Mail. It is required for other networks only if the Mail
                 data files are not on drive M.

-e<drive:path>   Specify location of graphics executables
                 This option specifies the drive and path location of
                 graphics executable files.

-h,-?            Show help
                 This option displays the command line options and usage
                 descriptions.

-i<drive:path>   Specify location for temporary graphics files
                 This option specifies the drive and path for the creation
                 of temporary graphic files.

-m               Monitor/Micro option
                 This option tells Mail that the Monitor or Micro program
                 is loaded and will notify you of new mail. The Mail
                 program will not notify you when new mail arrives.

-n<1-999>        Set polling period in seconds
                 This option specifies the polling period between checks
                 for new mail in seconds, from a minimum of 1 to a maximum
                 of 999. Default is 30 seconds. This option is effective
                 only when the -X option is configured to enable polling
                 rather than instant notification.

-n0              Disable polling
                 This option disables polling for new mail.

-p<password>     Specify password
                 This option is used to bypass the password prompt when you
                 start the program.

-s               Specify monitor type
                 This option specifies the graphic display as follows:
                 -SCGA for CGA
                 -SEGA for EGA
                 -SHERC for Hercules Graphics
                 -SVGA for VGA
                 -SMONO for Monochrome monitors.

-v               Reduce screen snow
                 This option is used to reduce the snow on your screen.

-w<1-15>         Set border color
                 This option is used to set the border color. The numbers
                 1 to 15 correspond to the following:

                 Number            Color
                 ------            -----
                    1              Blue
                    2              Green
                    3              Cyan
                    4              Red
                    5              Magenta
                    6              Brown
                    7              White
                    8              Gray
                    9              Bright blue
                   10              Bright green
                   11              Bright cyan
                   12              Bright red
                   13              Bright magenta
                   14              Yellow
                   15              Bright white

-x               Set notification method
                 This option specifies how mail checks for new mail
                 messages: by polling periodically or by notifying you
                 instantly when new mail arrives in the postoffice.
                 The -n sets the polling interval. The effect of the
                 -x option depends on whether NetBIOS is loaded and
                 on what type of network you are using.
