======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The AppWizard, included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 1.5, 1.51, 1.52 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 2.0, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

AppWizard generates code that uses a static UINT array called "buttons" to
associate command IDs to a single toolbar bitmap that contains several images
for buttons 16 pixels wide and 15 pixels high. The IDs are associated with the
toolbar buttons, based on their order in the array.

When you construct a full-server or mini-server OLE application using AppWizard
and you have not selected context-sensitive Help support, the "buttons" array
used by the application's in-place frame window class will contain one less
command ID than the toolbar contains buttons. This behavior is by design. The
image for the Help mode button is included in the toolbar bitmap, even when the
application is generated without context- sensitive Help support.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To view this behavior, perform the following steps:

1. Start AppWizard and choose full-server or mini-server for the application by
   selecting OLE Options from the main AppWizard dialog box.

2. Have AppWizard create the application.

3. Open App Studio, and, if you have a full-server application, open the bitmap
   with the ID "IDR_xxxxxxTYPE_SRVR_IP", where xxxxxx is the first six letters
   of your project. For example, if the project is named "EXAMPLE", the bitmap
   would be "IDR_EXAMPLTYPE_SRVR_IP". If you have a mini-server application, the
   bitmap would have the ID "IDR_SRVR_INPLACE".

4. Open the file IPFRAME.CPP in Visual C++. Find the variable named "buttons".
   Count how many IDs are there besides the ID_SEPARATOR IDs. This would
   normally be equal to the number of button images that appear on the toolbar
   bitmap, but in this situation they are not equal.

5. Now count how many button images are in the bitmap. There will be one more
   image than there are IDs (not including ID_SEPARATOR IDs). In a default
   application created by AppWizard, there will be four IDs and five button
   images.

You need to be aware of this behavior if you decide to add buttons to the toolbar
for the in-place frame window class. If the application does not support
context-sensitive Help or the Help mode button, the button image could simply be
replaced with the new button. If context-sensitive Help will be part of the
application, then you need to make sure the command IDs that you add correspond
to the correct button image. Otherwise, the buttons will not operate the way you
expect them to operate.
