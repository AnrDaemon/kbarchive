SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a graphic from Encarta to a LaserWriter, you may find that a
thin, white line appears horizontally across your printout. This is most likely
to occur when you print a 256-color fractal with the Black & White option
selected.

NOTE: The Black & White or Color/Grayscale options are selected in the
LaserWriter dialog box. This dialog box appears when you click the Printer
button at the bottom of a picture and choose to print the image.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem occurs when printing with the LaserWriter 7.1.2 printer driver. To
eliminate this problem, upgrade to version 8.1.1 or later of the LaserWriter
printer driver.

To obtain the updated printer driver, contact your local Apple dealer or call
Apple at (408) 996-1010.
