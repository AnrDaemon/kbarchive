SUMMARY
=======

If a data file containing MFC CTime objects is moved from MS-DOS (including
Windows) to Windows NT, or vice-versa, differences in the system time under
MS-DOS and Windows NT can cause unexpected results.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Under MS-DOS, Pacific Standard Time is the default time zone. The default time
zone for Windows NT is Greenwich Mean Time. MFC CTime objects use Coordinated
Universal Time (UTC) to store the current time. This can cause problems if CTime
objects are shared between applications on default installations of MS-DOS
(Windows) and Windows NT. Specifically, the time will be 8 hours off.

This is expected behavior for any object that uses UTC. To share data files, make
sure that both systems use the same time zone. If you want to use an absolute
time (one that remains the same regardless of time zone), you must implement
your own object.
