KEYWORDS:win31

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You receive the following error message when you start Windows:

   Ring 0 Systems. Virtual 16550 Driver Board was not found in computer. Virtual
   16550 & communication buffering in the DOS box will not work. It may
   cause lost bytes during the data transfer and other problems with
   communication software running under V86 DOS

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when you:

 - Move your modem to another serial port without reconfiguring the driver.

   -or-

 - Remove the modem from the computer but do not remove the corresponding
   Digicom Systems Incorporated (DSI) device driver (r0dsicom.drv). This device
   driver replaces COMM.DRV as the Windows serial communications driver and
   displays the error message noted above when it doesn't find the modem.

The following modems use DSI-written device drivers:

 - Boca Sound Expression 14.4 VSP

 - Cardinal Technologies MVP144DSP

 - DSI Connection Series

 - PC Logic FAX144DM


WORKAROUND
==========

 - If you move the modem to another serial port, run the DSI.EXE program
   included with the modem to reconfigure the adapter. Contact DSI for more
   information and assistance.

 - If the modem has been removed, the DSI drivers should be replaced with the
   default Windows drivers to remove the error message.

   The DSI setup program makes the following changes in the [boot] section of the
   SYSTEM.INI file:

        COMM.DRV=r0dsicom.drv

   To replace this DSI driver, change this line to read as follows:

        COMM.DRV=COMM.DRV

   The following changes are made to the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file
   by the DSI setup program:

         DEVICE= r0dsivcd.386
         DEVICE= r0dsibuf.386
         DEVICE= r0dsimgr.386


   Remark out or remove the above three lines and add the following to the
   [386Enh] section:

         DEVICE=*VCD
         DEVICE=*combuff

   NOTE: The Connection Series modems require the drivers outlined above for full
   functionality. You should not replace the DSI drivers listed above unless the
   DSI modem is removed from the system. Contact DSI for more information.
