======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to use your Supra Fax Modem V.32bis 144i to run Windows NT or
Windows for Workgroups remote access services (RAS), the modem fails to
initialize.

CAUSE
=====

This happens because the RAS MODEM.INF file contains commands that are not
compatible with the Supra Fax Modem V32bis 144i.

RESOLUTION
==========

To get your modem to work with RAS, use the following procedure:

1. Open the MODEM.INF file in the SYSTEM32\RAS sub-directory in a text editor
   such as Notepad.

2. In the [Supra Fax Modem V32bis] and [Supra Fax Modem V32] sections of the
   MODEM.INF file, make the following changes:

   1. Change "<protocol_on>=\\N3" to "<protocol_on>=\\N".

   2. Change "<compression_on>=%C1" and "<compression_off>=%C0" to
      "<compression_on>=%E" and "<compression_off>=%E1".

   3. If you are using auto-answer mode, change
      "COMMAND_INIT=AT&F2&C1&D2 S7=55 <cr>" to
      "COMMAND_INIT=AT&F2&C1&D0 S7=55 <cr>".

      NOTE: If you are using Windows for Workgroups RAS, after this step, the
      modem may not relenquish control of the telephone line after disconnecting
      the remote server. (This may be a problem when the modem is used on a line
      that is also used for voice.)
