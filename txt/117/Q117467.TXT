SUMMARY
=======

If you try to copy two instances of the same file into a single folder, Windows
95 displays a Confirm File Replace dialog box, which asks you whether you want
to replace the existing file.

It is not possible to have two files with the same name in the same folder. You
can, however, create a shortcut to a file by using the right (secondary) mouse
button to click the file icon and then clicking Create Shortcut. You can then
set the properties differently for the actually file and the shortcut.

NOTE: If you're using the default view setting "Don't display MS-DOS file
extensions for files that are properly registered," it may look as if you
already have two files in one folder; however, the two files actually have
different extensions. (To locate this setting, click Options on the File menu
and click the View tab.)

Additional query words: popup pop-up
