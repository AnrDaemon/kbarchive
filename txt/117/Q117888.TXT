TITLE   :FIX: Relative Include Files May Not be a Dependency
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbide kbVCkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Workbench for Windows, version 1.0, used with:
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Dependendcies to files that are included using a relative reference such as,

     #include "\include\test.h"

will not be generated when a Scan All Dependencies is performed on a project.

RESOLUTION
==========

Adding the project root directory to one of the Include file paths (under
Options.Directories or Options.Project.Compiler.Preprocessor) AND changing the
#include statement to remove the leading backslash (such as in "include\test.h")
will resolve this problem. Additionally, specifying the entire path to the
include file will alleviate this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the products listed above. This
problem was corrected in Visual C++ 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample code will not include test1.h as a project dependency.

Sample Code
-----------

   /* Compile options needed:   none
   */ 

   #include "\include\test1.h"
   #include "test.h"

   void main() {}
