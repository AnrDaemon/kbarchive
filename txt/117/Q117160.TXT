TITLE   :File Manager Shows Wrong File Size for Files Larger than 4G
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

File Manager shows the wrong file size for files that are greater than 4 GB in
size. The file size shown is the difference between the file's actual size and 4
GB. For example, if the actual file size is 4,819,255,296 bytes, File Manager
shows the size as 524,288,000:

     4,819,255,296 (file size)
   - 4,294,967,296 (4 GB)
   ---------------------------
       524,288,000

The DIR command displays file sizes correctly.


CAUSE
=====

File Manager ignores the high DWORD for computing the file size.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.
