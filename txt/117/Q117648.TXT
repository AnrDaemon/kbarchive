PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.0; WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
 - Microsoft Mail Remote for MS-DOS, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Users of versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks may receive an
unexplained mail message from *SPECIAL. For example:

   From:    *SPECIAL
   To:      Username
   Subject: *MAILBAG
   Date:    Thursday, September 23, 1993 10:37AM

   <<File Attachment:  *MAILBAG>>
   *MAILBAG

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when a mail message is sent to a user who is logged into the
same mail account more than once.

For example, if a user leaves the Windows client running on the office computer
then logs into Mail from home using a remote client, the double account results
in the *SPECIAL message. Often these are caused by mail messages created by the
remote client for remote specific tasks such as to include an update header
request or a directory update request. Users do not often see these messages in
their Inboxes because the mail system normally processes the request and deletes
the message.

RESOLUTION
==========

Versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks were not designed to run
in this configuration--with more than one client running at the same time for
the same user on a postoffice. Always log off of mail from one client before
logging on with another client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Files received in this message may include, but are not limited to the
following:

*SPECIAL
RNETWORK.GLB

Additional query words: 3.00 3.00b 3.20 star asterisk
