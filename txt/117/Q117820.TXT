The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Cinemania for the Macintosh 1994 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you press the PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN, or other keys repeatedly, you may
experience a variety of problems in Cinemania. For example, you may be ejected
from the Cinemania Gallery, Help may spontaneously open, the color of your hot
text or windows may change, you may be switched out to the Finder, or your
Macintosh may stop responding (hang).

This problem occurs if you are using QuickKeys.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is due to a conflict between Cinemania 1994 and QuickKeys.
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Cinemania 1994. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, disable QuickKeys before running Cinemania.
