SYMPTOMS
========

Encarta can't display population or climate charts if your printer driver has
not been initialized. If you try to open a chart when the printer driver has not
been initialized, the following message appears:

   Could not complete your request because the selected printing resource could
   not be found. Use "Chooser" to select a printer and try again.

This occurs because MacApp, the portion of Encarta that displays these charts,
cannot launch if the printer has not been initialized.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, follow these steps:

1. From the Apple menu, choose the Chooser.

2. In Chooser, select the printer driver and printer you want to use.

3. Close the Chooser dialog box.

You should now be able to successfully open, display, and print population and
climate charts.
