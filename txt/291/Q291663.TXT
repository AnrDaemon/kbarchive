The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Administrator Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in, an error
message may be reported in the Distribute Software Wizard if you right-click a
particular computer that contains the name "union", click All Tasks, and then
click Distribute Software. Then, in the wizard, when you select the option to
create a new collection that contains the word "union" as part of the computer
name, the automatically generated collection name contains the word "union", as
expected. However, you may receive the following error message:

   Internal Error:
   An internal error occurred during the operation of this Wizard. For debugging
   information, press the More Information button. Please exit the wizard.

When you click More Information, a message box may be displayed that can provide
debugging information about this error.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, instead of accepting the generated name that
contains the word "union" in the Distribute Software Wizard, select a different
name for this collection in the New Collection Name dialog box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
