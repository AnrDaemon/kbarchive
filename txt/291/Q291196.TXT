   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

If a backup domain controller (BDC) is running Windows Internet Name Service
(WINS), the following event error may be logged when you start the BDC:

   Event ID: 3096
   Source: Net Logon
   The Windows NT Domain Controller for this domain could not be located.

Approximately 30 seconds after the startup process is complete, the BDC is once
again accessible.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because WINS is starting too late in the process for name
resolution to occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this problem, edit the registry and create a dependency for WINS in
the Net Logon service:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the DependOnService value under the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\

3. On the Edit menu, click Multi String, type "Wins" (without the quotation
   marks) to add it to the list of dependencies, and then click OK.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

5. Restart the computer.
