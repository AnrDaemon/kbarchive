SUMMARY
=======

A user wishes to send a file to another person, but the file is too large to
send as an e-mail attachment. An alternative is to transmit files via MSN
Messenger, because Messenger does not a place a size limit on transferred files.
However, other limitations exist. Users who are behind firewalls (a Local Area
Network), may not be able to transfer files to anyone outside of their local
network. Also, Messenger file transfers only work if both the user sending the
file and the recipient are online at the same time and both parties are using
MSN Messenger.
