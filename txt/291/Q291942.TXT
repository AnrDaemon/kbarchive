TITLE   :Simultaneous Queries with WMI SNA Provider May Cause "Hang"
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport kbhis2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Applications that use the Host Integration Server WMI (Windows Management
Instrumentation) SNA status provider (Wmisnastatus.dll) to determine the status
of logical units (LUs) may cause the system to stop responding ("hang") if
multiple simultaneous queries are performed. Access violations may also occur
when an application issues multiple WMI queries to check LU status. The specific
access violations may vary but you can capture them by attaching a debugger to
the Windows Management Instrumentation (Winmgmt.exe) service.

CAUSE
=====

The WMI SNA status provider doesn't properly synchronize requests when the
provider accesses the shared memory that stores all the management data when
multiple simultaneous WMI queries are issued.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000.
