MORE INFORMATION
================

CD ROM: Question 70-210.02.02.004 Answer Is A And C
---------------------------------------------------

For question 70-210.02.004, the exam simulation only allows you to select one
response. However, two responses are correct for this question: Administrators
and Power Users. This error only occurs in the simulation; the Readiness Review
text, on pages 56 and 57, correctly reflects the answer.


Page 30: Incorrect Statement About Windows 2000 Service Pack
------------------------------------------------------------

On page 30, change:
"If, after applying the service pack, you add any services or drivers to the
local installation, you must reapply the service pack. To avoid manual service
pack reapplication, type update -s: distribution_folder (where
distribution_folder is the location containing the operating system files) to
slipstream a distribution point. Then use the distribution point rather than the
Windows 2000 Professional installation CD-ROM to add services or drivers to the
local installation."

To:
"In earlier versions of Windows, if you applied a service pack to your computer,
each time you changed the system state by adding or removing components, you had
to reapply any service packs. Windows 2000 automatically recognizes that a
service pack has been applied to the system and which files have been replaced
or updated. Whenever you add or remove components from a computer running
Windows 2000, the system copies the required files from either the Windows 2000
installation files or from the service pack install location, so you don't have
to reapply the service pack."


Page 32: Incorrect Statement About Windows 2000 Service Pack
------------------------------------------------------------

On page 32, in the first paragraph, change:

"If new services or drivers are installed, reapply the service pack."

To:

"If new services or drivers are installed, you don't have to reapply the service
pack, as the system copies the required files from either the Windows 2000
installation files or from the service pack install location automatically."


Page 33: Correct Answer Should Be A, Not D
------------------------------------------

On page 33, the correct answer to question 70-210.01.04.003 should be A, not D.

Please change answers A and D to be the following:

"A. Correct: In earlier versions of Windows, if you applied a service pack to
your computer, each time you changed the system state by adding or removing
components, you had to reapply any service packs. Windows 2000 automatically
recognizes that a service pack has been applied to the system and which files
have been replaced or updated. Whenever you add or remove components from a
computer running Windows 2000, the system copies the required files from either
the Windows 2000 installation files or from the service pack install location,
so you don't have to reapply the service pack."

D. Incorrect: See answer A's explanation"


Page 55: Incomplete Condition In Question 70-210.02.02.002
----------------------------------------------------------

On page 55, in question 70-210.02.02.002, change:

"You share the \Reports folder, assign the Read share permission to user TonyV,
and assign the Change share permission to the Developers group."

To:

"You share the \Reports folder, remove the Everyone group from the share
permission, assign the Read share permission to user TonyV, and assign the
Change share permission to the Developers group."


Page 75: Disk Administrator Should Be Disk Management
-----------------------------------------------------

Page 75, in the second paragraph, change:
"Disk Administrator"

To:
"Disk Management"


Pages 136-137: Disk Defragmenter Cannot Be Scheduled
----------------------------------------------------

Questions 70-210.04.02.003 and 70-210.04.02.004, on pages 136-137, propose using
Scheduled Tasks to schedule the running of Disk Defragmenter. Disk Defragmenter
cannot be scheduled.

On page 137, change answer D of both questions to:

"D. Disk defragmentation does not occur at all."


Pages 139-140: Disk Defragmenter Cannot Be Scheduled
----------------------------------------------------

Questions 70-210.04.02.003 and 70-210.04.02.004, on pages 139-140, propose using
Scheduled Tasks to schedule the running of Disk Defragmenter. Disk Defragmenter
cannot be scheduled.

On pages 139-140, change the explanation for question both questions to:

"Correct Answer: D

A. Incorrect: see explanation for D.
B. Incorrect: see explanation for D.
C. Incorrect: see explanation for D.
D. Correct: Windows 2000 Disk Defragmenter cannot be scheduled."

Page 164: Correction To Question 70-210.04.06.001
-------------------------------------------------

"Using Windows Backup, which backup plan should you choose to both minimize the

needed to restore data?"

displays the wrong IP address.

Change:
"IP Address...: 10.17.1.130"
