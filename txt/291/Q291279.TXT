TITLE   :No Log File Created When There Is No Activity on a Web Site
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If there is no client activity on a Web site during the amount of time that you
specified as the logging period in the Web site properties, IIS does not create
a log file for that time period. For example, if you set logging to occur on a
daily basis, and there are no client requests made to that server during a
24-hour period, no log file is created.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

Additional query words: IIS log logging iis4 iis5
