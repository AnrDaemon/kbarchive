The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++.NET (2002)

SUMMARY
=======

You may have to create debug symbols that can be used when you debug dump files
or perform live debugging by using the Microsoft Debugging Tools. To download
these tools, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/ddk/debugging

Debug symbols are data that let the debugger know about source and line
information, variables used in your application, and data type information for
your program.

This article describes how to create symbol files, specifically .pdb files, when
you build your Visual C++ applications. When you work with Microsoft Product
Support Services, you may be asked to provide these files to help the Support
Professional who is assisting you to determine the cause of a problem that you
are experiencing. For this reason, it may be a good practice to build symbol
files with each specific released version of your application. This article
assumes that the reader is familiar with building applications by using
Microsoft Visual C++.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create symbols for your application in the Visual C++ .NET development
environment:

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the project that you want to modify, and
   then click Properties.

2. In the Configuration Properties window, click the C/C++ folder, and then
   click General.

3. In the Debug Information Format drop-down list, click to select Program
   Database (/Zi).

4. If you want to be able to have information about local variables when you
   debug dump files or perform live debugging, click to select Disabled (/Od) in
   the Optimization drop-down list.

5. In the Linker folder in the Configuration Properties window, make sure that
   the Debug subcategory has the Generate Debug Info property set to Yes
   (/DEBUG).

NOTE: Although it is not mandatory that you also enable Generate Map File in the
same subcategory, this option creates a .map file that may be useful in
determining where a failure occurred when you only have the address at which the
access violation occurred. For more information, see the "References" section.
To create symbols for your application in the Visual C++ 6.0 development
environment:

1. On the Project menu, select Settings.

2. On the C/C++ tab, change Category to General.

3. In the Debug Info drop-down list, select Program Database.

NOTE: If you want to be able to have information about local variables when you
debug dump files or perform live debugging, you should also select Disable
(Debug) from the Optimizations drop-down list.

4. On the Link tab, change Category to Debug.

5. In the Debug Info section, make sure the Debug Info option is selected, and
   then select Both Formats.

NOTE: Although it is not mandatory that you also enable Generate Mapfile in the
General category on the Link tab, this option creates a .map file that may be
useful in determining where a failure occurred when you only have the address at
which the access violation occurred. (See "References" for more information.)
When you compile the symbols for production computers, you should compile in the
Release mode. The steps that are provided in this article apply to compiling the
application in both Debug mode and Release mode. After you have completed the
steps, when you recompile the application you will have .pdb files in either the
\Debug or \Release directory of your project, depending on your build
configuration.
