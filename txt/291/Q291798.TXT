SYMPTOMS
========

When the Termsrv.exe process is running, a performance loss may occur. Note that
this problem may be more noticeable when you start programs.

CAUSE
=====

On a Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition-based computer, the
Termsrv.exe process frequently uses certain registry keys, especially when you
start programs. When the Termsrv.exe process uses these registry keys, a
performance loss may occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition service pack that
contains this fix.
