SYMPTOMS
========

When starting any of the games listed at the beginning of this article in
three-dimensional (3-D) mode, the game may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the Universal Serial Bus (USB) device is using the same
bus as the Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) video card.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use any of the following methods.

Method 1: Run the game in Software Mode
---------------------------------------

Configure the 3-D renderer to use Software Rasterization when you start the
game.

NOTE: If you turned off the 3-D renderer and then began experiencing the problem
described in the "Symptoms" section, remove and reinstall the game.

Method 2: Disable AGP Texturing in the DirectX Diagnostic Tool

   OK.

3. Click the Display tab.

4. Under DirectX Features, next to AGP Texture Acceleration, click Disable.

5. Under AGP Texture, click Disable.

6. When you receive the following warning, click OK:

   devices on your system which support it.

7. Click Exit.

Method 3: Change the Adapter Refresh Rate to Optimal or Adapter Default
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
