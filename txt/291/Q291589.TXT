TITLE   :IIS 4: ErrMsg: "Could Not Start Service. 0006 Handle Is Invalid"
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start any of the NT Option Pack services, such as WWW, File
Transfer Protocol (FTP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), or Network News
Transport Protocol (NNTP), you may receive the following error message:

   Could not start (Service Name: WWW, FTP, SMTP, or NNTP). 0006 Handle is
   Invalid.

A possibly related error may occur when you attempt to use the Internet Service
Manager (ISM). The Microsoft Management Console (MMC) opens, but no IIS services
appear in the display.

If you create a new ISM snap-in and choose the IIS snap-in, you may receive the
following error message:

   The service configuration dll (w3pcfg.dll, wspcfg.dll, sockscfg.dll, etc.)
   failed to load correctly. The specified module could not be found.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when invalid data exists in the actual service dynamic-link
library (.dll) files. For example, you may receive the error if a particular
version of the W3svc.dll file is found on the system and all other pertinent
.dll files are a different version level.

This often occurs when services are added, but service packs are not reapplied.

RESOLUTION
==========

In most cases, simply reapplying the latest NT service pack returns the system
to all the same revision levels. However, note that if any hotfixes have been
added to the system, they need to be reapplied after the service pack is
applied.
