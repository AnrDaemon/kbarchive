PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0,4.0 SP4,4.0 SP5,4.0 SP6
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A program that is running in a terminal server session may stop responding
(hang).

CAUSE
=====

In rare instances, a thread in Win32k.sys may enter an endless loop while
looking for a window. The amount of kernel time for this program will be very
high and continue to increase because the thread is almost always actively
running in the kernel.

==========
