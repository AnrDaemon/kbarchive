SYMPTOMS
========

MSN Explorer users may have difficulty connecting to MSN after installing
America Online (AOL) software. Users who attempt to run AOL software and MSN
Internet Access software on the same computer may experience any of the
following issues:

 - MSN software can't detect a dial tone.

 - Web pages display with errors or not at all.

 - Dial-up connection does not work.

CAUSE
=====

This issue is caused by conflicts between the network components included with
AOL installations and those included with MSN installations.

RESOLUTION
==========

These issues can be resolved by uninstalling and then re-installing the network
components (Dial-up adapter and TCP/IP). Note: Make sure that the customer has a
Windows CD nearby before performing these steps.

 - To uninstall and then re-install the network components for Windows 95, 98,
   and Millenium users

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Network icon.

3. Select Dial-up Adapter, and then click the Remove button.

4. Click OK after the warning box that appears.
   This should remove both Dial-up Adapter and TCP/IP/Dial-up Adapter.
   Note: Remove only Dial-up Adapter; do not remove AOL Dial-up Adapter.

5. Click the Add button.

6. Click Adapter , and then click Add.
   You may have to wait for Windows to build a driver information database.

7. Under the Manufacturer column, select Microsoft; under the Adapter column,
   select Dial-up adapter, and then click OK.
   This will return you to the Network screen. Dial-up adapter and TCP/IP should
   now be present.

8. Click OK.
   Now Windows will build a driver information database. If prompted, insert the
   Windows CD and click OK. Otherwise, after the database has been built, you
   will receive a prompt to restart your computer. Click Yes to restart the
   computer.
