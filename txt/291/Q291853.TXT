SUMMARY
=======

If you print multiple data reports sequentially from a Visual Basic program, you
may notice that pages of the reports are skipped. Because data report printing
is done asynchronously, you must ensure that no asynchronous operations are
pending before you print the next data report.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The AsyncCount property of the DataReport object returns the number of
asynchronous operations still executing. Use the AsyncCount property of
DataReport in conjunction with the DoEvents method to complete any pending
asynchronous operations before you print the next report.

The following code segment demonstrates this:

   Report1.PrintReport
   While Report1.AsyncCount > 0
         DoEvents
   Wend
   Report2.PrintReport
