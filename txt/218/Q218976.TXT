TITLE   :BUG: COPY FILE TO Command Behaves Differently Based on OS
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0b,5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp600bug kbXBase kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The COPY FILE TO command allows you to print to a device name under Windows NT.
In Windows 95 or Windows 98, the command simply makes a file without an
extension with the same name as the device.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. While running Visual FoxPro 3.0x, 5.0x, or 6.0 on a Windows NT 4.0 Server or
   Workstation machine, create a text file named Bob.txt with a few lines of
   text in it.

2. Create a program containing the following code and run it:

   x=GetPrinter()
   ? x
   COPY FILE Bob.txt TO (x)
   SET PRINTER TO
   SET PRINTER TO

3. When the Printer dialog box appears, choose a printer from the Name drop-down
   list and click OK.

4. Run the same code on a Windows 95 or 98 machine with Visual FoxPro 3.0x,
   5.0x, or 6.0.

On the Windows NT machine, the file prints to the printer selected in the Printer
dialog box. It resolves the name as a device.

On Windows 95 or Windows 98, the same commands copy the file Bob.txt to another
file with the name of the printer chosen in the Printer dialog box. This new
file has no extension. In addition, no printed output occurs.
