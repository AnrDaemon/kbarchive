======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95, used with:
    - Microsoft H/PC Explorer, version 1.0 
    - Microsoft Windows CE Services versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows 95 clients that are configured to use statically defined Windows
Internet Name Service (WINS) servers and have the Handheld PC (H/PC) Explorer
software installed, register in WINS as multihomed computers with a second
Internet Protocol (IP) address of 192.168.55.101.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Windows 95 client registers both the network
adapter and the dial-up adapter in WINS when you use statically defined WINS
servers.

Windows CE Services uses TCP/IP and Dial-Up Networking to allow the handheld
computer to synchronize with a desktop computer. A dial-up adapter is added and
is assigned an IP address of 192.168.55.101. Prior to the Winsock 2 upgrade,
WINS settings were defined globally for all adapters configured with TCP/IP.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, install the Winsock 2 update on the computer running
Windows 95 and disable WINS resolution on the dial-up adapter. You can obtain
the Winsock 2 update at the following Microsoft Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/contents/wuadmintools/s_wunetworkingtools/w95sockets2/default.asp

For more information about this update, see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q182108 Availability of Windows Sockets 2.0 for Windows 95

To disable WINS resolution on the dial-up adapter:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   Network.

2. In the list of network components, click "TCP/IP -> Dial-up Adapter", and
   then click Properties.

3. Click the WINS Configuration tab.

4. Click Disable WINS Resolution.

5. Click OK.
