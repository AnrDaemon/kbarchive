TITLE   :FIX: UUID.LIB In VC6 Has Bad Definition for IViewFilter w/OLE DB
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbservicepack kbATL kbDatabase kbOLEDB kbVC600bug kbVS600sp2bug kbVS600sp3fix kbGrpDSVC

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

E_NOINTERFACE is returned when you QueryInterface an OLE DB provider for the
IViewFilter interface and the provider is known to properly support the
IViewFilter interface. This output is received rather than the expected S_OK.

CAUSE
=====

Your OLE DB consumer may have a different GUID value for IViewFilter obtained
when linking with the Uuid.lib file. The library file Uuid.lib installed by
Visual C++ 6.0 contains the GUID {3050F2F1-98B5-11CF-BB82-00AA00BDCE0B} for the
IViewFilter interface. The correct GUID value for IViewFilter when used in
conjunction with Oledb.h is {0C733A9B-2A1C-11CE-ADE5-00AA0044773D}.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information
about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

To verify that you have the correct GUID value for IViewFilter, run the
following sample code from your consumer application:

      OLECHAR wszGUID[1024];
      ::StringFromGUID2( IID_IViewFilter, 
                         wszGUID, 
                         sizeof(wszGUID) / sizeof(OLECHAR) );
      ::MessageBoxW( NULL, wszGUID, L"IViewFilter Guid Value", MB_OK );

If the message box displays the GUID {0C733A9B-2A1C-11CE-ADE5-00AA0044773D}, then
you have a valid GUID for IViewFilter when used with OLE DB.
