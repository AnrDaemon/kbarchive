TITLE   :XADM: PerfMon Counters for Monitoring Exchange DB Sessions

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

It is sometimes possible on a very active Exchange Server computer that the
information store or directory process will surpass the allocated amount of
database sessions configured in the registry. When this happens an event log
message is recorded in the Windows NT Event Viewer application log similar to
the following:

   Event ID: 9037
   Source: MSExchangeIS Private
   Type: Error
   Category: None
   Description: No database session was available to satisfy a request. The
   registry value
   "SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersPrivate\Sessions"
   may be set too low for the level of activity on this server.

and/or

   Event ID: 1164
   Source: MSExchangeIS Private
   Type: Error
   Category: None
   Description: No database session was available to satisfy a request. The
   registry value
   "SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersPrivate\Sessions"
   may be set too low for the level of activity on this server. The current
   value for this parameter is %1.

In accordance with the information in Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q148961,
there is a way by using the registry to increase the amount of Exchange Server
database sessions, however, there is no way to determine the exact or optimal
number of sessions to set this value to.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In an effort to provide a method of monitoring the number of sessions being used
either by the information store or directory service, two new Performance
Monitor counters have been added under the database object. The counters are:

 - "Session % Used"
 - "Sessions In Use"

The counters can be used to to effectively monitor Sessions and alert
administrators when the configured value may be too low.

5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
