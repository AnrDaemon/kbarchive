======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0SP1, 3.0SP2, 3.0SP3, 4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If an APPC or CPIC application attempts to allocate a conversation to the host,
and LU6.2 session level security keys are mismatched between SNA Server and the
host, the following problem may occur:

 - the Windows NT Application Event log may be filled with the following
   errors:

  Event ID: 22
  Source: SNA Server
  Description:
  APPC session activation failure: BIND negotiated parameters unacceptable
     Sense data = 080F6051

  Event ID: 26
  Source: SNA Server
  Description:
  APPC session activation failure: session limit error

   NOTE: The sense code 080F6051 indicates a security violation, as documented
   in the IBM SNA Formats Guide (IBM doc #GA27-3136).

 - The host administrator may encounter numerous LU6.2 security errors on the
   NetView console or error log.

CAUSE
=====

If an APPC application issues an [MC_]ALLOCATE request, causing SNA Server to
establish an LU6.2 session with the host, and if the host rejects the BIND
request because of a session level security error (because of mismatch in
session level security keys), SNA Server returns the wrong APPC error code to
the APPC application:

 primary_rc = AP_ALLOCATION_ERROR (0x0003)
 secondary_rc = AP_ALLOCATION_FAILURE_RETRY  (0x00000005)

instead of indicating a more permanent error condition:

 primary_rc = AP_ALLOCATION_FAILURE (0x0003)
 secondary_rc = AP_ALLOCATION_FAILURE_NO_RETRY  (0x00000004)

When receiving AP_ALLOCATION_FAILURE_RETRY, the APPC program may choose to retry
the allocate request. This would cause SNA Server to retry the BIND request,
causing the host to reject the BIND request.

RESOLUTION
==========
