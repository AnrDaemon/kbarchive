Publishing Phone Books

   After the Connection Point Services(CPS) Phone Book Administrator(PBA) has
   been used to create a phone book containing dial-up entries, the phone book
   may be released and distributed to users from an FTP site. Phone books are
   published by first creating a phone book release, then posting the release to
   an FTP server.

   Only those Points Of Presence (POPs) listed as In Service are included in a
   Phone Book release. Note that the Phone Book Administrator will not publish a
   Phone Book unless changes have been made since the last time the Phone Book
   was published.

Use the following steps to release and post the phone book database and files:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack, point to
   Internet Connection Services for RAS, and then click Phone Book
   Administrator.

2. Select the phone book in the Phone books list.

3. If you have not done so already, specify the Connection Point server address
   to post the phone book files and database by clicking Options, and then
   typing the server address, user name, and password.

4. On the Tools menu, click Publish Phone Book.

5. In the Publish Phone Book dialog box, type the path name of a release
   directory.

6. Click Create. The phone book, .cab, and version files are created and placed
   in the release directory.

7. Click Post.

8. Click Close.

NOTES

 - If you specify a release directory on a remote computer, you may have to
   reset the directory every time you publish a phone book. Every time you
   propagate a phone book by posting, it increments the version number of the
   phone book. If you post to multiple servers, the version numbers will be
   inaccurate. To propagate a phone book to multiple servers, use the Content
   Replication System (CRS) in Microsoft Site Server 2.0.

 - You must enable write permissions on PBData in the FTP site directory. To do
   this, use the following steps:

   1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack, and
      then click Internet Service Manager.

   2. Expand the Default FTP Site and right-click PBData.

   3. Select Properties.

   4. In the FTP Site directory, check the Write permissions box.

 - Make sure that allow only anonymous connections is not selected for the FTP
   directory:

   1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack, and
      then click Internet Service Manager.

   2. Right-click the Default FTP Site. Select Properties.

   3. Click the Security Accounts tab and clear the Allow Only Anonymous
      Connections checkbox, if checked.
