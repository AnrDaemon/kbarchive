TITLE   :Cannot Apply Licenses or Windows NT Upgrade
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server version 4.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you are running a not-for-resale (NFR) or Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN)
version of BackOffice Small Business Server, you cannot apply a Client Add Pack
or Windows NT Upgrade disk. When you start License Manager (Llsmgr.exe) or start
the Licensing tool (Liccpa.cpl) in Control Panel, you receive the following
message:

   Not available in Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server. To add client
   licenses, choose Manage Server from the Start Menu and select About Small
   Business Server.

This message may seem to imply that you can then use the console to add
additional licenses or apply upgrade disks. This is not the case; you are
excluded from increasing the number of users with either method.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you attempt to apply an actual Client Add Pack or Windows NT Upgrade disk,
you receive one of the following messages:

    - This version of the Microsoft Small Business Server cannot have additional
   client licenses added.

    - This version of the Microsoft Small Business Server cannot be upgraded to the
   full version on Windows NT Server.
