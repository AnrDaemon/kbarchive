   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to move mailboxes between two Exchange Server
computers in the same site while preventing users from logging on. This is
useful in situations where you are approaching a disk space limit or a 16-GB
database limit in Exchange Server versions 4.x and 5.x.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To restrict logons to the information store and still allow a move mailbox
operation to complete, follow these steps:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Stop the Information Store Service on the Exchange Server computer.

2. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

3. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

   \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersSystem

4. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and type "Logon Only As" (without the
   quotation marks) in the Value Name text box. Type "REG_MULTI_SZ" (without the
   quotation marks) in the Data Type text box.

5. Click OK. In the Data text box, type the entire Distinguished Name of both
   the System Attendant mailbox and the Directory Service mailbox of both the
   source and target servers on separate lines and then click OK. For example:

   /o=OrgName/ou=Site1/cn=Configuration/cn=Servers/cn=Server1/cn=Microsoft System Attendant
   /o=OrgName/ou=Site1/cn=Configuration/cn=Servers/cn=Server2/cn=Microsoft System Attendant
   /o=OrgName/ou=Site1/cn=Configuration/cn=Servers/cn=Server1/cn=Microsoft DSA
   /o=OrgName/ou=Site1/cn=Configuration/cn=Servers/cn=Server2/cn=Microsoft DSA

   NOTE: To find out the Distinguished Name of the mailbox that you would like to
   add, you may need to start the Exchange Administrator program in raw mode. To
   do so, at a command prompt, type "c:\exchsrvr\bin\admin.exe /R" (without the
   quotation marks), where c: is the drive where the admin.exe file is
   installed.

   In raw mode, select the mailbox that you wish to allow to log on, and on the
   File menu, click Raw Properties. In this case, choose the System Attendant
   mailbox and the Directory Service mailbox. You can see the raw properties of
   these two mailboxes from Mailbox Resources. Next, look for the Object
   attribute that says Obj-Dist-Name; this is the entry that goes into the
   registry as mentioned in step 5. You may need to scroll to get the full path.

6. Click OK.

7. Close the Registry Editor.

8. You will need to restart the Information Store service in order for the
   change to be activated.

   This entry will only allow the mailboxes that have permission to log on, in
   this case, the System Attendant and Directory mailboxes. Leaving the Logon
   Only As value blank will prevent everyone from logging on.

   In order to allow all users to log on again, you must stop the Information
   Store service, then delete the Logon Only As value from the registry, and
   restart the Information Store service.
