TITLE   :The Server Status Tool Does Not Work Without an E-mail Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server version 4.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Server Status tool (also called the Value-Added Provider Reporting
tool, or Vaprpt.exe), tries to send e-mail notification, it may generate the
following error message:

   Small Business Server delivers status reports using e-mail. Please configure
   Outlook or Outlook express to deliver mail.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you do not have an e-mail client installed on your
computer, but you have configured the Server Status tool to send reports by
using e-mail.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, install an e-mail client on the Small Business
Server-based computer. Note that Microsoft recommends you install Microsoft
Exchange Server on the Small Business Server-based computer, but you can use
other e-mail clients such as Microsoft Outlook 2000 or Microsoft Outlook
Express. Also, if you want to use fax-based notification, Outlook should be
installed with the Fax Mail Transport service in the Outlook Profile.

2000 on Small Business Server, click the article number below to view the

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server (SBS) version 4.5 includes a
reporting mechanism called the Server Status tool. The Server Status tool can be
configured to send a report, indicating the health of the server, to a
technology provider. The technology provider is then able to use this data to
assist in proactively diagnosing whether an SBS customer may encounter any
future issues or symptoms. This tool sends the information at intervals you
specify in Task Scheduler. The report consists of a set of logs that are sent to
the technology provider in a raw format for interpretation, and this information
can be sent through e-mail or by fax. At scheduled intervals Task Scheduler
starts Vaprt.exe, which sends e-mail, sends a fax, or executes a command. Note
that any new logs created since the report was last sent are included. For
example, if Microsoft Internet Information Server logging is set to log once a
week and the Server Status tool is configured to send once a day, the IIS log is
only sent once a week. If the administrator enters a phone number in the Send To
box, the e-mail message is sent by fax. For the Server Status tool to be able to
send by fax, Outlook must have the Fax Mail Transport service in the Outlook
profile.
