The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Windows NT Option Pack on a Microsoft Cluster Server 1.0
computer running Windows NT Service Pack 4 (SP4), the following Event IDs may
appear in the System Event log on each node:

   EVENT: 1009
   SOURCE: ClusSvc
   DESCRIPTION: Microsoft Cluster Server could not join an existing cluster and
   could not form a new cluster. Microsoft Cluster Server has terminated.

   EVENT: 1058
   SOURCE: ClusSvc
   DESCRIPTION: The Cluster Resource Monitor could not load the DLL clusres.dll
   for resource type Physical Disk.

The following symptoms may be observed:

 - Unable to fail-over or move resource to other node.

 - Cluster Server service stops responding on startup.

 - An "End-point Mapper" error occurs when starting the Cluster Server
   Administrator.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by the Windows NT Option Pack overwriting some newer SP4
components with older Windows NT Option Pack components.

RESOLUTION
==========

Re-apply Windows NT Service Pack 4 to both nodes and restart the computer.

Note: Service Pack 4 must be applied after the Windows NT Option Pack setup has
completed and after both nodes have been restarted.

Additional query words: IIS4, MSCS 1.0
