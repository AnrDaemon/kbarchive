SUMMARY
=======

Terminal Server administrators may want to prevent their Terminal Server clients
from seeing all the locally created printers in the Printers folder or when
selecting a printer from within an application.
It is possible to assign a specific printer or printers to an individual user or
to groups of users by simply modifying the permissions to the printer or
printers.

To achieve this fuctionality, you will first need to install the updated version
of Localspl.dll on the Terminal Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To assign a printer to a Terminal Server client, follow these steps:

1. Create the printers locally on the server through LPT, LPR, DLC, Local Port,
   and so on. For more information on creating local printers, click Help on the
   menu bar in the Printers folder.

2. Open the Printers folder and right-click the printer you want to assign.

3. Click Properties.

4. Click the Security tab, and then click Permissions.

5. This will display the Printers Permissions Applet where security for the
   printer can be modified

6. Select the "Everyone" name and click Remove. This should leave Administrators
   and PowerUsers with Full Control and Creator Owner with Manage Document
   permissions.

7. Add the user or users you want to allow to see and use this printer and give
   them the Print permission.

8. Perform these steps on each printer you want to assign.
