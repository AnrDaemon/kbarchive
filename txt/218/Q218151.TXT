TITLE   :SBS: Network Installation Is Not Available for SBS 4.5 Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server version 4.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Small Business Server (SBS) 4.5 does not support installing SBS from a command
line using the "/b" switch.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can perform a network installation in Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 or 4.0 by
specifying an unattended Setup script file at a command line to install the
server. For example:

   <x>:\winnt.exe /u:unattend.txt /s:<x>:\i386 /b

SBS 4.5 does not support installing SBS in this manner. SBS 4.5 requires new
installations to be performed using the three Setup floppy disks.

To upgrade to SBS 4.5 from SBS 4.0a, run Setup.exe from the root folder of SBS
4.5 CD-ROM 1. Because Windows NT is already installed, there is no need to
perform an unattended upgrade of SBS using the command line listed above.
