======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) 3.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an argument passed into CComEnumImpl<>::Skip() is a negative number,
then the pointer to the current enumeration may not be set correctly.

CAUSE
=====

Following is the implementation of CComEnumImpl<>::Skip():

   template <class Base, const IID* piid, class T, class Copy>
   STDMETHODIMP CComEnumImpl<Base, piid, T, Copy>::Skip(ULONG celt)
   {
   	m_iter += celt;
   	if (m_iter <= m_end)
   		return S_OK;
   	m_iter = m_end;
   	return S_FALSE;
   }

M_iter points to the current enumeration. If celt is a negative number, Skip() is
supposed to set m_iter back "celt" items. If "m_iter + celt" results in a value
that is less than m_begin, then this case is not handled and m_iter is set to an
invalid pointer.

RESOLUTION
==========

This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.
