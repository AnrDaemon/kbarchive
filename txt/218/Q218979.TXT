TITLE   :PC Win: Cannot Specify Import or Export Date Later Than 2019
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbYear2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you import or export messages based on the date they were received or
modified, you cannot import or export messages that were received or modified
after December 31, 2019. However, if you import or export all messages in a
particular folder, messages that were received or modified after this date are
successfully imported or exported.

CAUSE
=====

When you specify a date range during an import or export operation, you can only
specify a two-digit year. The allowable date range is 1/1/20 to 12/31/19, which
is interpreted as 1/1/1920 to 12/31/2019.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem when you are importing messages, import all the
messages in the folder that contains the messages you want to import, and then
manually delete the messages you did not want to import.

To work around this problem when you are exporting messages, manually copy or
move the messages you want to export to a new folder, and then export all the
messages from that folder.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Mail for Windows
version 3.5.
