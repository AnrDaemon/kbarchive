TITLE   :BUG: SelChange Event in a Grid Executes on a Selected Cell
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbToolkit kbVBp600bug kbOSWinCEsearch kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SelChange Event in the Grid control executes on a highlighted cell. The
expected behavior is that the SelChange Event only executes when a cell in the
grid is selected the first time.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This section shows how to create a sample project that demonstrates the
behavior.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Windows CE HPC project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Select Components from the Project menu and select the Microsoft CE Grid
   Control 6.0.

3. Add a Grid control to Form1.

4. Copy the following code to the Form1 code window:

   Option Explicit

   Private Sub GridCtrl1_SelChange()
      MsgBox "Executed SelChange Event"   
   End Sub

5. Press the F5 key to start the project. Select a particular cell in the grid.
   The message box appears indicating the SelChange Event has executed. Close
   the message box and click the same cell again.

   BUG: The same message box appears indicating the SelChange Event has executed.
   The expected behavior is that the SelChange event would not fire when
   clicking the cell that's already selected.
