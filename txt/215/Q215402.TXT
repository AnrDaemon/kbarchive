======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0, version 1.0

SYMPTOMS
========

If you press F1 to display context sensitive Help topics while focus is set to a
non-intrinsic control (for example, the Microsoft CE PictureBox Control 6.0)
within the Visual Basic design environment, a Help topic does not display.

RESOLUTION

The Help files for these controls exist, but the user has to explicitly browse
for them in the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Help files. To locate the
Help topics for the control select the Help menu, and then click Windows CE
Toolkit Help. Next, select the Index tab and search on the control name (for
example, PictureBox control).

STATUS
======

beginning of this article.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior

   the Project menu (for example, Microsoft CE PictureBox Control 6.0).

3. Draw the control on the default form (Form1).

4. Press F1 to open the context sensitive help for that control.
