New Terminology
---------------

SMS 2.0 introduces a number of new terms, and it slightly changes the meanings of
others. New and changed terminology is documented in the SMS 2.0 Administrator's
Guide, in Chapter 2, "Understanding Changes to SMS Features and Functionality"
and Appendix B, "SMS 1.2 to SMS 2.0 Changes." For a complete list of SMS terms,
see the glossaries in the SMS documentation. SMS 2.0 Help, Network Monitor Help,
and Software Metering Help each include a glossary, as does the SMS 2.0
Administrator's Guide.

The following new terms are not in the glossaries:

Refresh
An administrative command used in software distribution to replace corrupted
package source files on distribution points or to copy package source files to
newly installed distribution points. When a refresh occurs, the current package
source files are recopied or newly copied from the site server to one or more
distribution points.

Update
Used in software distribution to recopy package source files when a file is
changed. When an update occurs, the package source version is incremented and
the package source files are recopied from the site server to all distribution
points currently specified for the package.

The following terminology changes are not in the glossaries:

WBEM and Windows Management Instrumentation
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is the Microsoft implementation of the
Web Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) standard developed by the Desktop
Management Task Force (DMTF) for identifying and manipulating managed objects.
In the SMS 2.0 documentation, certain components that actually use WMI might be
documented as using WBEM (an earlier name for WMI). In these cases, however, the
process flow and functionality are essentially unchanged.

Windows 2000
All references in the documentation to Windows NT version 5.0 refer to the
Windows 2000 family of products, built on Windows NT technology.
