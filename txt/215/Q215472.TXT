SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how the Microsoft X.400 Connector handles high-priority
mail (including delivery and non-delivery reports).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft X.400 Connector will open a new X.400 association with the partner
X.400 message transfer agent (MTA) when a high-priority message, delivery, or
non-delivery report is queued for the partner X.400 MTA. (Delivery and
non-delivery reports do not have priority indicators. Following X.411 spec, they
are treated as high priority.)

The new X.400 association will be used only for high-priority messages (including
delivery and non-delivery reports). Normal or low-priority messages will flow
across the existing association or a new association will be created.

Note that high-priority messages can cause the establishment of a second
association even when the number of queued messages has not reached the
threshold value configured on the Override tab of the Microsoft X.400 Connector
Property page.
