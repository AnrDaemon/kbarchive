TITLE   :SMS: 16-Bit Files Remain After Upgrading to 32-Bit Windows 95/98
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0,2.0 SP1,2.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade a 16-bit Windows 3.x Systems Management Server (SMS) client to
a 32-bit Microsoft operating system (such as Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft
Windows 98, or Microsoft Windows NT), two Advertised Programs icons are
displayed in Control Panel. In addition, the <Windows>\Ms\Sms\Core\Bin
folder contains 16-bit files.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the SMS client installation process detects that the
client is running a 32-bit operating system. Setup installs the 32-bit client
components but does not remove the old 16-bit client components.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, manually remove the 16-bit files. To do this, follow
these steps:

1. On the Start menu, click Shut Down.

2. Click "Restart in MS-DOS mode", and then click OK.

3. Delete the following files:

4. Shut down and then restart the computer.

To remove the 16-bit client files automatically, use an SMS Installer script or
another scripting method. These scripts can be delivered through SMS itself or
by using a logon script.
