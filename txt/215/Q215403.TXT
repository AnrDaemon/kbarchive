TITLE   :BUG: VBCE Design Time HelpContextID Not Persisted at Run Time
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfile kbToolkit kbVBp600 kbOSWinCEsearch kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After setting the HelpContextID property at design time on controls that ship
with the ActiveX Control Pack, the property returns 0 when read at run time.
This behavior occurs when the application is run on the remote device and in the
emulator.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the HelpContextID property is set at run time, it returns the correct value
when it is read.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior only occurs in the Windows CE Platform. The following controls
exhibit this behavior: Grid, ListView, PictureBox, TabStrip, and TreeView.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Windows CE Project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. From the Project menu, choose Components, and then add the Microsoft CE
   PictureBox Control 6.0 to the project.

3. Add a PictureBox control to Form1.

4. In the Properties window, set the HelpContextID property of PictureBox1 to 1.

5. Add the following code behind Form1:

   Private Sub Form_Activate()
       ' Uncommenting the following line of code will allow the
       ' HelpContextID property to return the expected value
       ' PictureBox1.HelpContextID = 1
       MsgBox "Expected = 1" & vbCrLf & "Actual = " & PictureBox1.HelpContextID
   End Sub

6. Press the F5 key to run the program. Note that the expected and actual values
   differ.

After uncommenting the line of code in the preceding sample that sets the
HelpContextID property and running the application again, the expected and
actual values are identical.
