TITLE   :Datdupck.exe Finds Duplicates That Datdupcl.exe Does Not Clean
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Datdupck.exe tool in conjunction with the Datdupcl.exe tool,
Datdupck.exe may list tables that Datdupcl.exe does not attempt to clean.

For example, this is a sample excerpt from the Datdupck.log file:

   3 Duplicate datakeys found in Table: groupxyz_COMM

However, this table is absent from the Datdupcl.log file.

CAUSE
=====

The missing tables are not for groups that belong to the personal computer
architecture. The query used by Datdupck.exe does not consider the architecture
of a group and may list tables for those groups with duplicates that are not in
the personal computer architecture. Datdupcl.exe cleans only the tables for
groups that belong to the personal computer architecture.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
