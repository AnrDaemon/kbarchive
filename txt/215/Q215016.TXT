TITLE   :SMS: Win16 Clients Ignore Detail Level in Software Inventory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When software inventory is taken on a 16-bit Windows client computer in Systems
Management Server version 2.0, a full inventory is always produced regardless of
what Detail Level you select. For example, if you choose the Products Only
setting, a full inventory will still be reported, including Products, Associated
Files, and Unknown Files.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Problem
------------------------------

1. Enable Software Inventory with a detail level set to Products Only.
2. Discover and install a 16-bit Windows client computer.
3. Wait until the software inventory is reported to the Systems Management
   Server site server.
4. View the inventory in the Resource Explorer window.

The software inventory produced will show the level of detail consistent with
selecting all options: Products, Associated Files, and Unknown Files. For
example, the left pane of the Resource Explorer window displays:

   Manufacturer - Microsoft Corporation - Systems Management Server

and the right pane lists all of the Systems Management Server .exe files.

In contrast, the inventory should reflect only the names of the products on the
computer, not the actual files. For example, the left pane of the Resource
Explorer window should still display:

   Manufacturer - Microsoft Corporation - Systems Management Server

but the right pane should be empty.
