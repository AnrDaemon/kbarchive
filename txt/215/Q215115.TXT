TITLE   :SMS: Windows 16-Bit Client Stops Responding with Remote Tools
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms kbsms200 kbHelpDesk

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a 16-bit client computer that is running Microsoft Windows, and you
start the Remote Tools feature on the client from the Systems Management Server
(SMS) Administrator console, the computer stops responding, or "hangs."

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the program information file (PIF) memory requirements
are set to a value that is higher than the client's available conventional
memory. If you start the program that is using the faulty PIF and start Remote
Tools on the client from the SMS Administrator console, the client stops
responding; you must restart the computer.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, ensure that the Memory Requirements section of the
PIF file is not set to a value that is greater than the physical RAM on the
computer.
