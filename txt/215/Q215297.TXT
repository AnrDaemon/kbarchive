MORE INFORMATION
================

The Exchange Server Database engine has detected a potential change (or fix) in
the sort order for various characters in the newly installed version (major or
minor) of Windows NT. To prevent any corruption to secondary indexes, the
Exchange Server Database engine assumes that the sort order has changed and
initiates the rebuilding of the indexes.

Additional query words: sort order corruption JET
