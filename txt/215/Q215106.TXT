======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you uninstall Microsoft Systems Management Server 2.0 remote tool components
from Microsoft Windows 3.1 clients, application errors may be generated when you
quit Windows.

The following error messages occur as application pop-up messages on the client
computer

   "Application Error: WUSER16 caused a Segment Load Failure in module USER.EXE
   at 0001:3C0F"

   "Application Error: WUSER16 caused a Segment Load Failure in module
   IDISP16.DLL at ?"

   "Application Error: PROGMAN caused a General Protection Fault in module
   GDI.EXE at 0004:06A8."

and then Progman.exe is closed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur on computers with low conventional memory (less than 400
kilobytes [KB]), particularly when Wuser.exe remains in memory but all of the
support files have been removed. At this point, if you exit Windows, you receive
the application errors described in the "Symptoms" section.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, increase Windows 3.1 client conventional memory to 400
KB or higher.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
