TITLE   :XADM: Directory Export Sends OBJ-DIST-NAME Instead of Directory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Directory Export sometimes does not use the directory name object attribute as
the directory name when performing a directory export. Instead, Directory Export
may construct the directory name from the OBJ-DIST-NAME object attribute using
the last common name field as the directory. Normally this would be fine, as the
last common name and the directory name are usually the same. But if a customer
deletes and recreates a mailbox changing the case of the directory name, then
the directory name object attribute and the last common name of the
OBJ-DIST-NAME will be different. This can cause problems when performing a
dirsync operation with third-party e-mail servers.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS

version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.
