======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following errors may appear in the Statmgr.log:

   SQL Err #10007> General SQL Server error: Check messages from the SQL
   Server.
   SQL Msg #2627> Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint 'StatusMessages_PK'.
   Cannot insert duplicate key in object 'StatusMessages'.
   SQL Msg #3621> The statement has been terminated.

You may also receive the error on constraint 'StatusMessageAttributes_PK'.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q236325 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
   Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Stop the SMS_STATUS_MANAGER using the Systems Management Server Service
   Manager.

2. Delete the oldest SQL file in the \SMS\Inboxes\statmgr.box\retry directory.

3. Restart the SMS_STATUS_MANAGER using the Systems Management Server Service
   Manager.

4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the Statmgr.log file no longer reports the SQL errors.

NOTE: Performing the workaround above may result in the loss of status messages.
If losing currently queued status messages is acceptable, then you can simply
delete all of the SQL files in step 2 and skip step 4.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server 2.0.
This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack
Service Pack 1.
