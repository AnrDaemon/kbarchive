TITLE   :PRB: InteractiveChange Event of List Box Does Not Execute After
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbContainer kbCtrl kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The InteractiveChange event of a list box does not execute when the mouse button
is clicked on a list box item, held while the mouse pointer is dragged to
another item in the list box, and then released.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using Visual FoxPro 3.0 or Visual FoxPro 5.0, depressing the left-mouse button
with the mouse pointer on a list box item, dragging the mouse pointer to another
item in the list box and then releasing the mouse button causes the
ListBox.InteractiveChange event to execute. However, the InteractiveChange event
does not fire in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a program file called "List.prg" using the following code:

   PUBLIC ox
   ox=CREATEOBJECT('listtest')
   ox.SHOW
   DEFINE CLASS listtest AS FORM
      HEIGHT = 168
      WIDTH = 169
      DOCREATE = .T.
      AUTOCENTER = .T.
      CAPTION = "Form1"
      NAME = "Form1"

      ADD OBJECT list1 AS LISTBOX WITH ;
         HEIGHT = 120, ;
         LEFT = 24, ;
         TOP = 24, ;
         WIDTH = 120, ;
         NAME = "List1"

      PROCEDURE INIT
         FOR i=1 TO 7
            THISFORM.list1.ADDITEM(REPLICATE('0', ;
               4-LEN(ALLTRIM(STR(i))))+ALLTRIM(STR(i)))
         NEXT
      ENDPROC

      PROCEDURE list1.INTERACTIVECHANGE
         =MESSAGEBOX(this.value,64,'InteractiveChange')
      ENDPROC
   ENDDEFINE

2. Click the left-mouse button on list box item "0001."

3. While holding the left-mouse button down, move the mouse pointer to list box
   item "0005."

4. Release the left-mouse button.

5. Note that the code associated with the list1.INTERACTIVECHANGE event is not
   executed.

   Using Visual FoxPro 3.x and Visual FoxPro 5.x, the list1.INTERACTIVECHANGE
   event code is executed.
