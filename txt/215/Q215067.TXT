TITLE   :Online Help Does Not Match Licensed Software Properties
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms120 kbsms120bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Inter-Site License Balancing section in online Help states that the range of
free licenses held at the Software Metering server is from 0 to 100 percent.
This information is incorrect. The valid range is from 1 to 100 percent.

Also, in the same section in online Help, the "Minimum percent of free licenses
held at Software Metering servers" statement should match the License Balancing
tab, which reads "Minimum percent of free licenses held at the Site server."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
