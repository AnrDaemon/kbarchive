TITLE   :SMS: SMS_LOGON_SERVER_MANAGER Fails to Enumerate Shares
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms120 kbsms120bugkbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server 2.0, an enumeration failure may cause the target
server not to be installed as a logon point. It may also cause the
NT_SMS_LOGON_SERVER_MANAGER service to fail and raise an exception. Under some
circumstances, this can also cause the SMS_EXECUTIVE service to raise an
exception and write a crash log.

If you suspect you are experiencing this problem, enable logging on the
NT_LOGON_SERVER_MANAGER service. You will see some of or all of the following
errors:

   Can't determine file system for share [sharename] on server [servername];
   GetVolumeInformation GetLastError 21

   -or-

   NetShareGetInfo 2 on NT server:[servername] share [sharename] return: 2138

   -or-

   NetShareEnum failure Unable to Enumerate NTLM volumes on server [servername],
   error=2138

CAUSE
=====

The enumeration of shares on a logon point may fail if the target server has a
large number of shares. The number of shares required to see this behavior is
not a set number; it depends on the number of shares on the server, the length
of the share names, and the length of the path to the shares.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 2.0. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
