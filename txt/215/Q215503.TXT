SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a new user profile in Turkish Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2
(OSR2) using the User Profiles tool in Control Panel, the computer may reboot
the first time the new user logs on. After this, the new user can log on with no
problem.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if Turkish NetMeeting 2.1 is installed. NetMeeting
writes localized Turkish key names into the default user profile. This can cause
the problems when the user's profile is saved.


RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

NOTE: Using this workaround disables sound notifications for NetMeeting events.

Use Registry Editor to delete the following registry key and its subkeys:

HKEY_USERS\.Default\AppEvents\Schemes\Apps\Conf

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Turkish NetMeeting version 2.1.

Additional query words: restart
