TITLE   :SMS: Remote Control Agent Fails to Upgrade from Beta to RTM
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbHelpDesk

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Systems Management Server Remote Tools Client Agent fails to upgrade from
the beta release candidate 0 (build 1196) version to the released-to-market
(RTM) version (build 1239). The Remote Control Agent might show the following:

 - A version number earlier than 2.00.1239.0000.

 - Version as "Pending" and status as "Repair Pending."

WORKAROUND
==========

Microsoft does not recommended that you upgrade from a beta build to an RTM
build.

For additional information, please see the product release notes and the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q215788 Cannot Upgrade Beta to Market Version

However, you can work around the problem by removing the Remote Control Agent
before upgrading the site to the RTM build.

Steps to Work Around the Problem
--------------------------------

1. Open the SMS Administrator console and expand Site Database, then Site
   Hierarchy. Expand the specific site and then expand Site Settings, where the
   client agents are located.

2. Double-click Remote Tools Client Agent.

3. Clear the Enable remote tools on clients checkbox. Wait for the client
   component installation manager (CCIM) polling interval to expire (the default
   is 1,380 minutes) or restart the client so CCIM removes the Remote Control
   Agent from the client.

After installing the RTM code on the server, you can select the Enable remote
tools on clients checkbox and wait for the CCIM polling interval to expire or
restart the client so that Remote Control Client Agent is reinstalled.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Systems Management Server RTM code has already been installed at the site and
clients in the process of upgrading are experiencing this problem, remove the
Systems Management Server client software from the clients, then reinstall the
RTM software.
