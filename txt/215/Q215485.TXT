TITLE   :Discussion Web in FrontPage May Cause IIS to Stop Responding
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:; winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Internet Information Server (IIS) may stop responding when you use the
discussion Web in the FrontPage Server Extensions.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because of a problem in the discussion Web where the
vti_discussionlinks directive in the Tocproto.htm file is altered. This causes
the Inetinfo process to go into a recursive loop and eventually the IIS computer
stops responding.

==========

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
version 4.0.

This problem has been fixed in the Microsoft FrontPage 2000 Server Extensions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The fix is to properly handle the Tocproto.htm file even when the Tocproto is
missing.
