TITLE   :BUG: AfterLabelEdit Event Fires After Canceling an Edit
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::1.0,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbToolkit kbVBp600bug kbOSWinCEsearch kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual C++ version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using either the Microsoft CE ListView or CE TreeView control in either a
Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic or eMbedded Visual Basic project, the
AfterLabelEdit event fires after canceling a label edit. This behavior is not
consistent with Visual Basic. This event should fire only if the label has
actually been changed in some fashion.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Windows CE project in either Visual Basic or eMbedded Visual
   Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. From the Project menu, choose Components.

3. Select the Microsoft CE TreeView Control to add it to your toolbox.

4. Place a TreeView control on Form1.

5. Paste the following code into Form1:

   Private Sub Form_Load()
      TreeViewCtl1.LineStyle = tvwRootLines

      Dim nodX
      Set nodX = TreeViewCtl1.Nodes.Add(, , "r", "Root")
      Set nodX = TreeViewCtl1.Nodes.Add("r", tvwChild, "child1", "Child")
      TreeViewCtl1.Nodes(2).EnsureVisible
   End Sub

   Private Sub TreeViewCtl1_AfterLabelEdit(Cancel As Integer, NewString As String)
       MsgBox "AfterLabelEdit"
   End Sub

   Private Sub TreeViewCtl1_BeforeLabelEdit(Cancel As Integer)
       MsgBox "BeforeLabelEdit"
   End Sub

6. Run the project.

7. Select the Child node for editing.

Note that the BeforeLabelEdit event fires.

8. Press the ESC key or select the parent node to cancel the edit.

Note that the AfterLabelEdit event fires. This event should fire only if the
label has actually been changed in some fashion.
