======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server Store process (Store.exe) is causing the CPU to
run at, or near 100 percent.

CAUSE
=====

The Store process is unable to get the next Message ID during public folder
replication, therefore, running the same code in a tight loop.

RESOLUTION
==========
