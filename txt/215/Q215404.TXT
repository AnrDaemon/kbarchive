TITLE   :BUG: Graphical Style Property of CheckBox Does Not Work
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbToolkit kbVBp600bug kbOSWinCEsearch kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When setting the Style property of a CheckBox to '1 - Graphical,' the CheckBox
appears to function like a CommandButton. You expect that the CheckBox would
appear similar to a CommandButton, but would appear to stay pressed or
unpressed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Windows CE HPC project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Place a CheckBox on Form1.

3. Set the Style property of the CheckBox to '1 - Graphical.'

4. Run the project targeting either emulation or the default device.

Note that the CheckBox does not toggle, but behaves exactly like a regular
CommandButton.
