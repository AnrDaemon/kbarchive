KEYWORDS:kbToolkit kbVBp500bug kbVBp600bug kbOSWinCEsearch kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 
 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When testing to see if the current form is "Me" always returns False in a
Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic (VBCE) or eMbedded Visual Basic (eVB)
project, the expectation is that this should always return True.

RESOLUTION
==========

The workaround for this is to compare the Caption properties of Me and Form1.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Windows CE project in either Visual Basic or eMbedded Visual
   Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a command button to Form1.

3. Paste the following code into Form1:

   Option Explicit

   Public Sub Test(frm)
       MsgBox "Form1 is frm = " & (Form1 Is frm)
   End Sub

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
       Test Me
       Test Form1
   End Sub

4. Run the project and target either emulation or the remote device.
