PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms120

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When migrating Windows clients from Systems Management Server (SMS) version 1.2
to SMS version 2.0, the clients may get "Cannot reach server Error" error
messages from the Package Command Manager (PCM) and/or the Program Group Control
(PGC) that state the following:

   Program Group Control is unable to connect to any servers. Your computer may
   not be logged on to the network, or you may be logging in to a different
   domain.

   -or-

   Package Command Manager is unable to connect to any servers. Your computer
   may not be logged on to the network, or you may be logging in to a different
   domain.

This error occurs only once during the client migration process and these
messages do not indicate if the user has ever received the warnings and selected
the "Don't display this message again" check box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To disable the message boxes during the migration, add the following lines to
the client computers Sms.ini file under the [Local] section:

   ShowPGCCantreachServersDialog=False
   ShowPCMCantReachServersDialog=False

These changes are only recommended for use during an SMS 1.2 to SMS version 2.0
migration, as they are valuable for troubleshooting client issues.

Additional query words: prodsms pcm pgc cannot find server error interop
