KEYWORDS:kbToolkit kbVBp600bug kbOSWinCEsearch kbOSWinCE100 kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic, version 3.0, on platform(s):
    - Microsoft Windows CE versions 2.0, 2.11 for the Handheld PC 
    - Microsoft Windows CE version 2.11 for the Palm-size PC 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The ItemClick event fires after the first ListItem is added to a ListView, even
though the item was not clicked.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ItemClick event fires only after adding the first item. Adding more items
does not fire the ItemClick event.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Windows CE HPC Project or Windows CE HPC Pro Project in Visual
   Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Select Components from the Project menu and select the Microsoft CE ListView
   Control 6.0.

3. Add a ListBox, CommandButton, and ListView control to Form1.

4. Paste the following code into Form1:

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
      ListViewCtrl1.ListItems.Add , , "Item One"
   End Sub

   Private Sub ListViewCtrl1_ItemClick(ByVal Index As Long)
      List1.AddItem "ItemClick fired."
   End Sub

5. Run the project on the target platform.

6. Click the CommandButton, and note that the first ListItem is added to the
   ListView and the ItemClick event fires.

WorkAround
----------

You can use the following code as a work around for this behavior:

      Option Explicit
      Dim first_time As Boolean
    
      Private Sub Command1_Click()
       If first_time Then
          ListViewCtrl1.ListItems.Add , , ""
          ListViewCtrl1.ListItems.Add , , "Item One"
          ListViewCtrl1.ListItems.Remove (1)
          first_time = False
       Else
          ListViewCtrl1.ListItems.Add , , "Item One"
       End If
      End Sub
    
      Private Sub Form_Load()
       first_time = True
      End Sub
    
      Private Sub ListViewCtrl1_ItemClick(ByVal Index As Long)
       If Not first_time Then
          List1.AddItem "ItemClick fired."
       End If
      End Sub
