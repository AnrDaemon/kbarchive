TITLE   :GetWindowsDirectory May Return Incorrect Data
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:_IK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Out of process COM server applications that attempt to discover the location of
the Windows folder by calling the GetWindowsDirectory() API may fail when run on
Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition.

For example, when the Orgchart application supplied with Microsoft Office is
started as an embedded object, Orgchart fails with the following error message
when it tries to write to the Windows folder:

   Unable to load MS Organization Chart. Press F1 for Help.

This message is followed by:

   The server application, source file, or item can't be found. You should
   reinstall the server application.

CAUSE
=====

On Windows NT Server, Terminal Server Edition, the GetWindowsDirectory() API
should return the user's home folder, not the real Windows folder. The real
Windows folder is write-protected for "ordinary" users. When the server
application (Orgchart.exe in the above example) subsequently attemps to write to
the folder, the write request fails.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal
Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT Server 4.0,
Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 4.
