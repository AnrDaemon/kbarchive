PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbMMC kbRemote kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbHelpDesk kbQuery kbsmsAdmin kbStatSum

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view Status Message Queries for the "Remote Tools Activity Targeted at
a Specific System" selection, a prompt is displayed advising that all existing
values for the prompt will be loaded. After the values are loaded, you may see a
series of numeric files and values displayed in the drop-down list instead of
the expected machine names. For example:

   Inboxes\sitectrl.box\history\00000009.ct0
   1
   1127
   1143
   2000 10 1 23 04 00 00 000
   2000 10 1 09 04 00 00 000

CAUSE
=====

The query being used is designed to return all values for the insertion strings
representing the "Remote Tools Activity Targeted at a Specific System"
selection. As a result, all values returned are listed in the drop-down list.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 2.0.
