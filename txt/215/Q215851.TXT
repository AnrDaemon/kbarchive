TITLE   :XADM: Send Options in PAB Entry is Ignored
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You have a custom recipient for the Microsoft Internet Mail Connector with the
Allow Rich Text in Messages Option selected and on the client side, a Personal
Address Book entry with identical information, but with the Allow Rich Text in
the messages check box cleared.

When you compose a message to that recipient and you explicitly choose the
Personal Address Book entry that has the Allow rich text in the messages check
box cleared, the mail message arrives with rich text overriding the Personal
Address Book options.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Outlook requires Messaging Application Program Interface (MAPI) to
resolve the name against the Global Address Book even though the Personal
Address Book has higher priority. This causes the server-side options to take
precedence over client-side options.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack
