TITLE   :Event ID 12288, 5705 on PDC Because Hard Disk Is Full
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows NT primary domain controller (PDC) may generate the following error
messages in Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 12288
   Source: SAM
   SAM failed to write changes to the database. This is most likely due to a
   memory or disk-space shortage. The SAM database will be restored to an
   earlier state. Recent changes will be lost. Check the disk-space available,
   maximum size setting, and maximum registry size setting.

   Event ID: 5705
   Source: Netlogon
   The change to the cache maintained by the Netlogon service for database
   changes is corrupted. The Netlogon service is resetting the change log.

   Event ID: 26
   Source: Application Popup
   System Process - Out of Virtual Memory: Your system is running low on virtual
   memory. Please close some applications. You can then start the System option
   in the Control Panel and choose the Virtual Memory button to create an
   additional paging file or to increase the size of your current paging file.

The Netlogon.chg file becomes corrupt if the operating system cannot properly
write to the Security Accounts Manager (SAM).

NOTE: Any changes you make to the SAM are lost.

Domain controllers may stop authentication of existing user accounts, and user
accounts created while the problem exists on the PDC may not be functional
because of SAM corruption and Netlogon problems.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the hard disk containing the %SystemRoot% folder is
severely short of drive space. The physical RAM is depleted and the lack of free
hard disk space does not allow Windows NT memory management to page less-used
work out to the hard disk.

Additionally, the Pagefile.sys file is either not large enough or is severely
fragmented. This causes the "out of virtual memory" error message on the server
console. This may also cause users to experience problems when they attempt to
change their password or gain access to the network. In addition, the following
error message may be displayed:

   Registry size limit is set too low for the necessary registry growth.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, free up disk space for the operating system to function
properly.

Free up disk space on the affected drive on which the Pagefile.sys file is
located. To free disk space on the boot partition, you can choose to move the
Pagefile.sys file to another drive.

You can gain additional space by moving files to other drives or deleting
unnecessary files from the Temp folders. Purging the Temporary Internet Files
folder of its contents can also free a considerable amount of space.

After you have sufficient disk space on the PDC:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   System.

2. Click the Performance tab, locate the Virtual Memory section, and view the
   Total paging file size for all disk volumes value. This value should be equal
   to the total amount of physical RAM plus an additional 11 MB (approximately
   11 MB for a standard PDC and approximately 50-100 MB extra for Microsoft
   Exchange Server or other Microsoft BackOffice products).

3. Click Change to view the settings.

4. In the top section of the Virtual Memory dialog box, click the drive letter
   that contains numbers in the Paging File Size (MB) area.

5. In the "Paging File Size for Selected Drive" area, the Initial Size (MB) and
   Maximum Size (MB) values for the drive letter you selected are displayed. Set
   these values to 0.

6. Click on the remaining drive letters in the top section of the dialog box to
   find a drive that has enough space for the page file.

7. Re-create the page file, and set the Initial Size (MB) and Maximum Size (MB)
   values to the levels recommended in step 2 (RAM plus 11 MB for a standard
   PDC, RAM plus 50-100 MB for various BackOffice products). Click Set to lock
   in this setting.

8. Check the registry size at the bottom of the Virtual Memory dialog box. The
   Current Registry Size value is displayed.

9. Set the Maximum Registry Size (MB) value to approximately 15-20 MB larger
   than the value listed for the current registry size.

10. Click OK, to save the settings.

11. Restart the computer.

NOTE: It may be necessary to delete the Netlogon.chg file on the PDC and allow it
to be re-created by the computer at restart.

Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you do not solve the capacity requirements on the hard disk and merely delete
the Netlogon.chg file and allow the operating system to re-create the file, the
Netlogon.chg file becomes corrupt again. The registry size limit needs to be
increased so that the Netlogon.chg file can be properly used by the operating
system.

In some cases, if you run User Manager for Domains while trying to open
Policies/User Rights, the following error message may be displayed:

   The system cannot find the file specified.

This error message indicates that the operating system is attempting to work with
the SAM database and the Netlogon.chg files, both of which may be corrupted and
inaccessible based on the behavior described in this article.

In some instances, when you run User Manager for Domains while trying to create
new users on the affected PDC, the following error message is displayed:

   The following error occurred creating the user <username>. Insufficient
   system resources exist to complete the requested service.

After you click OK to acknowledge this error message, another Event ID 12288 is
generated in the event log.
