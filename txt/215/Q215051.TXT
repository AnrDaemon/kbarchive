The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you remove a Systems Management Server (SMS) primary site, a folder named
SMSPKGd$ is not removed. This share is created when the Primary Site Server is
used as a Distribution Server. The letter x in SMSPKGx$ designates the drive on
which the share is created.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, follow these steps on the SMS Site Server:

1. Start Windows Explorer.

2. Expand drive D.

3. Right-click SMSPKGd$.

4. Click Sharing.

5. Click Not Shared, and then click OK.

6. Select SMSPKGd$.

7. Click Delete.


STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
