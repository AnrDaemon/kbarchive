allows users to run it before it is assigned and the other advertisement does
not, the following behavior occurs:

When the merged advertisement reaches the client, a message pops up that the
Advertised Programs Wizard has a new program to run, but when the Wizard is
opened, no new program is displayed.

When the dialog box for a new program in the Advertised Programs Wizard is
displayed, disregard it.
