TITLE   :FIX: "Operand Expected" Error Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::5.0,5.1,5.1a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 5.0, 5.1, 5.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The expression 'PUSH DWORD PTR OFFSET alabel' causes the Microsoft Macro
Assember (MASM) versions 5.0, 5.1, and 5.1a to generate the error message:

   error A2027: Operand expected

RESOLUTION
==========

The line 'PUSH DWORD PTR (OFFSET alabel)' works correctly. Since OFFSET is a
unary operator, it should not require parentheses.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM versions 5.0, 5.1, and
5.1a. This problem was corrected in MASM version 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is important to note that the operating system that your program is running
on must be capable of supporting 32 bit code segments to be able to run code in
32 bit segments. Most PC based operating systems such as MS-DOS 5.0, Windows
3.0, and OS/2 1.x do not provide support for 32 bit code segments. Newer
operating systems and DOS extender packages may provide this support.
