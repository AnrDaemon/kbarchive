MORE INFORMATION
================

After you create an object, such as a rectangle, a rounded rectangle, or an
oval, you can add a text label. To do this, select the drawing object and then
start typing the text you want. The text appears in the drawing object.

To do this, click AutoShape on the Format menu, click the Text Box tab, and then
click to select the "Word wrap text in AutoShape" check box.
