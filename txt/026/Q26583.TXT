======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 5.0, 5.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Page 91 of the "MS-DOS Macro Assembler User's Guide" shows @DataSize and
@CodeSize typed as @datasize and @codesize. This information is inconsistent
with Mixed.inc, which types them as @Datasize and @CodeSize. This process will
result in an error when interfacing C and MASM using the NOIGNORECASE option.

Both the documentation and Mixed.Inc should show @DataSize and @CodeSize. The
mistyping only will matter when assembling with the -Ml option to preserve case
in names.

Additional query words: 5.00 5.10
