TITLE   :PRB: "AT" Combine Types
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::5.0,5.1,5.1a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 5.0, 5.1, 5.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Macro Assembler will generate a misleading error message when a
segment with the AT combine type is specified with a segment value that is too
large. The error message generated will be:

   error A2029: Division by 0 or overflow

It is not clear from the error message that the segment value was too large.

CAUSE
=====

This is the expected behavior of MASM 5.0, 5.1, and 5.1a.

RESOLUTION
==========

MASM 6.0 now generates the following error message:

   error A2084: constant value too large

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample code can be used to demonstrate the problem.

Sample Code
-----------

   ; Assemble options needed: none

   S1  SEGMENT AT  01234H   ; This segment is OK
   S2  ENDS

   S2  SEGMENT AT  12345H   ; This segment generates a misleading error
   S2  ENDS

   END
