SUMMARY
=======

When you try to enter the code for displaying characters belonging to the
extended ANSI or IBM PC character sets, your computer may beep and then fail to
display the character(s).

This is because when you enter an ANSI or PC character code, you must use the
numeric keypad on your keyboard. If you use the number keys at the top of the
keyboard, your computer produces a beeping sound and does not work properly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To enter an ANSI code, hold down the ALT key, and, using the numeric keypad,
enter the digit 0, followed by the two- or three-digit code of the desired
character.

To enter an IBM PC character, hold down the ALT key, and using the numeric
keypad, enter the appropriate three-digit code. The NUM LOCK key can be on or
off when entering the code.
