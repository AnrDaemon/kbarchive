TITLE   :FIX: Relational Operators with MOV May Evaluate Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::5.0,5.1,5.1a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 5.0, 5.1, 5.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) versions 5.0, 5.1, and 5.1a, some of the
relational operators evaluate to the wrong value when used with a MOV
instruction.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM versions 5.0, 5.1, and
5.1a. This problem was corrected in MASM version 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following listing-file sections are examples of this problem. It is
important to note that FFFF=true, and 0000=false. It is also important to note
that when FFFFh is used with the GT, GE, LE, and LT operators, it is interpreted
as the largest positive number, not as -1.
