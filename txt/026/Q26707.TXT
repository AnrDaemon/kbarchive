SUMMARY
=======

You can use a cast override to change the operand size for the LOOP instruction.
For example, use "LOOP dword ptr alabel", so that in a 16-bit segment, ECX will
be used instead of CX. If you use a WORD override in a 32-bit segment, CX will
be used instead of ECX.

Additional query words: 5.00 5.10
