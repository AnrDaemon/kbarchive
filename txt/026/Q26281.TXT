The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Microsoft MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later, redirection has higher priority
than the REM command. For example, the following batch file causes the file
test to contain either "BBBBB" or zero bytes after the REM statement,
depending on which version of MS-DOS your are using. In other words, the
redirection symbol is not disabled by the REM statement.

      echo AAAAA > test
      type test
      REM echo BBBBB test > test
      type test

Even if you comment out the redirection with a REM statement, it still
occurs, nullifying the file (because the REM command ensures that nothing
would be redirected into the file).

Additional query words: 6.22 3.2 3.21, 4.x 5.x 6.00 6.20
