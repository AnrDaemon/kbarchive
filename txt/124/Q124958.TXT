TITLE   :NTFS Integrity Problems with Large Stripe Sets
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a large hard disk drive (for example, a Seagate 9 GB) for a stripe
set with or without parity on NTFS, you may experience file corruption and data
integrity problems.

CAUSE
=====

The fault tolerance (FT) driver stripe code calculates the row for I/O using
64-bit math. However, when building the IRP for the I/O it calculates the byte
offset from the "row" value using 32-bit math.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Windows NT Server version 3.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest
U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.5. For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
