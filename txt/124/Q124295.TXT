======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT on an IBM PS/2 model 56 8556, the system may stop
responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when your computer is using older IBM PS/2 system software.
The IBM PS/2 model 56 8556 shipped with system software that used $BOOT.IML and
$0000000.IML. These files reside in the system partition (IBM's equivalent to a
flash BIOS). The file dates are 12/10/91 and 12/7/91, respectively.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, upgrade to the latest system software, or use files
dated 6/10/93 or later. For additional information, contact IBM Technical
Support at (800) 772-2227.

The PS/2 computer discussed here is manufactured by IBM Corporation, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this product's performance or reliability.
