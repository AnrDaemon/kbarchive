TITLE   :BUG: SQLColumns Returning NULLABLE May Not Be Accurate
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbBug kbISS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG# QJET: 1845 (2.00.2317)

SYMPTOMS
========

The behavior discussed in this article pertains to the Microsoft Access driver
only. SQLColumns returns NULLABLE=1 for a column that is actually not nullable
(for example, the Required property was set to Yes for this column using
Microsoft Access).

Use Microsoft Access to create a table called test that has a column called col1
of type text(10). For this column, set the Required property to Yes. As a
result, this column does not allow nulls. However, SQLColumns returns NULLABLE=1
for col1, indicating that the column does allow nulls, which is not correct.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in ODBC Access Driver version
2.00.2317. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
