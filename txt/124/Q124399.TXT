TITLE   :Beyond Mail Clients Unable to Log On to NetWare Post Office
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a Windows NT version 3.5 with Client or Gateway Services installed, when a
user tries to run Banyan Systems' Beyond Mail client software and log on to a
Beyond Mail post office that resides on a Novell NetWare server, the logon
fails. Accessing files or printers on the NetWare server works fine.

CAUSE
=====

The SetLockMode API is not handled correctly by the Client Services for NetWare,
resulting in the Beyond Mail client being unable to lock open the user's
mailbox. Because the file cannot be locked in exclusive mode, the logon attempt
fails.

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid this problem, use a Beyond Mail post office on another supported
network server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT version 3.51.
