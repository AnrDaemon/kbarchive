TITLE   :MHS: Incoming Messages Lose 79th Character
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Incoming messages that contain a line longer than 79 characters are wrapped
after the 78th column, and the 79th character is deleted.

CAUSE
=====

When OUTPOST.EXE parses a message, it looks for the carriage return- linefeed
(CR/LF) combination to indicate the end of the line. The 79th character is not
being preserved during this check.
