SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the hardware required to run Windows NT 3.5 on ASUSTECH
(ASUS) dual Pentium computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This configuration, in accordance with the Intel SMP 1.0 specification, requires
that the second Pentium chip be designed to be used as a second processor. You
cannot use two primary Pentium chips. If you purchased the computer with only
one Pentium chip and you plan to obtain a second processor, check with the
manufacturer for availability. If you have the two Pentium chips properly
installed, the BIOS reports "Number of processors 2" when you start the
computer.

This configuration also requires an Award BIOS revision level 0303 or later.
Check the CMOS setup to determine your version.
