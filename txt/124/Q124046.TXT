======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform a WordPerfect 6.0a or 6.1 network workstation setup, you are
presented with a dialog box prompting you to enter the Network Login ID.
Entering the Network Login password allows setup to be completed. Each
subsequent attempt to start WordPerfect results in the same behavior. The
Network Login password must be entered each time you start WordPerfect, even
though you are already logged on to the network.

CAUSE
=====

WordPerfect 6.0a or 6.1 cannot determine the "USER ID" using the standard
Windows application programming interface (API).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior you must add a setting to a WordPerfect ENV file. For
information on the steps to perform, please contact WordPerfect product
support.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
