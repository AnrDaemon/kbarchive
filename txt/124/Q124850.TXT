SUMMARY
=======

If you use the Secret Agent tool to create a password for a document, pictures
and text are not intelligible when you open the document later. To see the
document correctly, you must supply the correct password. If you forget the
password, Creative Writer provides a way to decode the document.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To decode a document for which you have forgotten the password, follow these
steps:

1. Open the document.

2. Choose Secret Agent.

3. Type "Detective McZee to the rescue" (without the quotation marks).

4. Press down and hold CTRL+SHIFT and click OK (Windows) or press down and hold
   COMMAND+SHIFT and click OK(Macintosh).
