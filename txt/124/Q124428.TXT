TITLE   :NE2000 and Panasonic CD-ROM Fails when Used Simultaneously
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You experience a failure loading and simultaneously using a NE2000 (or
compatible) network adapter and a Panasonic CD-ROM drive attached to a Sound
Blaster 16 adapter.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the NE2000 (or compatible) network adapter is
configured to use an I/O port address greater than 300H.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, do one or both of the following:

 - Configure the I/O port address of the NE2000 (or compatible) network adapter
   to less than 300H. The NE2000 driver shipped with Windows NT version 3.5 only
   supports the I/O port address of 280H under 300H. To change the address
   setting, do the following:

   1. Run Control Panel and choose Network.

   2. Select the NE2000 driver under Installed Adapter Cards and choose
      Configure.

   3. Change the I/O Address to 280H and choose OK.

   4. Shutdown Windows NT.

   5. Either run the Configuration Utility or change jumpers on the NE2000 (or
      compatible) network adapter, configuring it to use the I/0 Port address of
      280H.

   6. Restart Windows NT.


 - If the I/O port address of 280H does not work, change it to a another one
   either by using the Configuration Utility or changing the jumpers on the
   network adapter. In Windows NT, you must modify the Registry to change to an
   address other than 280H.

   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
   problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
   Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
   Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

   1. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

   2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

   SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NE2000x\Parameters

      (where x is the number of the NE2000 network adapter)

   3. Select the IoBaseAddress value.

   4. From the Edit menu, choose DWORD.

   5. In the Data field, type the hexadecimal address configured for the network
      adapter. For Radix, select Hex.

   6. Close Registry Editor.

   7. Shutdown and restart Windows NT.

following supported settings for the NE2000 (or compatible) network interface
