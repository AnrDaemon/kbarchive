SUMMARY
=======

The Windows Command Line allows Windows programs to make calls from macros to
SourceSafe. All output, however, will be generated in Windows' output windows,
instead of MS-DOS sessions.

SSWCL.EXE is the Windows Command Line executable. Use it as you use SS.EXE on the
other SourceSafe platforms. For example:

   SSWCL create $/myproject

NOTE: It cannot be executed from a MS-DOS session.

Refer to the Microsoft Command Line Reference more information on SourceSafe
command and command line syntax.
