======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT from a compact disc using WINNT.EXE (with or without
the /B switch), the following message appears during the search for mass storage
devices:

   Setup has recognized the following mass storage devices in your computer:
   <none>.

If you are running WINNT without any parameters, and you choose Continue, Setup
continues and then asks for disk number four. Because disk number four does not
exist, Setup cannot continue.

If you are running WINNT /B, and you choose Continue, Setup completes. When you
try to install the Future Domain 800-series device driver the following error
message appears:

   Error: Unable to open the file D:\i386\fd8xx.sys.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the J3 jumpers on your STB Powergraph video accelerator
card is in the 16-bit BIOS position.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set the J3 jumper to the 8-bit BIOS position. If you were running WINNT without
any parameters to install Windows NT, you should now be able to reinstall it.

For more information, contact STB Systems Inc. at (800) 234-4334.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The J3 jumper is used to configure the card for 8-bit or 16-bit BIOS data
transfers. The 16-bit BIOS setting is designed for real-mode (MS-DOS) software.
The 8-bit BIOS setting is designed for non-real mode software.
