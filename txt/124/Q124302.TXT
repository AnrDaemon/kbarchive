BUG# QJET: 1845 (2.00.2316)

SYMPTOMS
========

Setting up a Microsoft Access data source to point to an .MDB file on the
network that is already being accessed by another application causes a sharing
violation. The sharing violation does not occur if the application using the
.MDB file is on the same machine as the .MDB file and the data source setup is
also being run on the same machine.

For the purposes of this description, WS1 and WS2 are two workstations and FS is
a file server. Suppose an .MDB file is on FS, and WS1 has a data source setup to
point to this .MDB file. App1 running on WS1 is connected to the .MDB file and
is using it in non-exclusive mode. Now, a user on WS2 tried to setup a data
source and points the data source to the .MDB file on FS. When the user clicks
OK on the ODBC Microsoft Access 2.0 Setup dialog box, the following error
occurs,

   Sharing Violation on Driver <x>

where <x> is the driver letter on WS2 connected to FS.

The problem also occurs when WS1 and FS are the same machine. For example, App1
is accessing a local .MDB file, and WS2 is trying to set up a data source to
point to it.

The problem does not occur if the data source setup is being run on the same
machine that App1 is being run on. That is, if App1 and the setup are running on
WS1, then no problems occur, regardless of whether the data source is local or
on the network.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in ODBC Access Driver versions
2.00.2316 and 2.00.2318. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
