TITLE   :Application Error: SUWIN Caused an Illegal Instruction
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:msnets win95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use Netsetup.exe to perform a server-based setup of Windows 95
on a system running Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS, you receive the
following error:

   Application Error "SUWIN caused an illegal instruction in module GDI.EXE at
   0001:16EF."

NOTE: This error can also occur on systems with insufficient hard disk space to
create a temporary setup directory.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs on Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS systems configured to use the
basic network redirector. When Windows 95 is set up from an MS-DOS prompt, it
loads a mini-version of Windows. This version is very sensitive to system files
not being accessible or loadable. The basic redirector included with Workgroup
Add-On for MS-DOS may occasionally drop file handles and/or network connections.
After this occurs, the mini-version of Windows fails to load code segments or
resources and generates the error message.

RESOLUTION
==========

Run Setup after starting Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS using the full redirector.
To start Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS with the full redirector, type "net stop"
(without the quotation marks) at an MS-DOS prompt and log off the system. Then
type "net start full" (without the quotation marks) and log on to the system.
Setup should now run without generating the error message.
