SUMMARY
=======

Dialing Properties is designed to automatically add a "1" before a telephone
number that has an area code different from your own. You do not need to add the
"1" manually.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Dialing Properties, you use the entries in the "How I dial from this
location" (When Dialing From Here in Windows 98) box to specify a number for
reaching an outside telephone line. For example, if your company requires that
you dial a "9" to reach an outside telephone line, type "9" (without quotation
marks) in both "To access outside line, first dial..." boxes. Do not type a "1"
in either of these boxes. If you do not need to dial a number to reach an
outside telephone line, leave these boxes empty.
