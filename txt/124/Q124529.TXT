SUMMARY
-------

The Shadow setting allows you to set up a central directory location where
users can compile access code without entering SourceSafe.

NOTE: Any modifications made to the files in this directory will not be
reflected in the SourceSafe database.

To set a shadow directory for the project $/test, in the SRCSAFE.INI or
SS.INI:

           [$/test]
           Shadow = f:\test

If the project header [$/test] already exists, do not create a new one,
just add the Shadow setting underneath the other settings. For example:

           [$/test]
           Dir = c:\test
           Shadow = f:\test

When files are updated to the $/test project, modifications will be
reflected in f:\test as well.
