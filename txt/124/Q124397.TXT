TITLE   :HP 4V, 4MV, & Epson Stylus Drivers Don't Install Off Floppy Disk
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you download the printer drivers for Hewlett-Packard (HP) 4V and 4MV
LaserJet and Epson Stylus Color printers from the Microsoft Windows NT Driver
Library (WNTDL), the drivers do not install properly from a floppy disk drive.

If you copy the Epson Color Stylus printer driver, ESCP2MS.EXE, to a 3.5- inch
disk and then attempt to install the driver on Windows NT Workstation, a prompt
appears asking you to insert disk 16 for NT Workstation.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, copy the files to a directory on the hard disk
drive. When the dialog box appears asking you to insert the disk in drive A,
instead, enter the path where the files are stored on the hard disk. The printer
driver installs properly.

STATUS
======
