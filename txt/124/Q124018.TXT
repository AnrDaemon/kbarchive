PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbmm kbsetup kbprb

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Complete NBA Basketball for Windows, 1994-1995, 1995-1996 editions 
 - Microsoft Encarta 96 Encyclopedia for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Setup for the program listed at the top of this article may appear to stop
responding (hang) while Setup searches for installed components.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the resolution section for your multimedia program/

Basketball
----------

Pressing CTRL+ESC on the keyboard brings up the Task List, which will show two
Microsoft Complete Basketball Setup entries. One of these entries may be a
window that lost focus during setup. Switch to this entry and choose OK to close
the window. Setup should now continue.

Encarta 96 Encyclopedia
-----------------------

This problem may be caused by CPU utilization required to control the CD ROM
drive. Testing with MSInfo may indicate that the CD ROM does not meet MPC
minimum requirement (Transfer rate of 300KB/second with less than 40% CPU
utilization).

MORE INFORMATION
================

If there are no sound drivers installed on the system, Setup opens a dialog box
that tells you this. If you click outside of this dialog box (or minimize it),
it loses focus. The Setup window will then say searching for installed
components, and will not continue to the next dialog box until the "no sound
card" dialog box is found and the OK button is chosen.
