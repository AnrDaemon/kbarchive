TITLE   :Installing HP 4V/MV Driver May Disable HP Printing in NT 3.1
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.10
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Windows NT printer drivers for the Hewlett-Packard (HP) printer models
4V and 4MV are for Windows NT version 3.5 only. If you install these
drivers in Windows NT version 3.1, all printing to any HP printer which is
installed and uses PCL5 will be disabled.

NOTE: Any clients using Connect to Printer to a Windows NT version 3.1
Print Server with the HP 4V/MV driver installed will also be affected. The
driver will be copied to that computer as well, affecting any HP PCL5
printers installed locally.

To restore printing to HP printers in Windows NT version 3.1 after the
4V/MV driver is installed, use Windows NT EXPAND.EXE to expand the
following files from the Windows NT version 3.1 installation media to the
%SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\SPOOL\DRIVERS\W32X86 directory.

   HPPCL5MS.DLL
   RASDD.DLL
   RASDDUI.DLL

Then remove any printers that were using the HP 4V/MV driver. This driver
will not work in Windows NT version 3.1.
