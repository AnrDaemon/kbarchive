The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

NDIS 2.0 drivers are still used by some network vendors with Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11. While the configuration for using these drivers with
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 is different than with Windows for Workgroups 3.1
due to the migration to the NDIS 3.0 standard in Windows for Workgroups 3.11, it
is possible to use NDIS 2.0 drivers with Windows for Workgroups 3.11.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can install the real-mode NDIS 2.0 drivers automatically using the Network
Setup icon, or you can install the drivers manually.

To install a driver automatically, the network vendor must provide a disk with
the driver and an OEMSETUP.INF file for the driver. For information about
creating OEMSETUP.INF files, please see the "Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
Resource Kit."

To add an NDIS 2.0 driver manually, modify the [Network Drivers] section of the
SYSTEM.INI file to contain the following entries:

      transport=<NDIS 2.0 driver filename>
      LoadRMDrivers=YES
