TITLE   :ATI Graphics Pro Turbo Video DAC Incorrectly Detected
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade or install Windows NT version 3.5 on a computer with an ATI
Graphics Pro Turbo PCI video card, Windows NT Setup detects the video card as an
ATI Graphics Compatible Adapter. Only 16 and 256 colors are supported for any
resolution.

If you manually configure the video card to use the ATI Graphics Pro Turbo video
adapter driver, only 16 and 256 colors are available and the Test option of
Display in Control Panel fails.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) is incorrectly
identified as a Brooktree BT-47x DAC instead of an ATI 68860 DAC.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the ATI Graphics Pro Turbo PCI video adapter is detected as using a Brooktree
BT-47x DAC, call the ATI bulletin board system (BBS) at (905) 764-9404 and
download 64NT35.ZIP. Extract the contents of 64NT35.ZIP and follow the
installation instructions. For more information, contact ATI Technical Support
at (905) 882-2600.

To verify the DAC type:

1. Run Control Panel and choose Display.

2. Choose the Change Display Type button.

3. Verify that the Adapter Type is the ATI Graphics Pro Turbo.

4. Verify that the DAC type in Adapter Information is ATI 68860.
