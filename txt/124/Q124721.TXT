SUMMARY
=======

Typing HELP <topic> in the Command window does not bring up the Help topic
on the specified command or function if that command or function is one of the
new dBASE supported commands. Approximately 50 new commands and functions for
dBASE compatibility were added to FoxPro since version 2.5. Most of them do not
have Help topics.

This documentation error has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.

To locate the Help topic for these new commands, type HELP in the Command window.
Then select "What's New Since FoxPro 2.5." Scroll through the help topics to
locate the "New FoxPro Commands and Functions" topic. Syntax and details about
the new commands and functions are documented there.

Here are the new commands and functions not found with HELP in FoxPro for MS-DOS
versions 2.6 and 2.6a:

   @...SCROLL
   ASSIST
   BARCOUNT()
   BARPROMPT()
   FDATE()
   FLDCOUNT()
