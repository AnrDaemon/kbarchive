-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use Disk Administrator to change the drive letter of your system or
boot partition, important references to the drive (such as drive paths, system
environment variables and system-controlled references for the system or boot
partition) are reset. You need to reset the following user- controlled
references manually (either before or after changing the drive letter):

 - Paging File drive designation

 - User environment variables

 - User set program items

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you do not move the paging file before you change the drive letter of the
partition that the paging file resides on, the following error message appears
when you restart the system:

   Limited Virtual Memory Your system is running without a properly sized paging
   file. Please use the virtual memory option of the System applet in the
   Control Panel to create a paging file, or to increase the initial size of
   your paging file.

To correct this situation, re-create the paging file under the new drive letter
designation.

You do not receive any errors or experience problems running applications that
access the user environment variables until you attempt to access those
resources. You can change the user environment variables by running Control
Panel and choosing System. Each program item affected by the drive letter change
must be modified individually.
