SUMMARY
=======

When you compose a message on a Bulletin Board Service (BBS) and type a subject
in the Subject area, the subject you typed also appears in the message's title
bar.

If you use a tab character in the message subject, the tab character appears as
spaces in the Subject area and as a pipe character (|) in the message's title
bar. For example, the subject

   "<tab character>This is the subject"

appears in the Subject area as

   "     This is the subject"

and in the title bar as:

   "|This is the subject"
