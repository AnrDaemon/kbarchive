======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright will not run on the Windows NT platform.

CAUSE
=====

One of the minimum requirements listed on the box is "Microsoft Windows version
3.1 or later." Windows NT is a substantially different from Windows 3.1, and,
therefore, Frank Lloyd Wright does not run on it. Frank Lloyd Wright Setup may
run successfully, but the application will not start. This is a limitation of
Frank Lloyd Wright and not of Windows NT.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright
version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
