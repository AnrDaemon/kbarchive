Explorapedia. If you are experiencing a specific problem, please look at the
following article in the Microsoft KnowledgeBase for more information:

   Q129453 "Explorapedia: Error Messages When Running Explorapedia"

If Sounds Are Not Played At All
-------------------------------

 - Check the volume on the sound card, speakers, and sound card software.

 - Verify that system sounds are enabled.

 - Play a .WAV file from Sound Recorder to see if Windows sounds are working
   correctly.

 - Verify that the PC Speaker driver software is not installed. If so, disable
   it. Explorapedia is not designed to run with PC Speaker software.

 - Verify that the sound card software is installed correctly.

 - Check the card to see that it is seated firmly and correctly and that the
   speakers are plugged in correctly. Check the card jumpers.

If Sounds Are Played, but They Are Distorted or Fuzzy
-----------------------------------------------------

 - Verify that the volume is not set too high. If the volume is too high, sound
   will be distorted or fuzzy.

 - Check the DMA settings for your sound card.

If Sounds Are Played, but They Skip or Are Cut Off
--------------------------------------------------

 - This may be an indication that your CD-ROM drive is not fully MPC (Multimedia
   PC) compliant (sustained transfer rate of 300K/second while consuming no more
   than 40-percent of the CPU bandwidth), or it may indicate that you are using
   a SINGLE speed CD-ROM. If you are using a single speed CD-ROM, you may
   experience drop-out during videos or animation.

 - Only one sound can be played at a time; therefore, other applications that
   produce sound can interrupt Explorapedia's sounds. Do not run other programs
   while you are running Explorapedia.

If Narration and Tad's Voice Play, But Not the Music
----------------------------------------------------

 - Verify that the only sound drivers installed are the ones for your current
   sound card. For more information about how to perform this task in Windows,
   see your Windows printed documentation or online Help.

 - Remove any old or incorrect sound drivers from the drivers list. (This would
   include PC Speaker drivers or sound drivers for a sound card that you have
   replaced.)
