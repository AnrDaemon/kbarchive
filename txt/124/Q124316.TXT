BUG# QJET: 11 (2.00.2317)

SYMPTOMS
========

When you execute a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE queries with a vertical bar
(|) contained in a character string, you receive an error that there is a syntax
error in string in query expression.

For example, consider table test created like:

   CREATE TABLE test (t text(20))

Then executing any of the following,

   INSERT INTO test VALUES('|')

   DELETE FROM test WHERE t='|'

   UPDATE test SET t='|'

will return an error, with

   SQLSTATE=S1010 and szErrorMsg="[Microsoft][ODBC Access 2.0 Driver]Syntax
   error in string in query expression"

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in ODBC Access Driver version
2.00.2317. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
