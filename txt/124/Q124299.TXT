TITLE   :SFM Does Not Detect Xircom PCMCIA Ethernet Adapter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Services for Macintosh (SFM) under Windows NT Server version
3.5, and you are using a Xircom CE10 PCMCIA Ethernet adapter, the following
error message appears:

   Setup cannot find any network adapter for Services for Macintosh. You will be
   unable to use Services for Macintosh. Try adding a network adapter or enable
   the bindings for AppleTalk protocol.

WORKAROUND
==========

Although SFM is not displayed in the Network Settings Installed Network Software
list, entries for AppleTalk protocol are added to the Windows NT bindery. As a
result, you must modify the registry to enable SFM.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

   SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\AppleTalk\Parameters

3. Highlight DefaultPort.

4. From the Edit menu, choose String.

5. Add the following value:

   \Device\CE2NDIS31

6. Highlight DesiredZone.

7. From the Edit menu, choose String.

8. Add the correct AppleTalk zone.

9. Close Registry Editor, and then shut-down and restart Windows NT.

Macintosh clients should now be able to connect to the Windows NT Server.

NOTE: Every time you attempt to configure SFM from Control Panel, the following
error message appears:

   The AppleTalk protocol registry parameters cannot be read. One or more
   parameters might be missing or contain invalid entries.

Consequently, changes to SFM must be made through Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server versions 3.5,
3.51, and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
