SYMPTOMS
========

If you Windows NT Backup (NTBACKUP) or a third-party backup program, and your
Exabyte 8505 drive is set for No Compression, the second time you back up files
it takes longer than it did the first time. This problem occurs regardless of
which backup software you use.

CAUSE

The Exabyte 8505 drive is initialized for compression on the first backup even
though No Compression is selected. Subsequent backups are not be performed with
compression. This problem occurs with high performance EISA or local bus SCSI
controller cards which support high data transfer throughput.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, turn on hardware compression for all backups. If
you are running NTBACKUP, select Hardware Compression in the Backup dialog box.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT version 3.51.
