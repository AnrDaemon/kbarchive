SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how a Systems Management Server administrator can remove
Systems Management Server clients from a Systems Management Server site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To remove a Systems Management Server client, run the appropriate Client Setup
application with the /R switch. This is documented in Appendix B of the Systems
Mangement Server Administrator's Guide. You must run Client Setup twice because
it has to stop all Systems Management Server components before the files can be
removed. You can do this by running Smsls.bat from the logon script or command
prompt, or by running Client Setup directly from the proper
..\SMS_SHR\<Platform>.Bin directory for the Systems Management Server
client platform.

You can also run DEINSTAL from the Systems Management Server logon server SMS_SHR
share. All site SMS logon servers have Deinstal.bat and Deinstal.cmd files in
the SMS_SHR share. These files, when run from a Systems Management Server
client, determine the operating system that is being used and run the correct
version of Client Setup with the /R switch (for example, CLI_NT /R). This
configures the client to remove itself from the Systems Management Server site
the next time Client Setup is run.
