TITLE   :TCP/IP Fails with SMC Ultra Elite 32 EISA Adapter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The TCP/IP protocol will not function with the SMC Ultra Elite 32 adapter if an
EISA SCSI adapter is installed on your computer. Windows NT 3.5 boots without
problems, but PING results in a "request time-out" message. If you boot
Microsoft Windows or Microsoft Windows for Workgroups first, and then soft-boot
Windows NT 3.5 (by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL), this configuration will work as
expected. It is only after you cold boot Windows NT 3.5 (turn the power off)
that TCP/IP malfunctions. If no SCSI EISA adapter is present, TCP/IP works as
expected.

TEST
----

This problem was reproduced under the following configurations:

 - Dell 466Me, SMC Ultra Elite adapter, Adaptec 2742 or BUSLOGIC SCSI EISA
   Adapter

 - ALR SMP Revolution Dual Pentium, BUSLOGIC SCSI EISA Adapter

RESOLUTION
==========

Run EISA configuration and disable Bus Mastering on the SMC adapter. Install the
SMC patch, SMC8232N.SYS (file size: 45,344, file date: 11/16/94). This patch can
be found on SMC's BBS at (516) 434-3162. The file to look for is called
CNT105.EXE, a self-extracting zip file.

NOTE: If you use the Micronics EISA configuration utility to disable bus
mastering, the option is labeled "ADAPTER TIMING" with choices of "PRIMARY" or
"ALTERNATE". ALTERNATE is the required choice.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
