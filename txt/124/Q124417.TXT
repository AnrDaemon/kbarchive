SYMPTOMS
========

When you play a video clip, you may experience any of the following symptoms:

 - The system may hang (stop responding).
 - The video may flash.
 - Distortion is observed in the video playback area.
 - The video may just show a blank window, a white window, or a black window,
   even though the sound plays correctly.
 - Some computers may experience hesitation problems with the video, where it
   continually starts and stops instead of playing smoothly.
 - Videos only play in the large or expanded mode. The normal mode videos do not
   play.

 - Compaq Prolinea and Compaq Presario computers using the Compaq/ET4000-W32 640

RESOLUTION
==========

To solve this problem, add the following line to the [drawdib] section of the
Win.ini file:

   dva=0


MORE INFORMATION
================

The "dva=0" entry turns off direct video access (DVA) and DCI, components of
Microsoft Video For Windows. DVA and DCI allow video images to be sent directly
to the screen. If an application detects the display type incorrectly, problems
can occur using DVA and DCI. Some of these problems can be severe (such as
general protection (GP) faults in Gdi.exe). When you turn off DVA and DCI, video
images must be drawn through GDI. Although using GDI can be slower than direct
access, it is safer. This problem does not occur when using Microsoft Video for
Windows version 1.1d or later.
