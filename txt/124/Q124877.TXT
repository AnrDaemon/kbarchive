TITLE   :PRB: Error 6 RPC_S_PROTSEQ_NOT_SUPPORTED in 16-bit Application
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork kb16bitonly kbAPI kbRPC kbSDKPlatform kbOSWin310 kbGrpDSNet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When trying to run a 16-bit RPC application, the RpcBindingFromStringBinding()
may return error number 6. In the RPCERR.H file, this is defined as:

      RPC_S_PROTSEQ_NOT_SUPPORTED

CAUSE
=====

Unlike Windows NT, the 16-bit environments do not automatically install the RPC
runtime files and drivers. If the driver for the protocol sequence your are
using is not installed, or is not in your path, RpcBindingFromStringBinding()
will fail with error code 6.

RESOLUTION
==========

The 16-bit RPC runtimes and drivers ship with the Win32 SDK. You can install
them from the CD by going to the \mstools\rpc_dos\disk1 directory on the CD and
running setup. By default, the installation should install all drivers. If you
want to verify that, choose the custom install option.

After the drivers are installed, you will need to make sure that they are in your
path before attempting to run a 16-bit RPC application.

NOTE: You must install the 16-bit drivers even if you are running your 16-bit
application on a Windows NT host.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows drivers have the extension .DLL and DOS drivers have the extension .RPC.
The driver names and the protocol sequence they support are as follows:

   rpc16c1    - Named Pipes
   rpc16c3    - TCP/IP
   rpc16dg3   - UDP/IP
   rpc16c4    - DEC Net
   rpc16c5    - NetBIOS
   rpc16c6    - SPX
   rpc16dg6   - IPX
