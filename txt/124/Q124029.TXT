TITLE   :No Site-Based Mapping for Single-Domain-Multiple-Site Clients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork smsgeneral kbArtTypeINF

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you implement logon scripts with Smsls.bat on a single master user domain
that is split over several sites, you find that a client can be mapped to a
server in the correct domain, but in the wrong site.

CAUSE
=====

The SETLS program randomly picks a server from that domain that could be another
site server and, therefore, prevents the use of logon scripts per site.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has modified the files Setls32.exe, Setls16.exe, and Setlsos2.exe to
correct this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
