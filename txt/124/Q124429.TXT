TITLE   :SMS Shared Version of Works 3.0 Displays OLE Error on Startup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop smsgeneral kbArtTypeINF

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After configuring and distributing Microsoft Works 3.0 as a Systems Management
Server shared application, an OLE registration error message appears when you
attempt to start Works. After choosing OK, Works runs normally with no further
errors.

CAUSE
=====

OLE applications are supposed to update their Registry entries on startup to
reflect the actual locations from which they run. Works is reporting an error if
these settings are as expected. In this instance, Works objects to the SMS proxy
applications file specification in its OLE Registry entries. This has no effect
on how OLE and the MSAPPS proxies work as the actual path is resolved when an
MSAPPs program is executed. The message is a warning and not an indication that
Works is improperly configured.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.0. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.1.
