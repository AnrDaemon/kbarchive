KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Cinemania for Windows 1995 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Pss.bat file located in the Aamsstp\Manual folder on the
Microsoft Cinemania 1995 compact disc, you receive the error message "Path not
found" after the first seven files are copied.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, do the following:

1. Run the Pss.bat file.

2. Make the system changes described in the Msetup.txt file.

3. At an MS-DOS prompt, copy all the files from the Aamsstp\System folder
   (subdirectory) on the compact disc to the Windows\System folder on your hard
   disk. For example, if your CD-ROM drive is drive X, and your hard disk drive
   is drive C, to copy the files, type the following line and press ENTER:

   "copy x:\aamsstp\system\*.* c:\windows\system" (without the quotation marks)

MORE INFORMATION
================

The manual installation batch file for Cinemania 1995 does not specify the
correct path name for most of the files it is supposed to copy. The batch file
specifies the System directory as the source for the files, but the files are
actually in the Aamsstp\System folder.

CAUTION: The manual installation batch file for Cinemania 1995 should not be used
on computers running Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows NT.
