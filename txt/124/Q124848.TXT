TITLE   :Adding an NDIS 3.1 Protocol Does Not Add Frame Type to NET.CFG
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The NDIS 3.1 protocol that you added to Network Setup does not function
properly.

CAUSE
=====

If you add an NDIS 3.1 protocol to Windows 95 and you use ODI drivers, the
appropriate frame type is not added to the NET.CFG file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, manually add the appropriate frame type to the NET.CFG
file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Network Setup for Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11 adds four frame
types to the NET.CFG file:

   FRAME ETHERNET_802.2
   FRAME ETHERNET_802.3
   FRAME ETHERNET_II
   FRAME ETHERNET_SNAP

When you install an NDIS protocol, it can find the frame type because it is
already available. On some occasions, the behavior of Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11 can block access to your Novell NetWare server.

Rather than add all frame types to the NET.CFG file, Windows 95 requires that you
add them manually.
