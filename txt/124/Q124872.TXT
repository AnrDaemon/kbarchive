TITLE   :Err Msg: Setup Requires a Local Hard Disk That is Visible
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to upgrade a computer that is running Windows NT and using
mirrored hard disk drives to a later version of Windows NT the following error
appears:

   Setup requires a local Hard Drive that is visible at startup which requires
   at least 36 MB of free disk space in order to upgrade Windows NT. No such
   drive was found.

CAUSE
=====

Setup determines, from the first partition ID byte on the hard disk drive, that
the disk is part of a fault tolerant disk configuration. Because Setup does not
distinguish between mirrored sets and any other type of fault tolerant
configuration, Setup stops.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error also occurs on some hardware implementations mirrored set, fault
tolerant drives.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, break the mirrored set, install Windows NT on the
primary partition, and then reestablish the mirror.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
