TITLE   :SMTP: Err Msg: Socket Error (123) When Starting Gateway
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.x
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.x 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft 32-bit version TCP/IP for Windows for Workgroups,
SMTPGATE.EXE will generate an error and the gateway will fail to operate. The
user will see the following error message on the screen or in the smtpgate.log
if the the -l logging parameter is used:

   ERROR socket: (123) network error
   SMTP_listen: system error

CAUSE
=====

This error message is generated because the SMTPGATE.EXE program works with the
LAN Manager API called sockets.exe. It does not work with Winsock APIs. The SMTP
Gateway was developed before Windows for Workgroups and the WFW 32- bit version
of TCP/IP.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, use the 16-bit version of TCP/IP and load SOCKETS.EXE
before starting the gateway. The 16 bit version of TCP/IP can be found on any of
our electronic services as the self-extracting file wfwtcp.exe. See Q96244 and
Q105288 for related information.
