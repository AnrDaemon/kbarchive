======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Adding file filters is an all or nothing process; the process overrides all of
the default file filters intrinsic to Visual C++. This article gives you a
step-by-step way to add file filters to the Microsoft Visual C++ development
environment.

NOTE: This functionality was unsupported in Visual C++ 2.0 and was removed from
Visual C++ 4.0.

WARNING: This process involves modifying the system registry, a process usually
done by applications, not people. Errors in editing the registry may result in
undefined behavior. The use of the registry to override the default file filters
in Visual C++ may be revised in future versions of Visual C++.

Step-by-Step Method to Add File Filters to Visual C++
-----------------------------------------------------

1. Start REGEDT32.EXE (located in the \SYSTEM32 subdirectory of the Windows NT
   directory).

2. From the HKEY_CURRENT_USER tree:

    - Double-click Software.

    - Double-click Microsoft.

    - Double-click Visual C++ 2.0

    - Double-click File Filters, which should be empty if this is the first
      anyone has added file filters for Visual C++.

3. From the Edit menu, choose Add Value to bring up the Add Value dialog box.

4. In the Value Name field, type "CommonOpen" (without the quotation marks).
   This is the Name field for the first entry in the File Filter Entry List (see
   below). Click the OK button. Note that all entries are of type REG_SZ. Now
   you have a String Editor dialog box.

5. Type "Common Files (*.mak;*.c;*.cpp;*.cxx;*.h;*.rc)" (without the quotation
   marks) in the String Editor dialog box. This is the Data field for the first
   entry in the File Filter Entry List. Click the OK button.

6. Repeat steps 3 through 5 for the remainder of the entry list.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Name:            CommonOpen
Data:            Common Files (*.mak;*.c;*.cpp;*.cxx;*.h;*.rc)

Name:            CommonProject
Data:            Common Files (*.c;*.cpp;*.cxx;*.rc;*.def;*.odl)

Name:            Filter1
Data:            7,Source Files (*.c;*.cpp;*.cxx)

Name:            Filter2
Data:            7,Header Files (*.h;*.hpp;*.hxx)

Name:            Filter3
Data:            7,Resource Files (*.rc)

Name:            Filter4
Data:            1,Image Files (*.bmp;*.dib;*.ico;*.cur)

Name:            Filter5
Data:            5,Projects (*.mak)

Name:            Filter6
Data:            1,Browse Info Files (*.bsc)

Name:            Filter7
Data:            1,Executable Files (*.exe;*.dll;*.drv)

Name:            Filter8
Data:            7,Definition Files (*.def)

Name:            Filter9
Data:            2,Object Description Files (*.odl)

Name:            Filter10
Data:            2,Library Files (*.lib)

Name:            Filter11
Data:            2,Object Files (*.obj)

Each data field begins with a number. The number is a bit-field that indicates
what kind of lists that should use the filters:

 - 1 means use this File Filter in a File Open list.

 - 2 means use this File Filter in a Project Files list.

 - 4 means use this File Filter in a Find in Files list (reserved, but not used
   yet).

The values 5 and 7 are the logical AND of the values 1, 2, and 4.

NOTE: If the Visual C++ version 2.0 registry is corrupted, it may be deleted. The
next time you run Visual C++, you will be warned that the registry does not
exist and a new, default registry will be built.
