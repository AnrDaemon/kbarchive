-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows NT can print to most Hewlett-Packard (HP) JetDirect network printer
cards using either the data link control (DLC) protocol or the TCP/IP
protocol using Line Printer Remote (LPR)/Line Printer Daemon (LPD).
However, not all JetDirect cards support all protocols. The firmware
revision of a JetDirect card determines its ability to work with Windows NT
network printing protocols.

The following list outlines the Windows NT protocols and capabilities
supported by the different HP JetDirect firmware revisions.

Version         Description
--------        -----------------------------------------------------------

A.03.03         Fully supports LPD for TCP/IP printing and DLC with
or later        automatic protocol switching in any HP printer that
                supports the card.


A.03.00 -       Fully supports DLC with protocol switching in any HP
  A.03.02       printer that supports the card. This firmware
                revision does not support LPD. Therefore, even though it
                does support TCP/IP, it does not work with the Windows NT
                LPR TCP/IP printing client.

A.02.0x         Supports DLC, but can only use protocol switching on
                an HP 4Si. If you are using another printer, the other
                protocols must be disabled for Windows NT DLC to work
                properly. This firmware revision does not support LPD.
                Therefore, even though it does support TCP/IP, it will not
                work with Windows NT's LPR TCP/IP printing client.

A.01.0x         Supports DLC, but all other protocols must be disabled.
                There is no protocol switching support with this firmware
                revision on any HP printer.


A.00.0x         No DLC support, will not work with Windows NT.

The firmware revision of an HP JetDirect card can normally be found by
printing the printer self-test page on a printer with the card installed.
The revision number is preceded by:
