SUMMARY
=======

Page 219 of the Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.0 "Administrator's
Guide," shows the following syntax for the RUL2CFG.BAT file:

      rul2cfg packagerulefile cfgfile

For the audit process to work correctly, the package rule file output file must
be named AUDIT.CFG; you cannot use an arbitrary filename.

When the package rule file process completes, AUDIT.CFG is placed in the
appropriate platform directory. For example, for Intel-based platforms, the file
is placed in the SMS\PRIMSITE.SRV\AUDIT\PACKAGE\X86.BIN directory. You can test
this file by running AUDIT32.EXE. If the file is named and compiled correctly,
you will see the Audit Status count slowly to 100 percent. If the file is
incorrectly named, the Audit Status immediately displays 100 percent.
