TITLE   :Canon BubbleJet BJC-800 Prints Slowly Under Windows NT 3.5
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under Windows NT 3.5, printing to the Canon BubbleJet BJC-800 printer is
significantly slower when compared to the printing speed under Windows 3.1 or
Windows for Workgroups.

CAUSE
=====

Under Windows NT 3.5, the drivers for Canon BubbleJet printers do not support
different kinds of paper media. Because of this limitation, Mode D on the
BJC-800 is selected for printing, as the type of paper being used can't be
determined and Mode D can print to any type.

However, Mode D is significantly slower than other printing modes for the Canon
BJC-800, because the paper being used may need more precise ink layout in order
to produce acceptable output. According to Canon, Mode D may take more than 10
minutes to print a single page.

Under 16-bit Windows, Canon has written drivers which support multiple paper
media types. Mode A can be used when you are printing on coated paper. Mode A is
much faster than Mode D.


WORKAROUND
==========

The only method for printing faster under Windows NT is to send a first page
with some random text, pause the printer, and then manually select Mode A. Once
the printer is restarted, it will print the rest of that document faster. This
can be a useful workaround for long documents.
