TITLE   :Very Large or Very Small Transfers to SCSI Printers Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your computer stops responding (hangs) if the SCSIPRNT driver is loaded and a
SCSI printer is connected.

CAUSE
=====

SCSIPRINT does not handle transfers correctly when they are smaller than the
maximum transfer length of the device in question. In addition, on large
transfers, it assumes that the request is either a 10-byte SCSI Read or SCSI
Write command, but SCSI printers use a 6-byte SCSI Print command. When the
10-byte write command is issued, the SCSI printer rejects the command as an
illegal request.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version
3.5. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
