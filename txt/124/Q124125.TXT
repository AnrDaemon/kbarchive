The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you start the Form Builder in Visual FoxPro version 3.0, a generic form is
created for you by default. You can then modify or change this generic default
form to make a custom default form. Then this customized template can be used
with the Form Builder.

This article shows by example how to create a custom default form.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you create your own Base Class, you are creating a subclass of Visual
FoxPro's base class. A Form is a Base Class in Visual FoxPro. You can create a
new subclass of the Base Class Form that can act as the default Form. This
allows you to set a form the way you like it (background, color, logo, fonts,
and so on). Then you can have Visual FoxPro call your design as the default
(base) form whenever you create a new form.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a form the way you want it. Then from the File menu, choose Save As
   Class. In the next dialog, select the the Current Form check box, and give
   the name of the class and the .VCX file where it will be stored.

2. Choose Options From the Tools Menu.

3. Select the Controls Tab, and add the Class library in which this form class
   is stored. This process is called "registering" the class library.

4. Select the Forms Design tab. The registered library should appear in the Form
   edit box of the Template Classes region. If no libraries are listed, click
   the check box next to 'Form:' and select your class library. If you have more
   than one form class, select the one you want to be the default. (Look for it
   on the right-hand side, under Class Name.)

5. Click OK.

6. Create a new form. It should have the properties of your template.
