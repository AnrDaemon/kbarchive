-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the received date field may
display the month as "MM." For example, the date may display as

   MM/14/94

instead of:

   12/14/94

RESOLUTION
==========

Check the following settings:

1. Run Windows Control Panel and choose the Date/Time icon. Make sure the date
   and time are correct.

2. Run Windows Control Panel and choose International. Make sure the settings
   are correct for your situation. For example:

   Country: United States
   Language: English (American)
   Keyboard Layout: US
   Measurement: English
   List Separator: ,

   Check the International Date and Time formats, as well as the Long Date
   Format, making sure the order is correct (in this example, MDY).

3. In the WIN.INI file, check the international ([intl]) section. It should have
   the following two entries.

   [intl]
   sShortDate=M/d/yy
   sLongDate=dddd, MMMM dd, yyyy

The settings should match the ones above. If they have extra characters or if
they contain the wrong separator character, the problem described above may
occur. If you are unsure about the format of the lines in the [intl] section,
try comparing yours to the [intl] section of another installation that is not
experiencing the problem.
