The information in this article applies to:

 - Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores the Human Body for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your computer may stop responding (hang) when you click the Exit signs that
appear in various places in Explores The Human Body if you are using an S3 864
or S3 964 video chip set and driver.


RESOLUTION
==========

WORKAROUND
----------

To work around this problem, exit the program without clicking the Exit signs.
Clicking the Exit sign takes you through an animated exit sequence, which makes
the computer stop responding.

To avoid the exit signs, press and hold down the ALT key while you press the F4
function key (ALT+F4).

NOTE: If you use the ALT+F4 exit sequence, information about the places you have
visited is saved.

In some instances, usually with newer versions of the S3 drivers, it is possible
to resolve the problem by using Animation Option #1 in the Bus Stop Utility,
instead of using ALT+F4 to exit.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The S3 864 and S3 964 chip sets are relatively new (late 1994), and there is no
known driver that allows them to function correctly in the Exit sequence in
Magic School Bus Explores the Human Body.

NOTE: The S3 964 driver may not work with all S3 964 chipsets because many OEM
companies modify the video card in such a way that only their own drivers will
work.

The S3 products included here are manufactured by S3, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
