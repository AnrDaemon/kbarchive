TITLE   :BUG: F2374: Incorrect Reference of the Error in BLOCK DATA
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to multiply initialize a data, in a BLOCK DATA program unit causes
the compiler to issue the F2374 error message below in the wrong location.

   error F2374: 'symbol' redefinition; multiple initialization

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the products listed above. We are
researching this bug and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code demonstrates the problem. The error F2374 is reported on the
end statement of the first routine in the file, rather than the block data where
the error occurred. This is true regardless of the relative positions or other
intervening routines.

Sample Code
-----------

   C Compile options needed: none

          subroutine y()
          write(*,*) 'cat'
          end

          block data initerr
          common /errz/ nerr
          data  nerr /0/, nerr /1/ 
          end
