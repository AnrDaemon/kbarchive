TITLE   :MHS: Err Msg: Error Getting Memory. Not Enough RAM...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.0; :3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS Access, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS or Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS Access
installation program may report the following error:

   Error getting memory. Not enough RAM to create postoffice list

CAUSE
=====

There is not enough memory to install the addressing component of the MHS
gateway when more than 430 postoffice definitions exist on the local postoffice.

RESOLUTION
==========

A possible workaround is to delete several postoffice definitions from the local
postoffice before you install the access component. These postoffices can then
be redefined after the access component is successfully installed. Deleting
postoffices affects users in two ways:

 - Removing a postoffice definition also removes the address list for that
   postoffice. The address list can be imported again after the postoffice is
   reinstalled.

 - Because the postoffice address list (POL) is removed, any entries in a
   personal address list (PAL) referring to a user on a deleted postoffice will
   no longer work. These entries will also have to be deleted and re-created
   after the new postoffice address list is re- created.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.0 of the Microsoft
Mail Gateway to MHS and Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS Access. This problem is
corrected in INSTALL.EXE version 3.0.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you specify the name of the network for the postoffice on which you are
installing, the installation program builds a DLLIST of all known postoffices on
that network. After the list is compiled, you are prompted for the name of the
postoffice on which you want to install. The installation program then takes
your user name and scans for it in the postoffice list stored in memory. This is
how the installation program verifies it has a valid postoffice.

The problem is that each postoffice structure in the DLLIST takes 106 bytes; in
addition, the DLL item itself is another 6 bytes. Therefore, the total size is
112 bytes.
