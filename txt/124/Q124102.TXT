======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

After you receive an "Out of paper" message and refill the paper tray on a
Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet 560c, the printer still does not print. Clicking
Retry in the message box does not restart the printer; instead, the message is
repeated.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by the capabilities of the DeskJet 560c printer. This
printer does not automatically start after the paper tray is refilled.

RESOLUTION
==========

To start the printer, press the Load/Eject button on the printer. The job, and
any subsequent jobs, then prints.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior has also been reported to occur with the HP LaserJet 5MP.
