TITLE   :UT1x: Upsizing Wizard Incorrectly Converts Extended Characters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Access Distribution Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Access Upsizing Tools 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Access Upsizing Tools Upsizing Wizard to transfer
tables from Microsoft Access version 2.0 to Microsoft SQL Server, certain
extended ASCII characters in table or field names are not transferred as
underscore characters as they should be. When the Upsizing Wizard creates items
such as triggers, rules, and defaults for these tables or fields, however, it
refers to the underscore character that should have been used, instead of to the
extended character. For example, if you have a table with a counter field named

   

   <accented A>bracadabra

the INSERT trigger will reference the field as

   

   _bracadabra

even though the field will still be named:

   

   <accented A>bracadabra

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, replace the extended characters in table or field
names with an underscore character in Microsoft Access before you transfer the
tables to Microsoft SQL Server. Characters with a value greater than 128 can
exhibit this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Access Upsizing
Tools version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
