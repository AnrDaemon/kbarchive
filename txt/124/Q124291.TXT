TITLE   :FIX: Access Violation When Using Local Static Const Objects
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 1.0, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Instantiating a class object that is defined as a local static const may cause
runtime access violations. For example, if you run the sample code listed in the
"More Information" section of this article, it triggers the system error dialog
box to appear with either the application error or the following text at run
time:

   Unhandled Exception in xxxx.exe: 0xC0000005: Access Violation


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use one of these suggestions:

 - Remove the const declaration from the local static class object.

-or-

 - Do not instantiate the object as static.

-or-

 - Instantiate a global static const object instead of a local one.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++,
32-bit Edition, version 4.0.
