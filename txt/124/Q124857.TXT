-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.2, and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, the
Message Transfer Agent (EXTERNAL.EXE) may appear to execute correctly but no
mail is transferred, and no error message is generated. External will only
attach to postoffices on M:.

CAUSE
=====

If EXTERNAL.EXE fails to find an [External] section in an EXTERNAL.INI file, it
assumes the postoffice on drive M: is both the Home postoffice and the only
connected postoffice.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add [External] to the beginning of the section in the EXTERNAL.INI file which
contains the basic startup information of the MTA.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.00a 3.20 3.20a
