TITLE   :DC21040 Causes Windows NT 3.5 to Stop Responding (Hang)
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Network connections on your Windows NT computer are lost, new users cannot
connect, and applications requiring network access stop responding (hang).
Applications running locally may continue to function, but may also eventually
hang.

CAUSE
=====

You are using the DC21040.SYS Ethernet driver. A problem with the driver causes
the protocol to run out of resources when dealing with loopback packets. The
system becomes unable to accept anymore incoming packets from the adapter.
Loopback occurs when an application is accessing a local resource (for example,
a UNC file name) rather than a local driver letter.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Windows NT Server version 3.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest
U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.5. For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
