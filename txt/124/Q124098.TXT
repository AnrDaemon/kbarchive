TITLE   :Browse List Incomplete When Using RAS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.11 3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you browse the network from a Windows for Workgroups computer connected to
a Windows NT Remote Access server, you receive an incomplete browse list. The
browse list displays computers that are using the NWLink protocol. You are not
able to view computers using only the NetBEUI protocol. However, you are allowed
to directly connect to any computer on the network by specifying the exact
server and share names.

CAUSE
=====

If you are using the IPX/SPX Compatible Transport (NWLink) and NetBEUI
protocols, this problem occurs when NWLink is being bound to the Server and
Workstation services before being bound to NetBEUI.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the binding order of the Server and
Workstation services so that NetBEUI is bound before NWLink, and then restart
Windows NT.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
