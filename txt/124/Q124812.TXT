SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using the Ensoniq sound card when running the programs listed at the
top of this article, the system may stop responding (hang), or return you to
Windows (or back to MS-DOS) after the Microsoft Home logo and the program's
splash screen appears. In MSB Ocean, it hangs on Ms. Frizzle waving.

In Explorapedia, you may also receive an error message similar to the following:

   Explorapedia error 800xxxxxx-x (or 48xxx-xx)

   An error occurred while starting Explorapedia. Restart Windows and try again.
   If that fails to correct the problem, run Setup from the Explorapedia CD-ROM
   again.

NOTE: All Explorapedia error messages that begin with Explorapedia Error
800xxxxxx-x (or 480xx-xx) refer to sound problems.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when the Ensoniq sound card is not configured correctly for
both primary and secondary wave playback.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use these steps to configure the Ensoniq sound card correctly to run the
programs listed at the top of this article in Windows 3.x:

1. Determine the type of CD-ROM drive (for example, NEC).

2. Open the Main program group, run Control Panel, and double-click the Drivers
   icon.

3. Select the Soundscape DVD/MIDI/WAV/AUX driver.

4. Press the Setup button, and configure the setup as follows:

                                     CD-ROM Manufacturer
                                  ------------------------
                                  NEC     Mitsumi     Sony
      DMA                          0        1           1
      Wave Playback A              3        3           3
      Wave Playback B              1      5 or 0        0
      Wave 16 Bit                  5     NO CHANGE  NO CHANGE

   NOTE: The Reveal Multimedia Kits that include the Sound FX 32 cards should be
   configured using the Sony settings.

5. Choose OK, and then Close.

6. Close Control Panel and exit Windows.

7. Restart the computer.

After following these steps, you should be able to run the programs listed at the
top if this article successfully.

NOTE: Some devices, such as a SCSI adapter card, may already be using DMA
channels 0 or 3. In that case, a different DMA channel should be selected for
the sound card.


If the steps above do not correct the problem, obtain and install the updated
drivers for the Ensoniq sound card. For information about how to obtain the
Ensoniq sound card drivers, see the "Resolution" section in the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

NOTE: This problem can also occur if you are using earlier Ensoniq SoundScape
sound tools on your system.
