TITLE   :PC Win: Setup Err Msg: Could Not Create Directory F:\TMP.INI
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, Setup creates a
TMP.INI directory in the root directory of the installation drive. Setup may
fail with the following error message,

   Could not create directory F:\TMP.INI

when run on a Novell NetWare network if the Windows Mail client files are located
on a shared drive that is mapped as a logical drive.

Typically, each user under NetWare has a home directory from which to execute
Setup. If your NetWare account has restrictions on the root directory of the
network drive (for example, create restrictions), then Setup will fail because
it cannot create the TMP.INI directory.

Setup does not make use of a temporary directory environment variable like TEMP.
In order to complete, Setup needs to create the TMP.INI directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows. This problem was corrected in the SETUP.EXE and
SETUP.INF files included in SETUPD.EXE.

   directory on the network share.
