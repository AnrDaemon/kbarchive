TITLE   :BUG: Invalid Connection String Error with Certain Passwords
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbBug kbISS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG# QJET: 1588 (2.00.2317)

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to connect to a Microsoft Access data source, SQLConnect may
return an error for those account whose password contains a semicolon (;). The
error message returned is:

   SQLSTATE="01S00",
   szErrorMsg="[Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access 2.0 Driver]Invalid
   connection string attribute <xxxx>"

For example, assume a user account has a login id of John and a password of ;John
in the Microsoft Access database and the data source name is mysource.

Then

   SQLConnect(hdbc,"mysource",8,"John",4,";John",,5)

returns

   SQLSTATE="01S00",
   szErrorMsg="[Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access 2.0 Driver]Invalid
   connection string attribute John"

CAUSE
=====

The problem happens because a semicolon is a separator in the connection string
and having it in the password causes a conflict.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you can use the SQLDriverConnect call and either do
not pass a password or pass an incorrect password. As a result, you are prompted
for the password. When prompted, you can enter the password with the semicolon,
and the connection will succeed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in ODBC Access Driver version
2.00.2317. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
