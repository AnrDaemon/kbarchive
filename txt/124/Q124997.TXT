TITLE   :HP PC LAN Adapters Not Listed in Network Client Version 3.0
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:winnt:3.0,3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install the Hewlett-Packard (HP) PC LAN series adapter
drivers in the Network Client version 3.0 for MS-DOS Setup program, they are not
available in the list of network adapter drivers. These network adapter drivers
are shipped with the network operating system and are located in the Windows NT
Server version 3.5 CD.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the HP PC LAN adapter drivers are commented out in
the NETWORK.INF, SETUP.INF, WCNET.INF and WCSETUP.INF files. WCNET.INF and
WCSETUP.INF files are pre-Setup files and NETWORK.INF and SETUP.INF are
post-Setup files.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

1. If you have not installed Network Client version 3.0 for MS-DOS, modify the
   WCSETUP.INF file. If you have already installed Network Client, modify the
   SETUP.INF file. In the [netdrivers] section, remove the semicolon (;) in
   front of each line and save the file(s):

         ;1=,hplanb.dos,,hplanb.dos,
         ;1=,hplanp.dos,,hplanp.dos,

2. If you have not installed Network Client version 3.0 for MS-DOS, modify the
   WCNET.INF file. If you have already installed Network Client, modify the
   NETWORK.INF file. In the following sections, remove the semicolons (;) in
   front of each line and save the file:
