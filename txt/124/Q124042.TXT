KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you select Config, DirSync, Requestor, Import from versions 3.00, 3.00b,
and 3.20 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Mail Administrator, the following
error message appears:

   Notice 40
   Error in sending updated users and groups.
   Press Enter to continue

CAUSE
=====

This error message has several causes:

1. Missing P1 subdirectory.

2. Missing MAI subdirectory(s).

3. Missing CONTROL.GLB.

4. Corrupt CONTROL.GLB with file size less than 8 bytes.

5. Missing INQUEUE.MBG.

6. Missing INQUEUE.KEY.

7. Corrupt INQUEUE.KEY with file size less than 560 bytes.

RESOLUTION
==========

The resolutions to the possible causes of this error are as follows:

1. Create a P1 subdirectory in the root of the database.

2. Create missing MAI subdirectory(s) in appropriate locations.

3. Restore the CONTROL.GLB from a recent backup. Both of the values stored in
   the CONTROL.GLB will have to be incremented to suitably larger values.

4. Same solution as #3.

5. The INQUEUE.KEY and INQUEUE.MBG both need to be reset. As follows:

   M:\MBG>type nul > inqueue.mbg
   M:\KEY>debug inqueue.key
   -f100,32f,0
   -w
   -q

6. Same solution as #5.

7. Same solution as #5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A Config, DirSync, Requestor, Import (CDRI) can only be performed on a
requestor. Therefore, this error message will never be generated on the
Directory Synchronization Server (DSS). The actual error message text may also
appear as follows:

   Notice 40
   Error file not accessible
   Check server connection
   Press Enter to continue

This message text is displayed if the user did not install the Administration
utilities off of the Setup disk. The "Notice 40" still implies the same error as
described above. However, the message text displayed is different due to the
fact that the database did not have the appropriate Admin error message file in
the database (ERRORADM.GLB).

Additional query words: CDRI
