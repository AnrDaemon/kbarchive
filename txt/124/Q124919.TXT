TITLE   :RAS Event 20026: Remote Access Server Security Failure
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Remote Access Server (RAS) service on a multihomed
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) computer set up to
receive TCP/IP dial-in clients, the following event is written to the System
Log:

Event ID: 20026
Source: RemoteAccess
Type: Error
Description: Remote Access Server Security Failure. A network error has  occurred when you try to establish a session with the security agent on   LANA x. The error code is the data.

where x is the LANA number of your network card.

This error does not cause problems with RAS service.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the RAS service binds to two network interface cards
(NICs) on a multihomed TCP/IP computer, but only one network card is valid. The
network card connected to the subnet that you assign RAS clients TCP/IP
addresses from, is the network card that should be bound to the RAS service.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent the appearance of this event in the System Log, follow these steps:

1. Run Control Panel and select the Network icon.

2. Choose Bindings.

3. In the Show Bindings for:, select "Remote Access Server Service".

4. Select the binding for the TCP/IP protocol and NIC that you are not using for
   the RAS client, and then select Disable. For example, the binding entry may
   be:

   Remote Access Server Service -> TCP/IP Protocol -> <Adapter
   Driver>-> <Network Card>

5. Choose OK and restart Windows NT.
