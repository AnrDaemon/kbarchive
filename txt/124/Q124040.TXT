======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When messages using an A.M./P.M. time format stamp are converted from the MS-
DOS client to Microsoft Mail for Windows, the dates are incorrect.

CAUSE
=====

When messages with the A.M./P.M. style time format in the MS-DOS client are
converted to the Windows client, Mail adds 12 hours to the time if it is P.M.
This does not work if the message was sent during the noon hour.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0b and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows. This problem was corrected in version 3.2a (which
includes MSSFS.DLL version 3.2.0.4074).
