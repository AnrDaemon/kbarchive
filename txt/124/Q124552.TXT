SUMMARY
=======

The recommended user account limitation in Windows NT version 3.5 is 15,000
users in any one domain, and only on "large" hardware.

MORE INFORMATION
================

As a guideline for "large" hardware, a uniprocessor Pentium system with 32
megabytes (MB) of RAM can be configured to comfortably handle 10,000 users.

To accommodate this number of users on such a system, the Registry size limit
(RSL) must be set to 80 percent. For more information on the Registry size limit
query on the following keyword in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
