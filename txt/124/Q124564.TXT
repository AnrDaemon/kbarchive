TITLE   :MIDL Compiler Wraps the Operation Number After 255
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The RPC MIDL compiler (version 2.00.72) that ships with the Win 32 SDK appears
to only keep 8 bits of "Operation number" when it generates the stub code. This
creates a problem if you define more than 256 remote procedures. When operation
256 is to be called, operation 0 is really called instead because the call
number created by the MIDL compiler wrapped at 255.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you have more than 256 Remote Procedures defined, manually edit the output
file and correct the operation number. You can do this by examining the stub
code created by the MIDL compiler. The 4th parameter to the
NdrClientInitializeNew() wraps around after 255; edit this for each successive
procedure in the stub and increment it correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT version 3.51.
