SUMMARY
=======

An updated IBMTOK.DOS file (dated 10/18/94 1:12:42PM, with a file size of 10,112
bytes) is available to correct a timing problem with the original driver. This
problem occurs on Pentium 90 MHz (and faster) systems using the IBM Token Ring
16/4 card and a real-mode protocol. After you issue the NET START command, you
receive the following error message:

   Error 5736: The protocol manager reported a hardware failure.

To correct this error, replace your existing IBMTOK.DOS with the updated version.
