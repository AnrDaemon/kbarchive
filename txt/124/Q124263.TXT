The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

There is currently no Microsoft Remote Access Service (RAS) client for the
Macintosh available. However, Macintosh clients can dial in using a Point-
to-Point Protocol (PPP) client software on the Macintosh, or dial in to an Apple
Remote Access server on the network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some Common PPP client packages available for the Macintosh are:

 - FreePPP (shareware update of MacPPP)

 - OpenTransport PPP from Apple


When dialing in using Apple Remote Access software, you must install the Apple
Remote Access server on a Macintosh connected to the network. Apple Remote
Access software does not integrate with Microsoft RAS software and uses a
different modem line. However, you can connect to a Windows NT Server version
3.5 using Microsoft authentication using Chooser.
