SUMMARY
=======

The applications listed at the beginning of this article require a video display
driver of 256 or more colors. These applications will not run under the Standard
VGA display driver which supports only 16 colors. Art Gallery requires 256 color
capability for playing animation only. Note also that the CD Samplers may not
run properly with more than 256 colors.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A standard troubleshooting procedure is to run an application using the Standard
VGA display. When you test the applications, one or more of the following
approaches may be required:

 - Consult the Readme or Tips for the application to see if the problem you are
   having has been documented.

 - Use the Super VGA 256-color driver if the installed video card supports it.

 - Try different color depths. For example, if the system is configured for 256
   colors, change the display to 65K colors.

 - Try different resolutions. For example, if the system is configured for
   800-by-600 pixel resolution, change the resolution to 640-by-480 pixels.

 - If you are using a Large-Font display, change the corresponding font to a
   Small-Font display.

 - Update to the latest version of the video card driver. Often these change on
   a monthly basis.

 - Contact your hardware vendor for further suggestions.

NOTE: Microsoft Scholastic's The Magic School Bus Explores The Human Body for
Windows, ONLY runs with 256 colors. That is, you cannot run this program with
less than or more than 256 colors.

For more information on using these methods, consult your video card
documentation or readme file.
