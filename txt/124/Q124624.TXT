-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Complete Baseball, version 1994 edition 
 - Microsoft Complete Basketball, version '94-'95 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use a Microsoft Windows color scheme that uses white text, text
characters displayed on a white background in Microsoft Complete Baseball or
Microsoft Complete Basketball will be missing.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not use a Windows color scheme that uses white text (such as the Plasma Power
Saver color scheme). Since Microsoft Complete Baseball and Microsoft Complete
Basketball display text on a white background, white text will disappear.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To change the Windows color scheme you are using, follow these steps:

1. Double-click the Control Panel icon in the Main program group.

2. Double-click the Color icon.

3. In the Color Schemes box, select a scheme that does not use white text. For
   example, the Windows Default scheme does not use white text.

4. Choose the OK button.
