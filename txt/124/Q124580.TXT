KEYWORDS:kbprint kbimu kbPrintingkbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Explorapedia series: World of Nature for Windows, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Explorapedia series: World of People for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to print an article in Microsoft Explorapedia, the program may
seem to stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur for either of the following reasons:

 - Explorapedia does not include a printer interface, so you do not receive
   error messages or warnings when the printer requires attention.

 - Explorapedia is graphically oriented, so it prints articles slower than other
   programs. It may take a few moments after the "Printing in progress" message
   disappears before you regain control with the mouse.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows 95/98
-------------

If you wait several minutes and notice no response from the printer, follow these
steps to check the status of the print job:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Double-click the printer you want to use.

3. If you see an error message under in the Status column, resolve the printer
   error, or cancel the print job. To cancel a print job, follow these steps:
   a. Click the document.

   b. On the Document menu, click Cancel Printing.

      If you do not see a print status error, continue to wait for the print job
      to finish.

4. Click Explorapedia on the taskbar.

Windows 3.x
-----------

2. In the Task List box, click Print Manager, and then click Switch To.

   If you do not see Print Manager, click Program Manager in the Task List box,
   click Switch To, and then double-click Print Manager in the Main group in
   Program Manager.

3. If you see an error message under in the Status column, resolve the printer
   error, or cancel the print job. To cancel a print job, follow these steps:
   a. Click the document.

   b. On the Document menu, click Cancel Printing.
