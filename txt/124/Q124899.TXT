TITLE   :BUG: SQLNumResultCols May Fail After Prepared SQL Statement
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbBug kbISS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, versions 1.0, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG# AddonBugs: 10888 (1.02.3231)

SYMPTOMS
========

After preparing a SELECT statement, a call to an ODBC meta data function call,
such as SQLDescribeCol, SQLNumResultCols, and SQLColAttributes, fails with the
message:

   Syntax error near 'where'

This happens only if the above functions are called after SQLPrepare has been
called but before SQLExecute has been called. The following code demonstrates
the problem:

      SQLPrepare(hstmt, "select sum(qty) from sales group by stor_id")
      SQLNumResultCols(hstmt, &col)  ==> SQL_ERROR
      SQLError() ==> "Syntax error near 'where'"

CAUSE
=====

The SQL Server driver is sending an improperly constructed SQL statement to SQL
Server at the time SQLNumResultCols, SQLDescribeCol, and SQLColAttributes are
called.

WORKAROUND
==========

Because this problem appears only if SQLExecute has not been called, it is
recommended that meta data function calls be called after both SQLPrepare and
SQLExecute have been called.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the 16-bit Microsoft SQL Server
driver version 1.02.3231 and 32-bit SQL Server driver version 2.00.1912. We are
researching this problem and will post more information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
