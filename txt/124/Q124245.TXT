-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Logon scripts assigned to a user account run when the user logs on,
regardless of the user's workstation type. If the workstation is running
Windows for Workgroups, the LAN Manager Logon Script dialog box remains on
the screen until you choose Cancel. In LAN Manager 2.2, the logon process
creates a zero-byte file called LMSCRIPT.$$$. The presence of this file
indicates the logon script processing is complete.

To prevent the LAN Manager Logon Script dialog box from remaining on the
screen of a Windows for Workgroups computer, add the following commands as
the last two lines in the logon script batch file

      cd\<windir>
      echo>\<windir>\lmscript.$$$

where <windir> is your Windows for Workgroups directory.

The file is created and then deleted from the hard drive. When the script
completes, the dialog box is cleared from the screen; the domain validation
message subsequently appears.
