TITLE   :TAPI Apps Can't Dial Unless UniModem Is First Listed Provider
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

HyperTerminal, the Microsoft Network, or another TAPI-enabled application does
not dial.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when a pre-Windows 95 service provider appears in the
TELEPHON.INI file and precedes the Windows 95 Universal Modem Driver (UNIMDM). A
pre-Windows 95 service provider is one that was built to the Windows 3.1 TAPI,
rather than the Windows 95 TAPI.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Open the TELEPHON.INI file that is in your Windows directory with a text
   editor (such as WordPad).

2. The Providers section may appear as follows:

      [Providers]
      NumProviders=2
      NextProviderID=3
      ProviderID0=1
      ProviderFilename0=ATSP.TSP
      ProviderID1=2
      ProviderFilename1=UNIMDM.TSP

   Change the above to:

      [Providers]
      NumProviders=2
      NextProviderID=3
      ProviderID1=1
      ProviderFileName1=ATSP.TSP
      ProviderID0=2
      ProviderFileName0=UNIMDM.TSP

The above changes inform the TAPI.DLL file that UniModem is the first provider.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows Telephony application programming interface (TAPI) is the API that
allows your computer to manage your telephone system (data, fax, and voice).
