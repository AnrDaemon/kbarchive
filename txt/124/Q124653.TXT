OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to view an event detail generated by the source Windows
Internet Name Service (WINS) Event Viewer on a system that does not have WINS
installed, you may the following error message appears:

   The description for Event ID <xxxx> in Source WINS could not be found.

The <xxxx> variable represents the valid Event ID number.

CAUSE
=====

Event Viewer uses WINSEVNT.DLL provided by the WINS service to map the Event ID
to a detailed text message. If the WINS service is not installed, Event Viewer
fails to map the Event ID.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, expand WINSEVNT.DDL_ from the Windows NT Serve version
3.5 installation media to the %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32 subdirectory as
WINSEVNT.DLL.
