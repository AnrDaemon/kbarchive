TITLE   :Hcopy Does Not Preserve Hidden Attributes on Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::1.0,3.1,3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
 - Microsoft LAN Manager to Windows NT Advanced Server Upgrade, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you use the Hcopy utility (HCOPY.EXE) included with the LAN Manager to
Windows NT Advanced Server Upgrade and Windows NT Server 3.5 Upgrade for LAN
Manager, all Access Control Lists (ACLs) are preserved, but the hidden
attributes on files are not preserved.

WORKAROUND
==========

Manually replace the hidden attribute for the files using the MS-DOS ATTRIB.EXE
utility, or replace the hidden attribute using File Manager.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Advanced Server
version 3.1 and Windows NT Server version 3.5. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The upgrade uses the LAN Manager OS/2 Hcopy utility to transfer files across the
network. Hcopy is a modified version of the Xcopy command capable of preserving
hidden files and directories, and automatically preserves extended attributes
(additional file information such as file type, creator, and so on). It does not
copy system files.
