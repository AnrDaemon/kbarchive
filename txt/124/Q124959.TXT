TITLE   :Err Msg: ...the Package Requires an NTFS Drive to Install...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbScheduler smsscheduler

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A shared application package fails to be distributed to a NetWare server. The
DESPOOL.LOG file shows the following error:

   Server SMSDIST is not a Windows NT machine and the package requires an NTFS
   drive to install to, we'll skip this server.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the package source directory is on an NTFS partition and
has been shared as a Macintosh volume through Services for Macintosh. If a long
filename (LFN) is detected by the Systems Management Server Scheduler service,
while it compresses the package source directory, it includes an attribute
noting this package requires an NTFS partition in the instruction file. When the
SMS Despooler receives the package, it sees the indication that the package
requires an NTFS partition. Since there is no NTFS partition on the NetWare
server, it fails to install the package.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use Windows NT File Manager to remove the Macintosh volume from the SMS package
source directory or remove any long filenames from the package source directory
tree. Then resend and redistribute the package.
