SYMPTOMS
========

Multimedia applications that use the ACME Setup program may display the
following error message under certain conditions:

   Setup was unable to find SHARE.EXE on your system. It is required to run this
   application. Please fix your system and rerun Setup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The version of the ACME Setup program used by these applications requires and
searches for the SHARE.EXE command first by checking for its presence and
location in the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT files, and second by searching the
PATH specified in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. If it cannot find SHARE.EXE, it
displays the "Unable to find SHARE.EXE" error message. This can occur even if
SHARE.EXE is already loaded and running on your computer.

CAUSE
=====

The Setup program cannot find SHARE.EXE on the PATH in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file if
the name of the directory in which SHARE.EXE is located is not completely
specified (for example if \DOS is used instead of C:\DOS).

If an MS-DOS SUBST command has been used to replace the directory specification
in the PATH (for example, the command SUBST X: C:\DOS has been issued and X:\
appears in the PATH instead of C:\DOS), the Setup program will also fail to
locate SHARE.EXE.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Modify (or add if necessary) the PATH statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file so
   that it includes a complete specification of the directory where SHARE.EXE is
   located, including the drive letter.

2. Restart the computer so the change can take effect.

3. Run the multimedia Setup program again.
