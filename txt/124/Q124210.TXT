The Windows Sound System (WSS) version 2.0 Device Driver Development Kit
(DDK) includes all the tools necessary to write a driver for WSS-compliant
hardware. In additon, this DDK includes the files and documentation for the
Mixer Manager API. This DDK is useful for Windows application developers
who want to write Windows-based applications to control the audio mixing
capabilities of WSS-compliant audio hardware.

However, the Windows Sound System version 2.0 Device Driver Development Kik
(DDK) is not available on the October 1994 Edition of Microsoft Developer
Network (MSDN) Development Platform CD. To obtain the WSS version 2.0 DDK,
call Microsoft Sales at (800) 426-9400.

There are no plans to include the WSS DDK in the MSDN Development
Platform CD in the future.


NOTE: Because the Mixer Manager API is included in the Windows 95 SDK,
this is not an issue for those developing applications under Windows 95.
