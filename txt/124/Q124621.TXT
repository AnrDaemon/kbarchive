KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When the Schedule Service runs a job that was previously submitted by running
the AT utility, the environment space provided to the scheduled job includes
only the System Environment Variables.

The scheduled job's environment space does not include any User Environment
Variables.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To see which environment variables are available to scheduled jobs on your
machine, first run the following command specifying a <time> that is in
the near future:

   AT <time> /INTERACTIVE CMD

This will cause a new command window to open as a scheduled job at the specified
time. Type "SET" (without the quotes) in this command window to obtain a list of
Environment Variables available to scheduled jobs.

User and System Environment Variables can be defined by running the System applet
from within Control Panel.

To make environment variables available to scheduled jobs, make sure that they
are defined as System Environment Variables.

After modifying System Environment Variables it is necessary to shutdown and
restart your computer to make them available to applications.
