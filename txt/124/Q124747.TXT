SYMPTOMS
========

When using Macintosh Operating System 7.5 to find files on a Windows NT 3.5
Macintosh volume, the following error message appears after the query is
completed:

   The item <filename> is missing and was probably deleted. Other items
   may be affected; Checking them now.

A list of files that Macintosh file finder has found is then displayed. The files
are grayed out and inaccessible.

CAUSE
=====

On returning from the search, Find File calls AfpResolveId on ID=0. Since 0 is
an invalid ID Windows NT Services for Macintosh returned ParamErr.

RESOLUTION
==========

The error code was changed to be IdNotFound which is what is returned from real
AppleShare servers.

======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Windows NT Server version 3.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest
U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.5. For information on obtaining the
