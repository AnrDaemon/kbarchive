TITLE   :WINMIF Fails If XNF File Has Text Before Numeric Fields
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbConfig smsconfig

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a MIF form (XNF file), such as the example below, the form fails
when a client enters the number field. If numbers are inserted into the text
field, the data entry continues without problems.

Example
-------

Item                Type    Length/Default    Storage
first name          txt         20            specific
last name           txt         20            common
phone number        txt         20            common
organization        txt         40            common
department          txt         50            common
manager             txt         30            common
mail station        txt          9            common
monitor bar code    number       0            common
Computer bar code   number       0            common

WORKAROUND
==========

If the form is altered such that the number fields are first, then the data
entry continues.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.0. This problem was corrected in Systems Management Server version
1.1.
