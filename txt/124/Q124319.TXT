BUG# QJET: 1800 (2.00.2317)

SYMPTOMS
========

When using table names qualified with the current qualifier and using identifier
quote character to enclose the current qualifier and the table name, you receive
a syntax error. This happens with dBASE, Paradox, Microsoft FoxPro, Btrieve,
Microsoft Excel, and Text Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) drivers. It does NOT
happen with the Microsoft Access driver.

For example, in case of dBase driver, if the values returned by
SQLGetConnectOption and SQLGetInfo are as shown:

 SQLGetConnectOption(hdbc,SQL_CURRENT_QUALIFIER,pvParam)
      Returns "C:\Database"
 SQLGetInfo(hdbc, SQL_IDENTIFIER_QUOTE_CHAR, rgbInfoValue,cbInfoValueMax)
      Returns "`"
 SQLGetInfo(hdbc, SQL_QUALIFIER_NAME_SEPARATOR,rgbInfoValue,cbInfoValueMax)
      Returns "\"

Then you let a table called testtable exist in the data source. The queries of
the form below will receive syntax error SQLState=37000, szErrorMsg=,

   Syntax error in FROM clause

when executed using SQLExecDirect or SQLExecute calls.

      Select * from 'C:\Database'\'testtable'
      delete from 'C:\Database'\'testtable'
      Update 'C:\Database'\'testtable' set <colname>=<new value>

If you do not use the quote character around the qualifier and the table, these
queries work fine.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you do not use the quote character around the qualifier and the table name,
the queries work correctly and do not return errors.

Alternately, instead of using the backward slash (\) as a separator, if you use a
period (.), which is the separator in the Microsoft Access ODBC driver, the
queries work fine with the qualifier and table name enclosed in the quote
character.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in ODBC DeskTop Database Drivers
Pack version 2.00.2317. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
