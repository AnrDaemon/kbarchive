TITLE   :ARP Static Cache Entries Switch to Dynamic
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5; :3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If a static ARP (address resolution protocol) cache entry is added (for example,
ARP -s inet_addr eth_addr) it occasionally switches to dynamic. Unfortunately,
dynamic entries are deleted after two minutes of dormancy.

CAUSE
=====

Whenever ARP receives an ARP request for itself, it updates its ARP cache with
the information of the requestor. It does this without respect to the type of an
existing entry.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
