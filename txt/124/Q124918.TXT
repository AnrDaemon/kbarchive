-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a domain name service (DNS) to resolve NetBIOS names, failures
occur if the name being resolved is an alias or "CNAME."

CAUSE
=====

VNBT.386 is not correctly parsing DNS responses that contain multiple answer
sections. This can cause unexpected behavior as text in the second answer
section may be interpreted as an IP address.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in TCP/IP-32 for Windows for
Workgroups versions 3.11 and 3.11a. This problem was corrected in TCP/IP-32
for Windows for Workgroups version 3.11b.

TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups version 3.11b is available on the
Windows NT 3.51 compact disc.
