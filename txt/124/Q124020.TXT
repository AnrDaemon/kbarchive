PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER::1.0,1.1; WINDOWS:1.0

KEYWORDS:

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Multimedia Stravinsky, The Rite of Spring, version 1.0

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a 256-color bitmap displayed as your backdrop in Windows, you may
find that areas of it become blacked out or change color after you have opened
and closed a secondary window in any of the composer titles listed at the top of
this article. For example, after you close Help, the Glossary, the Game Entry
form, or the Find dialog box in Schubert, you may find that the area of the
bitmap that was underneath the dialog box looks strange or is black.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the composer titles listed at the
top of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
