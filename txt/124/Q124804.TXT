SUMMARY
=======

If you use the VOLINFO utility from a Novell NetWare 3.12 server to view
information on a Windows 95 system configured with file and printer sharing for
NetWare Networks, the Free Directories entry is incorrect. VOLINFO states that
32,767 directory entries are allocated to the volume. It also states that the
number of free directory entries is 32,767.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Available Directory Entries and Total Directory Entries are fields that have
meaning on actual Novell NetWare servers (the space for directory names is
preallocated when the volume is formatted), but they do not have meaning on
Windows 95 (VFAT or CDFS) volumes. To provide compatibility with applications
that check to see if space is available to create new directories, Windows 95
returns the maximum allowable value for these fields, 32,767.
