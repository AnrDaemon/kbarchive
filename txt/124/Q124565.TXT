TITLE   :TCP/IP-32 Leaves Names in the NetBIOS Name Table
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER::3.11; WINDOWS:3.11

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Some NetBIOS applications run only once if they use NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT).
To run the application a second time, you have to quit Windows for Workgroups
and then restart it.

CAUSE
=====

Most NetBIOS applications register a unique NetBIOS name when they start. If
datagrams are sent to this NetBIOS name prior to establishing a session with
this name, the reference count on the name may be incremented. The only time the
reference count should be incremented is when a session is established using
this name. When the application terminates, it attempts to delete the name. This
decrements the reference count by one. If the reference count is not reduced to
zero, the name is not deleted. The next time the application is run, it
encounters an error when it attempts to register the unique name.

WORKAROUND
==========

Currently, you can work around this problem only by quitting and restarting
Windows for Workgroups.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in TCP/IP-32 for Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11a. A fix to this problem is in development, but has not
been regression-tested and may be destabilizing in production environments.
Microsoft does not recommend implementing this fix at this time. Contact
Microsoft Product Support Services for more information on the availability of
this fix.
