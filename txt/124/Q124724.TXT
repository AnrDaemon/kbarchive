SYMPTOMS
========

When you print images from Microsoft Encarta to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet
4M or 4ML printer, the printed output is distorted or garbled. The printed image
is the right size and shape, but is not recognizable.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if you are using version 3.57 or earlier of the HP 4M/4ML
(PostScript) printer driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, use any one of the following methods:

 - Upgrade to version 4.0 or later of the HP LaserJet 4M/4ML printer driver. You
   can obtain the latest version of this driver as a self- extracting file
   called HPCL5E.EXE on the Hewlett-Packard forum (GO HPPER) on CompuServe, or
   contact Hewlett-Packard.

 - Use the HP LaserJet III printer driver instead of the 4M/4ML printer driver.

 - Copy the image from Encarta and paste it into another program (such as Write
   or Paintbrush). Print the image from the second program.
