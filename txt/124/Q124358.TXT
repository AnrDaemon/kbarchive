TITLE   :RAS Server Assigns Cached IP Addresses to RAS Clients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Windows NT version 3.5 or 3.51 Remote Access Service (RAS) server uses
dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) servers to assign remote TCP/IP
client addresses, the range of IP addresses that the RAS server receives is
cached in the registry. If you reconfigure the DHCP server to allocate and
provide IP addresses from a different address pool, the RAS server still assigns
IP addresses from the original RAS client address pool.

CAUSE
=====

The RAS Server does not query the DHCP server for new IP addresses until the
original address leases (cached in the Registry) expire.

RESOLUTION
==========

To force the RAS server to use the new IP addresses provided by the DHCP
server:

   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
   problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
   Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
   Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

   \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RemoteAccess\Parameters\Ip

3. Remove the DhcpAddresses subkey.

4. Close Registry Editor.

5. Shutdown and restart Windows NT.
