TITLE   :FFAPI: Corrupted From: Field with Large Gateway Put
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit (FFAPI), version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the LGTWPUT.EXE program, a corrupted From: field may result.

CAUSE
=====

This corruption occurs if you run EDIT.COM before you run LGTWPUT.EXE.

LGTWPUT.EXE is inheriting some bits that EDIT leaves in memory, and this triggers
corruption in the MAI and P1 files. The From: field becomes corrupted. Once the
error occurs, all subsequent mail reflects the same error condition.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail
Software Development Kit (SDK): File Format Application Programming Interface
(FFAPI) for Applications and Gateways. This problem was corrected in LGTWPUT.EXE
version 3.04.7. If you do not have version 3.04.7 (or later), you can download
GWPUT.EXE, a self-extracting file, on the following services:
