TITLE   :Trumpet PPP Client Can Hang RAS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Trumpet WinSock Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) client that connects to Windows
NT Server version 3.5 Remote Access Service (RAS) can cause RAS to stop
responding (hang) if the client doesn't log off gracefully using the Trumpet
logoff script.

CAUSE
=====

The Trumpet WinSock PPP client sends a password authentication protocol (PAP)
packet to establish a new connection on an established connection. Windows NT
Server version 3.5 RAS does not handle this condition properly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in the latest US Service Pack for Windows NT. For
