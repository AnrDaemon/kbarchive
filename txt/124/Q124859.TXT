SUMMARY
=======

Due to Windows NT C2 security limitations, by default, you cannot grant someone
without administrator rights the right to submit jobs to the Schedule service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To give a member of the Server Operators group the right to submit jobs to the
Schedule service do the following:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

   \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa

3. From the Edit menu choose Add Value.

4. Add the following:

      Value Name:   SubmitControl
      Data Type:    REG_DWORD
      Data:         00000001
      Radix:        Hex

In order to make Backup Operators or other "non-Administrator" users able to run
the AT Scheduler service, you must add their user account to the appropriate
user group.

On a Domain Controller, they must be added to the Server Operators group. Then
follow the steps above.

On a member server or a stand-alone server, they must be added to the local
Administrators group.
