SUMMARY
=======

When you install Microsoft Mail for PC Networks on an OS/2 workstation, the
following error message may appear:

   SYS1804: Setup is unable to find file KEYBOARD.

To avoid this problem, run Setup within a WINOS/2 session.

Depending upon the version OS/2 being used, mail is installed on the OS/2 client
machine with either PMSETUP.EXE or SETUP.EXE. PMSETUP.EXE was specifically
designed to be used with Presentation Manager version 1.x. On any version of
OS/2 later than 1.x, you must use the Windows SETUP.EXE program.

The problem generally arises when the customer is attempting to use SETUP.EXE
within an OS/2 session. In order for SETUP.EXE to perform correctly, the user
must run setup within a WINOS/2 session.
