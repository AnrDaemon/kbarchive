SUMMARY
=======

When you try to log on to a Microsoft Windows NT or Microsoft LAN Manager domain
through Windows for Workgroups, the following error message may appear:

   No domain server was available to validate your password. You were logged on
   without password validation.

Even though you receive this error, you may still be able to gain access to
Windows NT and LAN Manager resources.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are a variety of reasons for receiving the above error (such as
incompatible protocols being used, improper configuration of the domain name
under Windows for Workgroups, and so forth). Some of these causes do not result
in the inability to connect to Windows NT and LAN Manager resources.


If you have the appropriate permissions through your user ID and password
combination and the server is online and accessible, you can continue to use
Windows for Workgroups and connect to LAN Manager and Windows NT resources, even
after receiving this error. That is, your access to Windows NT and LAN Manager
servers is based on the access rights assigned to your user ID and password
combination at the server being accessed, not by the success or failure of your
initial logon.

For additional information about logon validation and reasons for the above
error, search for the following key words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.
