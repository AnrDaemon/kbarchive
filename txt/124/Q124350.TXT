TITLE   :WFWG Err Msg: The API Return Buffer Is Too Small
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to create a password list for the first time, or try to create a
password list for a new user, the following error message may be displayed:

   The API return buffer is too small

CAUSE
=====

This error message is displayed when a forward slash is included in the Windows
portion of the path statement (that is, the path reads C:/<WINDOWS
DIRECTORY> instead of C:\<WINDOWS DIRECTORY>). This error message may
also occur if there is a missing slash in the windows path.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this error message, change the forward slash in the path entry to a
backslash. To do this, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt:

   edit autoexec.bat

After you make the change save and close the file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows starts correctly in this situation because MS-DOS can use either slash
mark; however, you cannot set up applications, and applications that rely on the
Windows entry in the path statement do not function correctly. For example, if
you try to run Windows Setup or Network Setup, you receive the error message

   You are attempting to set up Windows from within Windows. Quit Windows and
   type 'setup' at the MS-DOS command prompt.
