SYMPTOMS
========

Images in Encarta appear blurred and grainy if your screen is set to display
images in 16 shades of gray; however, in the Finder, these same images look
clearer. For example, in the article that discusses Roh Te Woo, note that the
picture is blurred and grainy. However, if you switch to the Finder, the picture
of Roh Te Woo is clearer.

CAUSE
=====

Encarta is designed to run best in 256 colors or shades of gray. In fact, when
you first start Encarta, it will recommend that you display images in 256
colors. The quality of images at resolutions fewer than 256 colors are not very
clear.

RESOLUTION
==========

To switch to 256 colors or shades of gray, choose Control Panels from the Apple
menu, and choose the Monitors control panel. (Note that you must have a monitor
that is capable of displaying 256 colors for this option to be available.)

MORE INFORMATION
================

If your computer is displaying images in 16 shades of gray, Encarta changes the
palette by adding an extra shade of black.

This problem was corrected in Encarta 1995.
