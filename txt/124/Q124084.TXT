TITLE   :FTP OnNet 1.1 PPP Client Hangs Windows NT 3.5 RAS Service
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using FTP's OnNet version 1.1 software on Windows for Workgroups 3.11 as a
dial-in PPP client to a Windows NT version 3.5 RAS server, the hangup script
used can cause the RAS services on the server to stop responding (hang).
Additionally, an unexpected disconnect, such as turning off the modem can also
cause the RAS service to hang. Event Viewer shows event ID 20077 from source
RemoteAccess. Attempts to restart the RAS service will cause event ID 7024 -
service specific error 1066.

In order to start the RAS service, the server must be rebooted.

NOTE: This problem also occurs if the client PPP product uses a Trumpet Winsock.


STATUS
======

problem was corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version
3.5. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
