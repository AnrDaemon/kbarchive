TITLE   :Real Mode Redir Domain Validation Err Msg: Access Denied
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.0,3.11,3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Computers running the Windows for Workgroups, Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS, or
Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS with the real mode redirector direct hosting
over IPX may fail to be validated by a domain controller and display an access
denied error message. The computer may not be able to connect to network
drives.

This problem occurs when you are using either Microsoft NWLINK.EXE or Novell's
IPX protocols but only over Token Ring. The problem also occurs when you use the
updated redirector (NET.EXE) available from the CLIENT directory on the Windows
NT Server version 3.5 CD.

NOTE: Under Windows NT 3.5, a new feature, direct hosting, was added to improve
performance. This enables a Windows for Workgroups client to communicate
directly with the server over IPX/SPX, rather than over NetBIOS.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups version
3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, add the following line to the [network] section of
the SYSTEM.INI file:

   USELISTENECBS=YES
