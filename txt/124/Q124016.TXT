SYMPTOMS
========

After starting Encarta, the Microsoft Home dialog box displays and the system
stops responding (hangs). Pressing CTRL+ESC displays the Task List with Create
Note as a running application.

CAUSE
=====

This error will occur when one of the following happens:

1. You map a directory to a drive using the MS-DOS SUBST command. For example,
   the following command in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file may cause Encarta to stop
   responding (hang) at the Home screen:

      subst x: c:\apps\windows

   This command will create a drive X mapping to the C:\APPS\WINDOWS directory.

2. Windows is installed to the root directory or is mapped to a root directory
   either using the SUBST command, a shell, or even a network situation using a
   map.

   To determine your Windows location:

   a. Shell to the MS-DOS prompt (double-click the MS-DOS Prompt icon in the
      Main group of Program Manager).

   b. Type Set at the prompt.

   If the WINDIR= line is set to WINDIR=C: or another drive, you have an invalid
   directory path. It should say something like:

      WINDIR=C:\WINDOWS

3. A corrupted ENCART94.ANN file (in Encarta 1994) and a corrupted ENCART95.ANN
   file (in Encarta 1995) can also cause the problem. The ENCART94.ANN and
   ENCART95.ANN files are created for annotations. Delete this file.

4. Your fonts are corrupt. Delete the V<#>SP.FON (where <#> is a
   number between 1 and 7) from your Windows SYSTEM subdirectory. Then, rerun
   Setup from the Encarta CD.
