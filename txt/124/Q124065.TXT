======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to install the Windows for Workgroups (WFW) Mail client, the
following error message appears:

   There is not a valid workgroup postoffice at the network path you entered.

This message is displayed when you attempt to connect to an existing postoffice
located on a PC-NFS server.

CAUSE
=====

The Mail Setup dialog box does not accept universal naming convention (UNC)
paths or mapped network drives. For example, you could not use either of the
following paths:

   \\server_name\share_name\wgpo

   -or-

   <drive>:\wgpo

where <drive> is the letter of a network drive you connected to in File
Manager.


RESOLUTION
==========

Use the following procedure to resolve this problem:

1. Connect to the PC-NFS server using File Manager. This will establish a
   connection to the existing post office using a mapped drive letter.

2. Edit the MSMAIL.INI file using a text editor, such as Notepad. Change or add
   the following line in the [Microsoft Mail] section:

   "ServerPath=<drive>:\WGPO" (without the quotation marks)

   where <drive> is the letter of the mapped drive you created in Step 1.

   If no MSMAIL.INI file exists, one can be created in the WINDOWS directory with
   these entries:

   [Microsoft Mail]
   WG=1
   ServerPath=<drive>:\WGPO

3. Start Mail.

4. Choose Yes when asked:

   Do you have an account on the postoffice <drive>:\WGPO?
