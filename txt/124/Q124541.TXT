KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To upgrade a single-processor system to a multiprocessor system, use Uptomp.exe.
Uptomp.exe is included in the Resource Kit for Windows NT version 3.5. This tool
is located under Performance and System Monitoring Tools in Resource Kit Tools
Help.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The following list contains the computer models that appear in the Uptomp.exe
tool and the associated HAL files included in Windows NT.

Note that the latest versions of these files are included in the Windows NT
Service Packs. If you have installed a Service Pack, you should use the
appropriate file from the Service Pack.

   halast.dll    = "AST Manhattan SMP"
   halsp.dll     = "Compaq SystemPro Multiprocessor or 100% Compatible"
   halcbus.dll   = "Corollary C-bus Architecture"
   halmca.dll    = "IBM PS/2 or other Micro Channel-based PC"
   halapic.dll   = "MPS Uniprocessor PC"
   halmps.dll    = "MPS Multiprocessor PC"
   halncr.dll    = "NCR System 3000 Model 3360/3450/3550"
   haloli        = "Olivetti LSX5030/40"
   hal.dll       = "Standard PC"
   hal486c.dll   = "Standard PC with C-Step i486"
   halwyse7.dll  = "Wyse Series 7000i Model 740MP/760MP"

After Uptomp finishes, you see a dialog box informing you that the upgrade was
successful, the system needs to be restarted for this change to take effect, and
that you should run Rdisk after the system restarts to update the saved
configuration. It is very important to click the "Update Repair Info" option in
Rdisk before you click "Create Repair Disk."

NOTE: If you are changing to or from single or multiple processors and you are
using Microsoft Proxy 2.0 server on the same computer, you also need to replace
the Ipfltdrv.sys driver (%systemroot%\system32\drivers). The single-processor
version is 36 KB and is located on the Proxy 2.0 CD-ROM in the
Msproxy\I386\Routing\Up folder. The multiple-processor version is 34 KB and is
located on the Proxy 2.0 CD-ROM in the Msproxy\I386\Routing folder.
