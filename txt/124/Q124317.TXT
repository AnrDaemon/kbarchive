SUMMARY
=======

Using Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) version 2.0 Microsoft Access driver when
you call SQLColAttribute for fDescType=SQL_COLUMN_LABEL for a result set column
that is a column in a table, the returned value is the field or column name and
not the field description that might have been added to the table in Microsoft
Access version 2.0.


MORE INFORMATION
================

In Microsoft Access version 2.0 during a table design, a field description can
be added for a column. However, when a query is executed that has a result set
with that column, SQLColAttribute with fDescType equal to SQL_COLUMN_LABEL for
that column returns column name as the label and not the field description.
