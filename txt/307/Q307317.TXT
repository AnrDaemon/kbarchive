SYMPTOMS

When you use Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) Message Queue Information Service
(MQIS) servers that run Windows NT 4.0, clients that run Microsoft Windows XP or

(ACLs) and cannot update their own properties when they are connected with an
MQIS server.

NOTE: Windows XP clients can use MQIS servers that run Windows NT 4.0 only in a
Windows NT 4.0-based domain.
