======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) or Common Programming
Interface for Communications (CPI-C) applications may be unable to allocate LU
6.2 sessions. This typically occurs after the applications have been functioning
normally for a long period of time.

This problem only occurs if the SNA Server or Host Integration Server (HIS) 2000
systems are using dynamic remote APPC logical units (LUs) for communications
with the host system.

The exact symptoms experienced by the end users of the APPC or CPI-C applications
may vary depending on the application, but the following errors are likely to be
returned by the underlying SNA Server/HIS 2000 APPC and CPI-C APIs.

APPC

   Primary Return Code: 0003 (AP_ALLOCATION_ERROR)

   Secondary Return Code: 00000005 (AP_ALLOCATION_FAILURE_RETRY)

CPI-C

   Error 20 (CM_PRODUCT_SPECIFIC_ERROR)

   -or-

   Error 24 (CM_PROGRAM_PARAMETER_CHECK)

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server service can get into a state where the internal configuration
table that is used to track all APPC conversations has no more free entries.
This in turn leads to the APPC or CPI-C allocation failures.

It has been determined that under certain circumstances, the SNA Server service
fails to clean up entries for APPC conversations involving Dynamic Remote APPC
LUs, which can eventually cause the internal configuration table to become full.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server
----------

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
