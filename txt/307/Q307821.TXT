TITLE   :Permissions Lost When Shared Folders Service Is Restarted
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Any share permissions set through Windows Explorer on a drive that is mapped to
an AS/400 shared folder by using the Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000
(HIS) Shared Folders Service are lost when the Shared Folders Service is
restarted.

CAUSE
=====

The Shared Folders Service deletes all AS/400 shared folder drive mappings when
the Service is stopped and recreates the AS/400 shared folder drive mappings
when the service is started. When the drive mappings are recreated, the Shared
Folders Service sets the permissions from information that it previously
stored.

When share permissions are set through the Folder Definition dialog box in SNA
Manager, the Shared Folders Service stores these permissions for future use.

When share permissions are set through Windows Explorer, Shared Folders is unable
to detect those changes and does not store the new permissions for future use.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000.
