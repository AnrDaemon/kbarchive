SUMMARY

This article contains comments, corrections, and information about known errors
relating to the Microsoft Press book Microsoft Windows 2000 and IIS 5.0

MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 46: Incorrect IP Address In Figure 3-3
-------------------------------------------

On page 46, in Figure 3-3, all three sites should have the same IP address,
instead of three different IP addresses.

Change both:
"10.0.0.85" and "10.0.0.102"

To:
"10.0.0.52"


Page 63: Incorrect Text For "Deleting Files"
--------------------------------------------

On page 63, the text under "Deleting Files" is an exact duplicate of the text
under "Deleting Directories" on page 62.

Replace the text under "Deleting Files" with the following correct text:

"Deleting Files

You can delete files using Windows Explorer or the Internet Information Services
snap-in. In Windows Explorer, you can select files to delete using their
physical directory location. In the snap-in you can follow the virtual directory
structure to find files you want to delete, which is useful if you know you have
to delete a file at a specific URL. The file description in the snap-in can also
tell you if a file is redirected and in which case, you may not want to delete
the file.

To delete a file in the Internet Information Services snap-in, follow these
steps:

1. In the Internet Information Services snap-in, click the plus sign (+) next to
   the Web site you want to work with.

2. Right-click the file you want to delete and then select Delete. When asked to
   confirm the action, click OK."
