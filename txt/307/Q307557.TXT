TITLE   :BUG: 32-Bit App. Use of DBGrid Fails When 16-Bit Already Running
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 98 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You have Dbgrid16.ocx and Dbgrid32.ocx controls on your Windows 95 or Windows
98-based system that are in use by two different applications. One application
uses the 16-bit control (Dbgrid16.ocx) and another application uses the 32-bit
control (Dbgrid32.ocx). If you start the 16-bit application and then try to
start the 32-bit application, the 32-bit application fails and returns the
following error message:

   Component 'DBGRID32.OCX' or one of its dependencies not correctly registered:
   a file is missing or invalid.

The problem does not happen if you run these applications on Windows NT 4.0,
Windows 2000, or Windows XP. Also, it does not happen if you start the 32-bit
application first and then start the 16-bit application.
