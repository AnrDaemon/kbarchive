TITLE   :SMS: SMS 2.0 English-Language Client Support on Non-English OS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft supports for a System Management Server (SMS) 2.0 English-language
client that runs on a non-English operating system. You can have this
combination if the following conditions are met:

 - The SQL Server code page is ANSI 1252 for the SMS site database.

 - The AutomaticAnsiToOEM option is turned off.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The non-English SMS 2.0 server languages include both the localized language
client and the U.S. English-language client. For example, an SMS 2.0 Japanese
site server can install either Japanese or English-language SMS clients. If the
client's language is not recognized when it is installed, the English-language
client is installed. Microsoft supports this configuration.

For example, if a Chinese operating system tries to install an SMS client from a
Japanese SMS site server, the English-language client is installed and supported
on the Chinese computer.

If you use SQL Server 7.0 Japanese for the SMS site database, you must install
the SQL Server with following settings:

   Character Set : 1252/ISO changed from 932 (Japanese SQL Server default
   setting)
   Sort Order : Dictionary order, case-insensitive
   Unicode Collation - Locale Identifier : General Unicode

After the SQL server installs, turn off the AutomaticAnsiToOEM option.

For more information about the SQL Server and the other versions, please see the
SQL Server manual or contact Microsoft Product Support Services.
