SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to call the AirportWeather Web service
by using Visual FoxPro 7.0.

How to Call the AirportWeather Web Service
------------------------------------------

Visual FoxPro 7.0 contains several features that make working with Web services
easier, including IntelliSense and a FoxPro Foundation Class to simplify working
with the SOAP toolkit.

AirportWeather is a service that looks up the current weather at any NOAA airport
observation post. This code sample displays a message box with the current
weather conditions at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.

NOTE: To call Web services in Visual FoxPro 7.0, you must have the Microsoft SOAP
Toolkit version 2.0 installed. You can install the SOAP Toolkit from the Visual
FoxPro 7.0 installation CD or by downloading it from the following Microsoft
Developer Network (MSDN) Web site:

   Microsoft SOAP Toolkit
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/default.asp?URL=/code/sample.asp?url=/msdn-files/027/001/580/msdncompositedoc.xml

The client parts of the SOAP Toolkit come preinstalled on Microsoft Windows XP,
so you don't need a separate download.


If you are behind a firewall, you may have problems running this code.

Find the AirportWeather Web Service:

1. Browse to the following Web site:

   XMethods.com
   http://xmethods.com/

2. Scroll down to the AirportWeather service name (owned by Cape Clear).

3. Click the service name to browse to the following Web site:

   http://xmethods.com/detail.html?id=129

4. Click the WSDL URL, to see the formal definition of the Web service at the
   following Web site:

   http://www.capescience.com/webservices/airportweather/AirportWeather.wsdl

   For help with the other features of the service, see the following Web site:

   http://www.capescience.com/webservices/airportweather/index.html

5. Copy the WSDL URL onto the clipboard.

Call the AirportWeather Web Service:

1. In Visual FoxPro 7.0, start the IntelliSense Manager from the Tools menu.

2. On the Types tab, click Web Services. Note that you receive an error message
   if you do not have SOAP version 2.0 or later installed. You also receive a
   warning if you do not have Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS)
   installed, but you can continue.

3. For Web Service Name, type "AirportWeather" (without the quotation marks).

4. For WDSL URL Location, paste the WSDL URL that you copied in step 5 of the
   previous section
   (http://www.capescience.com/webservices/airportweather/AirportWeather.wsdl).

5. Click Register, and the Web service information is saved in the IntelliSense
   FoxCode.dbf table.

6. Create a new program (for example, Aw.prg).

7. In the code window, type "LOCAL loAW AS AirportWeather" (without the
   quotation marks). Note that AirportWeather is included in the list of types
   that IntelliSense displays.

8. Press ENTER. IntelliSense fills in the following code:

   LOCAL loWS
   loWS = NEWOBJECT("Wsclient",HOME()+"ffc\_webservices.vcx")
   loWS.cWSName = "AirportWeather"
   loAw = loWS.SetupClient("http://live.capescience.com/wsdl/AirportWeather.wsdl", "AirportWeather", "Station")

9. Paste the following code at the end of the program:

   LOCAL loAW as AirportWeather
    LOCAL loWS
    loWS = NEWOBJECT("Wsclient",HOME()+"ffc\_webservices.vcx")
    loWS.cWSName = "AirportWeather"
    loAW = loWS.SetupClient("http://live.capescience.com/wsdl/AirportWeather.wsdl", "AirportWeather", "Station")
    loAW.ConnectorProperty("Timeout") = 60 * 1000 && milliseconds
    LOCAL loSummary, lcMessage
    loSummary = loAW.getSummary("KSEA")
    WITH loSummary
    TEXT TO lcMessage NOSHOW
    Location: <<.Item(1).Text>>
    Wind: <<.Item(2).Text>>
   Sky Conditions: <<.Item(3).Text>>
    Temperature: <<.Item(4).Text>>
    Humidity: <<.Item(5).Text>>
    Barometer: <<.Item(6).Text>>
    Visibility: <<.Item(7).Text>>
    ENDTEXT
    
    MESSAGEBOX(TEXTMERGE(lcMessage), "KSEA Weather Conditions") 
   ENDWITH

Note that after you type "loAW." (without the quotation marks), IntelliSense
displays the various methods of the Web service. After you select getSummary,
IntelliSense displays a tooltip with its parameters and return value. Note that
it returns a value of type WeatherSummary:. This is a complex type that is
parsed into a COM object with the SOAP Toolkit.

The AirportWeather service has other methods that return simple strings, which
can be displayed normally.

10. Run the program.

service, so if necessary, choose another one to test against, and modify the
display code accordingly.
