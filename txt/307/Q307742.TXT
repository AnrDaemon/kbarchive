TITLE   :Exchange SDK HrCreateDirEntryID Does Not Work w/Outlook 2002
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Software Development Kit (SDK) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The call to the HrCreateDirEntryID function in the Exchange SDK March 2001 or
earlier no longer works correctly after you upgrade to Microsoft Outlook 2002.
This call works if you are using Microsoft Outlook 2000.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because of a problem in the Exchange SDK. In HrSearchGAL,
in Edkutils\Edkutils.c, the following call is incorrect:

       hr = MAPICALL(lpAdrBook)->OpenEntry(
   		        lpAdrBook, 
   		        cbGALEntryID, 
   		        lpGALEntryID, 
   		        &IID_IMAPIContainer, 
   		        MAPI_BEST_ACCESS | MAPI_DEFERRED_ERRORS, 
   		        &ulGALObjectType, 
   		        (LPUNKNOWN *) &lpGAL);

The problem is that the IID that is requested is IID_IMAPIContainer, but the code
treats the returned interface pointer as a pointer to an IABContainer interface.
(IABContainer is derived from IMAPIContainer.) In Outlook 2000, the interface
that is returned from the OpenEntry call is an IABContainer interface, which
works. In Outlook 2002, the interface that is returned is actually an
IMAPIContainer interface, not an IABContainer interface. Therefore, when the
code later tries to call IABContainer::ResolveNames, the vtable entry is not
present, and the application stops unexpectedly (crashes).

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the IID_IMAPIContainer to IID_IABContainer in the following call:

       hr = MAPICALL(lpAdrBook)->OpenEntry(
   		        lpAdrBook, 
   		        cbGALEntryID, 
   		        lpGALEntryID, 
   		        &IID_IMAPIContainer, 
   		        MAPI_BEST_ACCESS | MAPI_DEFERRED_ERRORS, 
   		        &ulGALObjectType, 
   		        (LPUNKNOWN *) &lpGAL);

The Exchange SDK includes full source code, so it is possible to fix the call.
After you fix the call, you must perform a full rebuild of the Exchange SDK
library.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.
