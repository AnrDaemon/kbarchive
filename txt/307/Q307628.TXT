SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to configure the Internet Mail Service in Exchange
Server 5.5 to reroute Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) messages for multiple
e-mail domains by using a single SMTP proxy address.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Exchange Server 5.5 Internet Mail Service can rewrite the SMTP headers of
e-mail messages so that you can reroute an e-mail message that is sent to a
recipient by using the e-mail address <user>@<domain>.com to another
SMTP address <user>2@<domain>2.com without configuring this
destination recipient with both SMTP proxy addresses. This article describes a
method to accomplish this in which the mailbox in Exchange Server 5.5 only needs
the primary SMTP address on the mailbox.

Exchange Server 5.5 to route SMTP messages for multiple domains by adding
secondary SMTP proxy addresses to each mailbox, click the article number below

   Q264557 XFOR: Configuring the Internet Mail Service to Route SMTP Messages
   for Multiple Domains

In Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server, the functionality to reroute SMTP messages for
multiple e-mail domains by using a single SMTP proxy address (which this article
describes) does not exist. In Exchange 2000, if you either use recipient
policies or add one address at a time to the individual mailbox, you must still
configure the user with all of the SMTP proxy addresses that you want the user
to receive e-mail messages for.

In Exchange Server 5.5, users on your Exchange Server 5.5 computer might have
multiple SMTP e-mail addresses on the Internet; these users have only a single
SMTP e-mail address defined on Exchange Server, but these users need to receive
all of the e-mail that is sent to the users' alternate SMTP addresses on this
same Exchange Server 5.5 computer. You can configure the Internet Mail Service
to route SMTP mail for these multiple e-mail domains to a single e-mail domain.

The mail exchange (MX) records for these other e-mail domains must first be set
up to point to your server before you configure the Internet Mail Service.

To configure the Internet Mail Service on Exchange Server 5.5 to reroute e-mail
messages for multiple e-mail domains to a single e-mail domain, use the
configuration in the following example.

In this example, the Exchange Server organization is adatum.com, and the only
SMTP e-mail address that is defined for a user in this organization is
administrator@adatum.com. However, this user has other valid e-mail addresses on
the Internet that are not defined in Exchange Server: administrator@cpandl.net,
administrator@cpandl.org, and administrator@internal.adatum.com.

To reroute all of the messages that are sent to any of these e-mail addresses to
the administrator@adatum.com address without defining additional SMTP addresses
for the administrator on the administrator's mailbox, in the Internet Mail
Service Configuration properties, click the Routing tab, and then configure
rerouting as follows.

+----------------------------------+
| Sent to             | Route to   | 
+----------------------------------+
| adatum.com          | inbound    | 
+----------------------------------+
| cpandl.net          | adatum.com | 
+----------------------------------+
| cpandl.org          | adatum.com | 
+----------------------------------+
| internal.adatum.com | adatum.com | 
+----------------------------------+

After you change the configuration, send a test message to
administrator@cpandl.net. This message is rerouted to administrator@adatum.com.
Send another test message for both administrator@cpandl.org and
administrator@internal.adatum.com; the message is also rerouted to
adminstrator@adatum.com.

NOTE: You can also use this configuration for communication between Exchange
Server sites by means of the Internet Mail Service and between Exchange Server
organizations by means of the Internet Mail Service.

A limitation of this procedure (and also of the procedure that is described in
Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q264557) is that there can be only one reply
address. When a user replies to a message that was sent to any of the users'
e-mail addresses that are configured in the Internet Mail Service, if the
address is not the primary SMTP address, the reply address is still be placed in
the outgoing mail, not the secondary address that is configured in the Internet
Mail Service.

The method that this article describes to reroute SMTP messages for multiple
e-mail domains by using a single SMTP proxy address is quite different from
routing mail messages on Exchange Server based on e-mail addresses. For

e-mail addresses in Exchange Server 5.5, click the article number below to view
