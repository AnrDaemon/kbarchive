TITLE   :PRB: Error 0x80004005 When You Try to Register a WebClass DLL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbASPObj kbCOMt kbVBp600 kbWebClasses kbGrpDSASP kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use a Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) application (WebClass)
to create a dynamic-link library (DLL) in Visual Basic 6.0, you receive the
following error message when you try to register the DLL:

   DLLRegisterServer in <path to DLL> failed.
   Return Code was: 0x80004005

This error message occurs when you try to register the DLL on a computer other
than the one on which it was created.

CAUSE
=====

The WebClass run-time files must be installed to register a WebClass DLL. This
error occurs if you try to register the DLL on a computer that does not have the
WebClass run-time files installed and registered.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use one of the following methods:

 - The best way to deploy a WebClass is to use the Package and Deployment
   Wizard. The Package and Deployment Wizard packages the dependent WebClass
   run-time DLLs when your WebClass is deployed. For information on how to use
   this tool, see the following Microsoft Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/Mind/0999/faq/faq0999.htm

 - Copy and register the Mswcrun.dll file to the computer on which you are
   trying to register your WebClass DLL.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In Visual Basic 6.0, use the IIS Application Project option to create a
   WebClass.

2. Copy the DLL to a computer that does not have the Mswcrun.dll file.

3. At a command prompt, type "regsvr32 WebClassDllName.dll" (without the
   quotation marks) to register the DLL.
