TITLE   :Startweb.vbs and Stopweb.vbs Fail on NT4.0 with Error 800401E4
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to run Internet Information Services (IIS) Active Directory
Service Interfaces (ADSI) scripts such as Startweb.vbs and Stopweb.vbs on a
remote computer, you may receive one or both of the following error messages:

   error: 800401E4 - unable to open IIS://computer/w3svc/site number

-or-

   error: 1A8 - unable to stop web server IIS://computer/w3svc/site number

CAUSE
=====

This problem has two possible causes:

 - The user that issues the command lacks the necessary permissions on the
   target IIS server.

 - Either the source or the target server has a downlevel ADSI client.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, make sure that the user that issues the command is an
authenticated user on the target computer and has Operator rights for the IIS
Web site. Built-in ADSI security does not allow the Anonymous user to access IIS
objects by running IIS scripts.

If the permissions are correct and attempts to run the scripts still fail, the
problem may be a downlevel ADSI client. An upgrade is available from the
following Microsoft Web site:

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is the correct syntax to control an IIS Web site on a remote
computer:

   cscript scriptname.vbs -c computername -a sitenum

For example, to start the Default Web Site on the SERVER1 computer, open a
command prompt, change to the Winnt\System32\Inetsrv\Adminsamples folder, and
then issue the following command:

   cscript startweb.vbs -c SERVER1 -a 1
