The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Systems Management Server (SMS) version 2.0 Service Pack 4
(SP4), the SMS Site Component Manager service may not run.

This problem may occur after you apply any SMS service pack.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you apply SMS 2.0 SP4 immediately after the initial
installation of the site. After the initial installation, the installation
process may not have finished to the point where the SMS services have been
started.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, start the Site Component Manager service service
manually by using the Services tool in Control Panel. To prevent the problem,
after the initial site installation, wait until all SMS services are started
before you apply a service pack.

SMS services on a primary site include:

   SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER
   SMS_EXECUTIVE
   SMS_SQL_MONITOR

   SMS Services on a Secondary Site include:

   SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER
   SMS_EXECUTIVE

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
