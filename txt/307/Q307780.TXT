TITLE   :INFO: Administrator Changes Not Reflected Until App Restarted
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER::5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSExplorer kbDSupport kbGrpDSSSafe

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you change settings that affect the Visual SourceSafe Explorer in the
Administrator tool, those changes are not reflected until you quit and restart
the Visual SourceSafe Explorer application. For example, a shadow folder is not
updated in response to check-ins unless the Visual SourceSafe Explorer is closed
and reopened after you create the shadow folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Visual SourceSafe Explorer only "reads" the configuration file (SRCSAFE.ini)
when the application is started. If you make changes in the Administrator tool
or to the configuration file itself, the Visual SourceSafe Explorer will not be
aware of these changes until it is restarted and reads the new configuration
file. Some of the functions and settings affected include: shadow folder
settings, allow multiple checkouts, keyword expansion, journaling, Web project
settings, Web settings, and file types.
