TITLE   :CurrentNonAnonymousUsers Counter Change from Zero to Negative
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWin2000PreSP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you configure a Web site to redirect all requests to another Web site, the
CurrentNonAnonymousUsers performance counter value of this Web site may increase
significantly.

CAUSE
=====

The default setting of the W3SVC/AuthPersistence property is
AuthSingleRequestIfProxy(0x80). An HTTP request from a proxy server causes the
CurrentNonAnonymousUsers value to decrease, but this counter never increases
because the site is a redirection Web site.

RESOLUTION
==========
