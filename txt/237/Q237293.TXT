TITLE   :XADM: Owner Field Blank in Distribution List Properties
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you view the properties of a distribution list from the Microsoft Outlook
client, the Owner field is blank. However, if you view the properties of the
distribution list from the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, the
Owner field is populated.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by design. The owner of the distribution list has been hidden
from the global address list.

The owner of a distribution list must be in the same site as the distribution
list. You can assign a mailbox to manage a distribution list; create a "dummy"
mailbox in the site where the distribution list is located and assign owner
rights to this mailbox. Then hide this mailbox from the global address list so
that the user only has one valid mailbox in the global address list.
