Then run the Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 Application Compatibility script.
The Msie40.cmd file is located in %SystemRoot%\Application Compatibility

After the script is complete, return to Execute mode by typing the following at a
command prompt:

   "change user /execute" (without the quotation marks)
