TITLE   :Err Msg: "You Do Not Have Permission to Modify This Print Job"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to delete a print job from a Windows 95/98 client and the print
queue resides on a Windows NT Server-based computer, the following error message
may be displayed:

   You Do Not Have Permission to Modify This Print Job

This error message is displayed even if you are the owner of the print job, and
have Full Control permissions to manage documents.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because of a latency between the time the job actually
leaves the server, and the time that the client queue refreshes. The print job
no longer resides on the server; it is already spooled out to the printer and is
in the printer's memory.
