======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, if you perform a mail merge with a data source
saved as a dBase (*.dbf) file, and you select a dBase format converter [for
example: FoxPro Files via ODBC (*.dbf)], and you have one or more of the
following installed:

 - Windows NT 4.0 with Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) version 2.1

   -or-

 - Windows 98 Second Edition

   -or-

 - Windows 95 or Windows 98 with MDAC 2.1

   -or-

 - Any other program that updates the Odbcjt32.dll file to version 4.0

The following error message may appear:

   Cannot Find Installable ISAM

CAUSE
=====

The operating systems listed in the "Symptoms" section of this article all
install Odbcjt32.dll version 4.0, which does not support installable ISAM
(indexed sequential access method).

WORKAROUND
==========

NOTE: This workaround details specifically using the FoxPro ODBC converters.
However, these steps should correct the problems described in the "Symptoms"
section of this article regardless of the source of the dBase (*.dbf) file you
are using.


To work around this problem, you need to do all of the following:

1. To ensure that you are using Visual FoxPro ODBC driver (Vfpodbc.dll) version
   6.0 or later, download and install Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC)
   version 2.1 or later.

   NOTE: If you already have installed MDAC 2.1 or later, proceed to the next two
   steps, "Download and install Wdvfpdsn.exe" and "Attach or re-attach the
   FoxPro data source in Word".

   -and-

2. Download and install the Wdvfpdsn.exe file from the Microsoft Download
   Center.

   -and-

3. Attach or re-attach the FoxPro data source in Word.

Ensure That You Are Using Vfpodbc.dll Version 6.0 or Later
----------------------------------------------------------

Download and install MDAC 2.1 from the following Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/Data/MDAC21info/MDAC21sp2manifest.htm
   (http://www.microsoft.com/Data/MDAC21info/MDAC21sp2manifest.htm)

Or click here:

   http://www.microsoft.com/data/download.htm
   (http://www.microsoft.com/data/download.htm)

When MDAC 2.1 is installed, it does not create the necessary registry entries for
Word to use it. To correctly allow Word to use the Visual FoxPro ODBC driver
during a mail merge, follow the steps in the next section, "Downloading and
Installing the Wdvfpdsn.exe File."

Download and Install the Wdvfpdsn.exe File
------------------------------------------

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

   Wdvfpdsn.exe
   (http://download.microsoft.com/download/word97win/driver/1/WIN98/EN-US/Wdvfpdsn.exe)

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

Attach or Re-attach the Data Source
-----------------------------------

1. In Microsoft Word, open the mail merge main document, and attach or re-attach
   the data source by clicking Mail Merge on the Tools menu and then clicking
   Get Data.

2. After you select the Microsoft FoxPro files in the Open Data Source dialog
   box, make sure to select the Select method check box. Click Open.

3. In the Confirm Data Source dialog box, select "FoxPro Files - Word via ODBC
   (*.dbf)".

NOTE: You still receive the error message if you click on the old driver, "FoxPro
Files via ODBC (*.dbf)". To avoid this, make sure you click the correct driver
with "Word" in the name; for example, FoxPro Files - Word via ODBC (*.dbf).
