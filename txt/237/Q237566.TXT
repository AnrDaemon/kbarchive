TITLE   :%HOMEPATH%, %HOMESHARE%, and %HOMEDRIVE% Resolved Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

One of the features of the Microsoft Distributed File System (Dfs) is to allow
users to map drives directly to folders and subfolders under a Dfs share. If a
user's home folder is on a Dfs share, the %HOMEDRIVE% variable is mapped only to
the Dfs root, and not to the complete path. This behavior is evident when it is
viewed from Windows NT Explorer. In addition, the %HOMEPATH% and %HOMESHARE%
variables are not resolved correctly.

For example, if "Dfs_root" is the DFS root on \\Pkdfs and the user's home folder
is \\Pkdfs\Dfs_root\Home\User1:

   %HOMEDRIVE% (for example, drive Z) is mapped to \\Pkdfs\Dfs_root
   %HOMESHARE% resolves to \\Pkdfs\Dfs_root
   %HOMEPATH% resolves to \Home\User1.

Instead, %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMESHARE% should resolve to \\Pkdfs\Dfs_root\Home\User1,
%HOMEPATH% should resolve to \, and %HOMEDRIVE% (Z:) should map to
\\Pkdfs\Dfs_root\Home\User1.

RESOLUTION
==========
