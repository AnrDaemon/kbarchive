TITLE   :ACC2000:Reverting to Access 97 ODBC Driver After Installing MDAC
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)

KEYWORDS:kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Access 2000 
 - Microsoft Access 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.


NOTE: This operation cannot be performed on Windows Me or Windows 2000 because these systems protect against system file manipulation.

SUMMARY
=======

Installing MDAC version 2.1 or later overwrites the Microsoft Access 97 ODBC
driver with the Access 2000 ODBC driver without warning. For the reasons
documented later in this article, you may want to revert to the Access 97 ODBC
driver. Because both versions of the ODBC drivers have the same DLL name, you
can only have one or the other installed.

There are two methods to revert to the Access 97 ODBC driver.

1. In Windows or Windows NT explorer, open one of the following folders:

    - If you are running Windows 95/98, open \Windows\SYSTEM.
    - If you are running Windows NT, open \WINNT\System32.

2. Rename the following files to have the .old file name extension.

   
   +-------------------------------------------------------+
   | File name (description)                | Rename to    | 
   +-------------------------------------------------------+
   | ODBCJT32.dll (Access 2000 ODBC Driver) | ODBCJT32.old | 
   +-------------------------------------------------------+
   | ODBCJI32.dll (Resource DLL)            | ODBCJI32.old | 
   +-------------------------------------------------------+
   | Odexl32.dll (Excel)                    | Odexl32.old  | 
   +-------------------------------------------------------+
   | Oddbse32.dll (dBase)                   | Oddbse32.old | 
   +-------------------------------------------------------+
   | Odpdx32.dll (Paradox)                  | Odpdx32.old  | 
   +-------------------------------------------------------+
   | Odtext32.dll (Text)                    | Odtext32.old | 
   +-------------------------------------------------------+
   | Odfox32.dll (FoxPro)                   | Odfox32.old  | 
   +-------------------------------------------------------+

3. To restore most of the ODBC files, re-install Office 97 or Access 97. Leave
   your CD in the drive.

4. To re-install the remaining ODBC drivers, on the Start menu, click Run, and
   then type the following command line:

   <CD drive>\Valupack\Dataacc\Dataacc.exe

Reasons for Reverting to the Access 97 ODBC Driver::

 - You are unable to import or export from Outlook 97 to the Access 97 format.

 - You have a third-party application that requires the Access 97 ODBC driver
   for design or performance considerations.

 - You are unable to update dBASE or Paradox files accessed via the Access 2000
   ODBC driver.

 - You receive this error message:

   Unrecognized database format '<path>\<filename>'.

NOTE:The information used in this article should only be used as a temporary
emergency measure in a controlled environment. The changes described in this
article will break applications which require the new Microsoft Access ODBC
drivers. The changes in this article will be undone if MDAC is upgraded in the
future, either by applying a service pack or installing a new application.

The following articles provide a more long term solution which will not affect
applications requiring the newer ODBC drivers:
