The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Windows NT Backup to view a catalog of backed-up files, some
files that you backed up may not be listed.

CAUSE
=====

When Backup reads the catalog, the Restore window may not be able to display all
of the files because of limitations in the program. The files are on the backup
tape, even though they may not appear in the Restore window.

WORKAROUND
==========

When you restore, the files are restored correctly, even though they were not
displayed in the Restore window.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Windows 2000.
