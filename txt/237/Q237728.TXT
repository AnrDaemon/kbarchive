PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdisplay kbui kbimu msgame

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft NFL Fever 2000, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Flee Flicker play in Microsoft NFL Fever 2000, you may be
unable to follow the execution of the play well enough to manipulate the play
manually before it is completed by default.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the speed of the game is set to Medium or High.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, set the speed of the game to Low:

1. On the Main screen, click Options, and then click Settings.

2. Next to "Speed of Play," click to select Low.

3. Click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Flee Flicker play involves a feigned end run by the halfback who stops
suddenly after several steps, pivots 180 degrees, and passes the ball back to
the quarterback.

The halfback performs this action so quickly that you may be unable to track the
ball carrier and play direction before the play is completed by default.

NOTE: You may be unable to follow the execution of any play that involves a
sudden, quick reversal of play direction, such as that which occurs in the Flee
Flicker play.
