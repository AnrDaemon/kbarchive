TITLE   :BUG: Deploying Shadow Files to a Live Web Site Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0; winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbInternet kbSSafe500bug kbSSafe600bug kbIIS kbGrpDSSSafe kbiis400bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Files shadowed to a live Web site don't get updated.

You may not get any error messages or you may get:

   Error "File <path being shadowed to> is already open"

CAUSE
=====

IIS 4.0 caches files to speed up Web requests. This caching keeps the file open
for a period of 30 to 60 seconds. During this time, if a shadow occurs, that
file is locked and cannot be updated.


RESOLUTION
==========

This issue will be resolved in the next major release of IIS version 5.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs because IIS 4 locks the file open in the Web browser. The
shadow command cannot write to the file because the file has a handle already
open. If the shadow command is attempted 60 seconds later, it will succeed.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In the Visual SourceSafe Administrator, create a shadow folder for any Visual
   SourceSafe project that is a Web site on an IIS 4.0 server. Select the Set
   read-only flag for all files checkbox.

2. Shadow files to the Web site.

3. Open one of the shadowed files in a Web browser through the URL, like
   "http://webserver/test.htm".

4. Check out and edit that file in Visual SourceSafe using any editor, such as
   Microsoft Notepad.

5. Check the file back in.
