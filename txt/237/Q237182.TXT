TITLE   :XFOR: MSMI Fails with Unknown Exception During Message Delivery
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5,5.5 SP1,5.5 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 exc55sp1 exc55sp2 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When sending mail between Ms Mail Postoffice and Exchange server, the mail may
not be delivered. The Microsoft Mail Connector interchange (MSMI) may fail with
an unknown exception error while the message transfer agent (MTA)continually
attempts to send a message.

CAUSE
=====

The MSMI recognizes a problem with a message that the MTA is attempting to
deliver to the MSMI. The MSMI returns a temporary failure condition to the MTA,
which causes the MTA to attempt to send the message again. The temporary failure
is caused by a component running out of buffer space when processing the
messages.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or

| Mtmsg.dll | 5.5.2625.0 | 
+------------------------+


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5, 5.5 SP1, and 5.5 SP2. This problem was first corrected in Exchange
Server 5.5 Service Pack 3.
