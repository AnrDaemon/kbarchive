KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbAdvertisement kbSoftwareDist kbsms200sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create an advertisement in Systems Management Server 2.0, you can set
the sending priority to low, medium, or high. When you choose either a low or
high priority, the actual sending priority used by the site server is reversed,
as detailed in the following table.

+-------------------------------------+
| Selected priority | Actual priority | 
+-------------------------------------+
| low               | high            | 
+-------------------------------------+
| medium            | medium          | 
+-------------------------------------+
| high              | low             | 
+-------------------------------------+

This behavior does not apply to the sending priority that you can set on
packages.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

WORKAROUND
==========

When you create an advertisement that needs a high priority, set the
advertisement priority to low.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior can adversely affect the timely delivery of advertisements in a
multiple-site hierarchy. Because site-to-site communication occurs using a
medium priority, any advertisements that are configured to use a high priority
are preempted by the site-to-site traffic.

It is especially important to configure advertisements created at a parent site
with a low priority if a fast delivery to the client is required.
