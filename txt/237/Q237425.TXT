TITLE   :Modem No Longer Dials After Approximately Two Days
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After a period of approximately two days (sometimes right after startup), the
modem no longer dials. The PPP and VPN interface are both connecting correctly,
but there is no activity on the modem and no error message is displayed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when an entry is configured to run a script, and in the
middle of processing the script, the link to the remote computer stops
responding (hangs). This causes the script engine to hang indefinitely, which in
turn stops the router from dialing out when the router is acting as a demand
dial router.

RESOLUTION
==========
