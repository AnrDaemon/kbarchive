-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When synchronizing changes made to a SourceCode Controlled Visual Fox Pro (VFP)
project (.pjx) between multiple developers, you use different techniques
depending on whether you are:

 - changing existing files.

 - adding or removing files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the following scenarios, you need to assume that there are two users, userA
and userB.

Synchronizing changes to existing files:

UserA checks out, modifies, then saves and checks in a file. To see the new
version of the file, userB chooses "Get Latest Version" of that file.

Microsoft Visual SourceSafe (VSS) does not provide a way of automatically
notifying users when a file is checked in. If an automatic notification is
desired, you should develop methods for providing that notification.

   Controlled Projects

In more complex scenarios, such as when multiple users may have the same files
checked out simultaneously, all users should periodically refresh the project
(From the Project menu select Refresh).

You might also want to Show Differences on a file to compare your local copy with
the latest version in VSS before "Getting Latest Version" from VSS, which would
overwrite your local copy.

Adding or removing files to or from a project:

If userA adds files to (or removes files from) a project, from the
Project->Source Control menu the userA selects "Update Project List. "UserB
then updates his/her project list by choosing the menu items mentioned in the
previous statement to see the changes made by userA.
