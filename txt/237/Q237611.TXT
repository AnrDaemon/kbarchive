TITLE   :SMS Executive Components Hang or Perform Slowly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Components of the SMS Executive service on a Systems Management Server 2.0 site
may stop responding (hang) or experience performance degradation when the
SMSExec_Prochist.dat file grows to a large size. This file is located in the
SMS\Data\Prochist folder on a Systems Management Server 2.0 site server.

CAUSE
=====

The SMS Executive service does not delete the SMSExec_Prohist.dat file when the
service is started.

WORKAROUND
==========

On the Systems Management Server site server exhibiting this problem:

1. Stop the SMS Executive service.

2. Delete the SMSExec_Prochist.dat file in the SMS\Data\Prochist folder.

3. Start the SMS Executive service.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because of the nature of this problem, it is not easily noticed. Consequences of
this problem might include packages taking too long to get distributed in the
site or to other sites, or client component upgrades at the site might not get
propagated to Client Access Point servers in a timely manner.

The process history file (SMSExec_Prochist.dat) is used in conjunction with
status messages reported by the components of the SMS Executive service. Before
creating a status message, the component thread scans the file. If the file has
grown to a size larger than 500 kilobytes (KB), there may be an adverse affect
on the overall performance of the site server. In severe cases, certain
components may appear to have completely stopped without producing any error
messages.

This condition may affect the following components:

 - Client Install Data Manager
 - Inbox Manager
 - Inbox Manager Assistant
 - LAN Sender
 - NT Logon Server Manager
 - NT Logon Installation Manager
 - Winnt Server Discovery Agent
 - Scheduler

This problem does not apply to SMS components that are not part of the SMS
Executive service.
