SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to view shared network resources on a network computer, one or
more shared folders are not visible, even though when you use another computer
on your network, you can view these resources.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if all of the following conditions are true:

 - The computer sharing the network resource is running Windows 2000.

 - The name of the shared folder contains more than 12 characters.

 - The computer you are using to view network resources is running Windows 98.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, change the name of the shared network folder to contain
12 characters or less.

STATUS
======

 

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 2000 supports long filenames for network shares. However, earlier
versions of Windows are unable to view these shared resources. In earlier
versions of Windows, you receive a warning when you attempt to give a share a
name that contains more than 12 characters.
