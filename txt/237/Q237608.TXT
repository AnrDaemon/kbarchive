======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When a User Profile Path is specified in User Manager for a particular user,
this user receives the profile in the path specified when logging on to a
Windows NT-based computer including a Windows NT Terminal Server-based computer.
If a Terminal Server Profile Path is specified, this user only receives the
profile in the path specified when logging on to a Windows NT Terminal
Server-based computer. If both paths are specified, the user receives the
profile specified in User Profile Path when logging on to a Windows NT
Workstation-based or Server-based computer. When logging on to a Windows NT
Terminal Server-based computer, the user receives the path specified in Terminal
Server Profile Path. This article describes how to require a Terminal Server
user to use a default profile when logging on.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To prevent a user from using their User Profile Path when logging on to a
Windows NT Terminal Server-based computer, you must specify a Terminal Server
Profile Path. To require a Terminal Server user to use a default profile when
logging on:

1. Start User Manager, double-click the appropriate user, and then click
   Profile.

2. In the Terminal Server Profile path box, type "C:\WTSRV\PROFILES\DEFAULT
   USER" (without the quotation marks).

When this user logs on to a Terminal Server-based computer, the Default User
profile is used as a template, and a profile with their user name is created in
the WTSRV\PROFILES folder on drive C.
