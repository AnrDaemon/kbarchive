When you are using the Bookman Old Style font, you may receive a stop error
message on a blue screen that is similar to one of the following:

    - STOP 0x0000001E (0xc0000005, 0xfccc6add, 0x00000001, 0x013b8020)

NOTE: The second and fourth parameters may vary depending on the system
configuration, but the second parameter is always within Vga.dll.

    - STOP 0x00000050 (0xca8971d0, 0x00000001, 0x0000000, 0x00000000)

NOTE: The parameters may vary depending on the system configuration.

CAUSE

This problem can occur when the video driver attempts to process a glyph with a
negative "x" position written to a particular screen position.

   8/18/99    4:53p            161,020  Bookosi.ttf   Alpha




STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Both the "stop 0x1E" error message and the "stop 0x50" error message have been
received when processing a glyph of the letter M in the Bookman Old Style italic
font. The "stop 0x1E" error message is commonly received on a Windows NT
Server-based or a Windows NT Workstation-based computer.


The "stop 0x50" error message is commonly received on a Windows NT Terminal
Server-based computer. It occurs in the Win32k.sys file rather than the Vga.dll
file because remote sessions do not use the server's video driver.
