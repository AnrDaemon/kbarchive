The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

With Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5 (SP5) installed, an attempt to resolve an
unqualified host name by using DNS may not succeed after the second attempt.
This problem can occur if the host is in the second or later entry in the domain
suffix search order. Windows NT then attempts to resolve the name by using WINS
and/or NetBIOS Broadcast.

After a period of six minutes, the condition is reset and the first two attempts
succeed and subsequent attempts do not succeed.
