======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you migrate users from Lotus Notes directly into personal folder files
(PSTs), users are unable to reply to messages from SMTP addresses. The messages
in the PST can be opened correctly, but the recipients on the message To line
are not resolved and no address is associated with the display name. However,
when you migrate users directly to an Exchange Server mailbox, the messages
appear correctly to the user, and they can be replied to correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The Migration wizard does not set the PR_SENDER_ENTRYID. This is by design, as
the intent is to have the client resolve the address to the latest one in the
global address list after the migration is finished. This issue only appears
when you migrate users directly to PSTs. Migrating the message to the Exchange
Server information store creates the PR_SENDER_ENTRYID of a one-off address
type. The Emsmdb32.dll does this, as it is the responsibility of the transport
to create this property before submitting the message. The Migration wizard now
sets the PR_SENDER_ENTRYID for the sender when migrating messages directly to
PSTs.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
