SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start one of the programs listed at the beginning of this
article, you may be prompted to insert the program CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive,
even if the program CD-ROM is already inserted in the CD-ROM drive.

If the CD-ROM is not inserted in the CD-ROM drive when you are prompted to insert
the program CD-ROM, you may continue to be prompted to insert the CD-ROM after
you insert the CD-ROM.

NOTE: If you type the path to the executable file of the program in the Drive box
of the prompt and then click OK, you may receive an error message similar to the
following:

   Cannot find the file: <filename> (or one of its components). Make sure
   the path and filename are correct and that all required libraries are
   available.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Insert the program CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive if it is not already
   inserted.

   executable file of the program in the Drive box, or click Browse and then
   browse to the location of the executable file of the program.
