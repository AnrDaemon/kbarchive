======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

An environment that successfully uses SNA Server Host Security features to allow
Single Sign-On (SSO) to a host may start experiencing a problem where the APPC
or 3270 Application does not work. This is caused by a security violation
because an invalid password is being sent to the host system.

An APPC application, such as COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS (COMTI),
may receive the following return codes after issuing an ALLOCATE to establish a
conversation with the host when this problem occurs:

   Primary Return Code = 0003 (AP_ALLOCATION_ERROR)
   Secondary Return Code = 080F6051 (AP_SECURITY_NOT_VALID)

Sample Scenario
---------------

 - The host application (for example, COMTI) successfully connects to the host
   using current user credentials that are cached in the Host Account Database.
 - The user changes his or her Windows NT password.
 - The host account password for this user is also changed to match the new
   Windows NT password.
 - The host application does not connect to the host because the previous
   Windows NT password is passed to the host because the Host Account Cache does
   not get updated to reflect the new password.

CAUSE
=====

The password change DLL (Snapwchg.dll) does not make any additional attempts to
connect to the Windows NT Password Synchronization Service (SNAPMP) if its first
attempt to connect to the SNAPMP service doesn't work. The first attempt of the
password change DLL to connect to the SNAPMP service occurs after it intercepts
the first password change notification since the DLL was initialized.

When this occurs, the Host Account Cache is not updated with the new passwords;
therefore, the passwords passed to the host when the SNA application starts are
the user's previous Windows NT passwords. If the previous passwords are no
longer valid on the host, security errors are returned to the application.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in SNA
Server version 4.0 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The password change DLL has been updated to include a retry mechanism in those
cases where it is unable to connect to the SNAPMP service after receiving the
first password change notification.

The password change DLL has also been updated to implement a retry mechanism in
those instances where it loses an existing connection to the SNAPMP service. For
additional information about this particular issue, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
