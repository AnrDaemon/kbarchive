SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a message using the Cyrillic (KOI8-R) character set, and then
send the message through a Microsoft Exchange Server computer that is configured
to use transport-neutral encapsulation format (TNEF), the Cyrillic characters
may not be displayed correctly when you view the message in an e-mail client.
This applies to Cyrillic characters included in the Subject field, the message
body, or attachment file names.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the TNEF properties are encoded using the Internet code
page instead of the Windows code page.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
