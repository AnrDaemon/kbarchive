SYMPTOMS
========

When you set up a Microsoft Mail Service for use with Outlook, you may receive
the following error message when you attempt to send or receive mail from a
Microsoft Mail postoffice or a Workgroup postoffice (WGPO):

   File is currently in use.

CAUSE
=====

Rights on the postoffice folder (such as Wgpo0000 for a Workgroup postoffice)
are set to Read Only and the folder cannot be written to.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the rights on the postoffice folder to Full Access for everyone.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Like a Microsoft Mail postoffice, a Workgroup postoffice is a "Store and
Forward" flat file database. As a message is passed through the postoffice,
files are constantly being created, modified, and deleted within the subfolders
of the postoffice.
