The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Server 4.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

FrontPage 2000 is not included with Small Business Server 4.5 or Back Office
Server 4.5 Upgrade.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 3 of the Getting Started Guide for Microsoft BackOffice Small Business
Server 4.5 incorrectly states, "Small Business Server 4.5 is a integrated server
software suite that includes...Microsoft FrontPage 2000, a full-featured web
publishing program."
Page 6 also incorrectly states that Microsoft FrontPage 2000 is included with
Small Business Server 4.5.

Small Business Server Version Upgrade Promotion (VUP) 4.5 and the retail version
include Microsoft FrontPage 98. You can set up FrontPage 98 manually from the
Frontpg folder on the second CD-ROM.

The retail box does correctly indicate that FrontPage 98 is included.
If you want to obtain FrontPage 2000, you can purchase it separately.
