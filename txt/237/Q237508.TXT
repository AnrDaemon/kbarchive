SYMPTOMS
========

When you turn on Closed Captions in Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 2000 and then
attempt to play a sound or video clip, or start an InterActivity, you may
experience one or more of the following symptoms:

 - The play button below the sound or video clip window is unavailable.

 - You cannot drag the sound or video progress bar.

 - If the sound is a spoken word recording, only the first sentence or sentence
   fragment of what is spoken is visible.

 - If you attempt to start an InterActivity, the InterActivity does not start.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if a sound card is not installed in your computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia
2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine if a sound card is installed in your computer:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System, and then click the Device Manager tab.

3. Click the PLUS SIGN (+) next to "Sound, video, and game controllers" to
