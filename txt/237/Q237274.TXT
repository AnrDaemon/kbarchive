SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a document in Word 97, you may receive the following error
message:

   This document may be corrupt. To preserve the contents: Choose Select All
   from the Edit menu, then choose Copy from the Edit menu. Create a new
   document, then choose Paste from the Edit menu.

CAUSE
=====

This error may be caused by a build-up of List Templates in a document. A List
Template is a container for a customized numbering scheme. In the numbering
gallery (on the Format menu, click "Bullets and Numbering"), each number gallery
position displays a different List Template. As you use or change List
Templates, the number gallery changes, based on the active List Templates.

The build-up can occur if you repeatedly switch between a bulleted list format
and a numbered list format for the same list.

You can also see this message while editing Master Documents that contain
numbered or bulleted lists.

NOTE: There are other known causes of a build-up in List Templates. Although this
update does not prevent the problem from occurring, it removes this form of
corruption and eliminates the error message.

To determine whether you are receiving the error message because of excessive
List Templates, follow these steps:

1. After you receive the error message, point to Macro on the Tools menu, and
   click Visual Basic Editor.

2. In the Visual Basic Editor, click Immediate Window on the View menu.

3. Type the following command in the Immediate window and press ENTER:

   ?activedocument.listtemplates.count

This problem is known to occur when the number of List Templates approaches
2,000.
