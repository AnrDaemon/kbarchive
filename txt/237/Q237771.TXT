======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) 3.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An ATL event sink defined with SINK_ENTRY or SINK_ENTRY_EX will fail to catch an
event when an enum is used as one of the parameters for the event. The failure
code returned by IDispatch::Invoke is "0x80070057 (E_INVALIDARG - The parameter
is incorrect)." The event will succeed in another container, such as Visual
Basic.

CAUSE
=====

IDispEventImpl's GetFuncInfoFromID method checks the type of the event
parameters and, on encountering type VT_USERDEFINED, calls GetUserDefinedType.
This method currently checks only for TKIND_ALIAS ("typedef struct" data types)
and not TKIND_ENUM.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are several ways to work around this problem. One method is to use the
SINK_ENTRY_INFO macro and define an _ATL_FUNC_INFO structure to provide type
information for the event method. Use a VT_I4 type for the enum parameter. For
an example, and for more information on SINK_ENTRY_INFO, see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q194179 SAMPLE: AtlEvnt.exe Creates ATL Sinks Using IDispEventImpl

If you are using IDispEventImpl<> for the sink, you can override the
virtual function GetFuncInfoFromID. A simple override is as follows:

   HRESULT GetFuncInfoFromId(const IID& iid, DISPID dispidMember,LCID lcid, _ATL_FUNC_INFO& info)
   {
   	// class base class implementation
       HRESULT hr = IDispEventImpl<IDC_OBJ, CSinkObj, &DIID__IEnumEventEvents, &LIBID_TESTUNKARTICLELib, 1, 0>::GetFuncInfoFromId(iid, dispidMember,lcid, info);
       if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
   	{
           // is this the correct event interface
           if (InlineIsEqualGUID(iid, DIID__IEnumEventEvents))
   		{
               //check for dispid of event with enum param
               switch(dispidMember)
   			{
                   case 1:
                       // the enumeration parameter is change to VT_I4
                       // info.pVarTypes represents the type of params
                       // params are stored in reverse order, with 0 base index
                       if (info.pVarTypes[0] == VT_USERDEFINED)
                           info.pVarTypes[0] = VT_I4;  
                       break;
   			}
   		}
   	}
       return hr;
   }

The most direct approach when using IDispEventImpl<>is to change the
implementation of GetUserDefinedType in Atlcom.h. At line 3968, after the code
block that begins "if(pta && pta->typekind == TKIND_ALIAS)", a second
if statement could be inserted that would set the correct VARTYPE for
enumerations. This block could be written as follows:

   if (pta && pta->typekind == TKIND_ENUM)
   {
       vt = VT_I4;
   }

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++ .NET.
