SUMMARY
=======

The IExpress Deployment Kit (IDK) is a group of utilities and Microsoft
Knowledge Base articles that can be used to generate user-specific profiles, as
well as roll out hotfixes or patches, by bundling all the appropriate files into
one custom package. This custom package can be run as a stand-alone executable
file or added to a logon script.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Administrators who are deploying Outlook need to dynamically generate profiles
and update Outlook with the various patches and hotfixes that are available. By
using the utilities and articles included in the IDK, administrators can
accomplish both of these tasks in one step during installation.

The IDK contains all the files and articles necessary to guide you through the
following tasks:

 - Create an IExpress package.

 - Cleanly generate profiles with user-specific settings. A sample setup
   information (.inf) file is included to assist you in this process.

 - Apply the patches available for Outlook.

 - Add your package to the Outlook Deployment Kit (ODK) for easy deployment.

The IDK also contains:

 - A fix for the "Out of Memory or System Resources" error message that you may
   receive when you are creating new journal items after installing Outlook with
   the ODK.

 - Profile Designer (Designer.exe), a graphical utility that helps you generate
   the custom package necessary for a user-specific profile.
