======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail cycles through several
iterations of directory updates to the cc:Mail post office for similar users
from different Exchange Server sites. For example, the following are three
Exchange Server users with different capitalization's in their names:

   Smith, Jimmy at Site 1
   SMITH, Jimmy at Site 2
   Smith, jimmy at Site 3

CAUSE
=====

Internally, the name comparison is case-sensitive in some places.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Lotus cc:Mail is case-insensitive and allows only one user to be created in its
directory even if they belong to a different post office. The Exchange Connector
for cc:Mail does not adhere to this behavior completely and thus incorrectly
sends an update to the cc:Mail post office every directory synchronization
cycle.
