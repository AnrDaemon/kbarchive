TITLE   :FTP GET Does Not Work Correctly on UNC Virtual Directories
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you map a virtual directory to a UNC path and allow Anonymous Access, you
may be able to PUT a file to the FTP site, but the GET command fails.


CAUSE
=====

When handling a PUT, FTP uses the credentials configured in the virtual
directory configuration dialog. The GET command uses the credentials of the
logged on user. The result is that you can send and delete the file to or on the
FTP server, but cannot get it back.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem.

WORKAROUND

On the UNC path that the virtual directory is mapped to, grant the correct
permissions to the Windows NT account used for Anonymous Access.
