TITLE   :XADM: Error Listed in Output File for KM Server Bulk Enrollment
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The text file that is generated when you run a Key Management server (KM server)
bulk enrollment by using the Exchange Server Administrator program contains text
that is similar to the following:

   /o=orgname/ou=sitename/cn=recipients/cn=username, ****** Error

CAUSE
=====

The user whose mailbox Distinguished Name (DN) is displayed in the error message
already has an enrollment token, but has not enrolled in advanced security.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The output in the text file contains information for users who are newly
enrolled, users who have been revoked, and users who have already received
tokens.

If a user is new, the file lists the DN and the token issued. If the user has
been revoked, the file lists the DN and revoked status. If the user has a token
and has not enrolled, the file lists the DN and the following text:

   ****Error****

NOTE: If the user has been revoked, the Bulk Enrollment tool does not re-enable
advanced security for the user.
