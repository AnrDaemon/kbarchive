The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

If you send mail from the Microsoft Exchange Client 5.0 with more than 64
attachments, only the first 64 attachments get delivered when your delivery
location is set to personal folders. Anything over 64 is not sent and no error
occurs. If you check the message in the Sent Items folder, the message shows the
correct amount of attachments. If you send the message to yourself and look in
the Inbox, it will only have 64 attachments. If your mail delivery is set to the
mailbox on the server, all the attachments are delivered.
