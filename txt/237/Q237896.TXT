TITLE   :Enhanced GET_LU_STATUS Incorrectly Indicates SyncPoint Support
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server version 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) includes an enhanced APPC
GET_LU_STATUS function where it is possible to determine whether a Local APPC LU
is configured with SyncPoint support. However, this new GET_LU_STATUS function
may incorrectly return syncpoint = AP_YES, causing TP_STARTED (with
syncpoint_rqd = AP_YES) to fail with the following error message:

   primary_rc = X'0001' (AP_PARAMETER_CHECK)
   secondary_rc = X'00000003' (AP_BAD_LU_ALIAS)

For more information on this function, see the following Knowledge Base article:

   Q235406 SNA Server Support for External Attach Managers

CAUSE
=====

GET_LU_STATUS returns syncpoint = AP_YES if the SyncPoint Support check box is
enabled for a Local APPC LU, even if the client computer name field is not
filled in properly, or contains a computer name that is not the same as the
computer where the TP_STARTED is issued. SNA Server Manager or the MMC (and the
SNACFG command line tool) should require the configuration of the client
computer name field when the SyncPoint Support check box is checked for a Local
APPC LU.

WORKAROUND
==========

If a Local APPC LU is to be used with SyncPoint-enabled applications. Both the
SyncPoint Support check box and the client computer name field must be
configured.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 3.
