TITLE   :XADM: How to Create a Windows NT User Account in Mixed Site
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a user on a computer running Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 and
Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5, the corresponding Microsoft Windows 2000 Active
Directory user logon name is not present.

CAUSE
=====

When you use the Windows NT 4.0 security account manager (SAM) application
programming interface (API) to create a Windows 2000 account, there is no way to
specify the user logon name during creation; therefore, none is created.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Install a Windows 2000 domain controller, a Windows 2000 member server with
   Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server, and a Windows NT 4.0 member server with
   Exchange Server 5.5 into the this domain and organization (site).

2. Create a new mailbox on the Exchange Server 5.5 computer, and then create a
   new Windows NT account.

Note that no corresponding user logon name has been created. To verify:

1. Start the Active Directory Users and Computers Microsoft Management Console
   (MMC) snap-in.

2. Click the newly created user account.

3. Click Properties, and then view the Account tab.
