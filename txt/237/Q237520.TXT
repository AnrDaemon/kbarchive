======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open an article in Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 2000, the article may
take an unexpectedly long time to appear on the screen or the program may stop
responding.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the microprocessor (CPU) installed in your computer
meets or only barely exceeds the minimum system requirements needed to run
Encarta Encyclopedia 2000.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, install a faster microprocessor in your computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia
2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a CD-ROM changer is installed in your computer, you may be able to improve
performance by inserting only one Encarta Encyclopedia compact disc in the
CD-ROM changer at any one time.

When you are prompted to insert the other Encarta Encyclopedia CD-ROM into the
CD-ROM drive, remove the Encarta CD-ROM that is currently in the CD-ROM changer
before you insert the other disc.
