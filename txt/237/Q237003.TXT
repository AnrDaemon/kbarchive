PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOSWinNT400sp4bug kbiis400bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) to run a default Web
site application in a separate memory space, a session may be established even
though you specified a sessionless event in the Session_OnStart code of the
application file. However, the session is only established the first time an
Active Server Pages (ASP) page is loaded; after that, a sessionless event is set
as specified.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To start a sessionless default Web site in Internet Information Server, follow
these steps:

1. Right-click the application under Default Web Site.

2. Click Properties.

3. Click the Directory tab.

4. Click to select Run in separate memory.

   The ASP pages and application files are loaded and administered by the Web
   Application Manager (WAM), which can be accessed at a command prompt by
   typing

   "IWAM NetBIOS computername" (without the quotation marks)

   and then pressing ENTER.
