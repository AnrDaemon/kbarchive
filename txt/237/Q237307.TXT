TITLE   :WINS Lookup May Not Resolve Some Name Queries
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you enable WINS Lookup in a DNS zone, some name queries using Windows
Internet Name Service (WINS) may not be resolved. In addition, the following
error message may be displayed:

   Name does not exist.

If you attempt to use Nslookup to resolve the name, the following error message
may be displayed:

   Cannot find queriedname: Non-existent domain.

If you attempt to Ping the name, the following error message may be displayed:

   Bad IP address queriedname.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the DNS server times out prematurely.

WINS Lookup queries may time out up to one second before the configured timeout
value. For example, if you specify a timeout value of 1 second, the query may
time out between 0-1 seconds; if you specify a timeout value of 2, the query may
time out between 1-2 seconds, and so on.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, increment the WINS Lookup timeout value by 1. For
example, if the DNS server is configured for a timeout value of 1, increase the
value to 2.

NOTE: You can change the timeout value on the WINS Lookup tab in zone properties.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Windows NT Server 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you perform a test in Network Monitor, the response "RCODE 3, Name Error" is
returned in the reply to the originating DNS client from the DNS server.
