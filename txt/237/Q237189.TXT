TITLE   :XFOR: Subject Prefix "Re:" Changes in CCMC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

If the post office language of the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus
cc:Mail (CCMC) is set to Japanese, when a cc:Mail user using an English cc:Mail
client replies to a message sent by an Exchange Server user, the Subject prefix
"Re:" is changed to a Japanese character.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by design. The CCMC has no way of knowing what language the
client is using. It only knows the language of the cc:Mail post office. So if
the cc:Mail post office is Japanese, the CCMC should replace "Re:" with the
appropriate Japanese character.

This scenario does not only occur on a Japanese post office, but also on other
language versions. The prefix is replaced with a character of or term from that
language. Even with an English CCMC, any subject with prefix "Re:" is changed to
be "RE:".

In addition, the CCMC uses the language that you select on the Post Office tab
for all the status messages.

Steps to Reproduce the Problem
------------------------------

1. Install a Japanese cc:Mail post office.

2. Install a computer running Windows NT Server 4.0 SP4 with the Japanese
   Language Pack.

3. Set up an Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2 computer with the CCMC and add
   the Japanese locale.

4. Configure the CCMC to connect to the Japanese cc:Mail post office, and set
   the post office language of the CCMC to Japanese.

5. Log on to Exchange Server and send a test message to a cc:Mail user,
   "ccuser1", with a subject of "Test Message".

6. Use English cc:Mail client to log on to the cc:Mail post office as "ccuser1"
   and reply to the test message. The subject becomes "Re: Test Message".

7. Log on to Exchange Server again. The subject of the reply message is "?:Test
   Message". Using the Japanese client, you find the "Re" is replaced with a
   Japanese character.

The conversion takes place in the Ccmc\Src\Ccmc\Cc2ems.cpp file:

   LPWSTR CCCtoEMS::pwszSubject( IN CCMailMessage *pccmm )

   // If this is a reply or a reply to a reply set up the subject and
   // normalized subject to ensure correct sort order on Exchange Make
   // sure that if it talks and walks like a duck that it is a duck
   // the format we're looking for is "Re[n]: Subject"
   ......
   // reset the subject and set up the NormalizedSubject
        m_pwszNormalizedSubject	= WszDup (pwszPrefixEnd + 1);
        m_pwszSubject = CCMC_NEW WCHAR [wcslen(g_rgpwsz[EXCHANGE_REPLY_PREFIX]) 
           + wcslen (m_pwszNormalizedSubject) + 1];
        wsprintf (m_pwszSubject, L"%s%s", g_rgpwsz[EXCHANGE_REPLY_PREFIX],
           m_pwszNormalizedSubject);  
        pccmm->hrSetSubject( m_pwszSubject );

So the normalization of the subject is designed to fix the aforementioned
"Re[n]:" problem.
