======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
 - Microsoft Visual Studio versions 6.0 SP3, 6.0 SP5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the PrintForm method of the Form object, if the Form contains a
Microsoft FlexGrid (MSFlexGrid) control, the MSFlexGrid control prints as a
black box. This only occurs on Windows NT and Windows 2000. The control prints
correctly on Windows 95 and Windows 98.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use the Microsoft Hierarchical FlexGrid
(MSHFlexGrid) control, which appears as "Microsoft Hierarchical FlexGrid Control
(SP3) (OLEDB)" in the Components dialog box. Switching to this control should
not require coding changes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Visual Basic 6.0 running in
Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) or SP5 under Windows NT 4.0 and Windows
2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. On the Project menu, click Components.

3. In the Components dialog box, click "Microsoft FlexGrid Control 6.0 (SP3)".
   The name of the control is Msflexgrid.ocx. Click OK. Notice that a new icon
   is added to your toolbox for the FlexGrid control.

4. Double-click the FlexGrid icon in the toolbox to add the control to Form1.

5. In the General Declarations section of Form1, add the following code:

   Private Sub Form_Load()
      Me.PrintForm
   End Sub

6. Make sure that you have a default printer set up, and then press the F5 key
   to run the project. On the printout, notice that a solid black box appears
   where the FlexGrid should appear.
