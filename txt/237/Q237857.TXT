TITLE   :Error 5aa When Using the Regrest Tool
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Regrest.exe (included in the Windows NT resource kit) to restore
registry hives that you backed up using Regback.exe, you may receive the
following error message:

   Replacing sam with sam.old
   Replace failed hivebranch='machine', hive='sam', result='0x000005aa'
   newfile='sam.old'
   savefile=sam.bak'

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because Regrest.exe requires enough space for two copies of
the registry hives that you are restoring. When Regrest.exe restores registry
hives, it loads the new copies into memory (along with the old copies). When the
computer is restarted, the new copy is used and the old one is deleted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, increase the maximum Registry Size Limit to at least
twice the current size:

1. On the toolbar click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
   double-click System.

2. On the Performance tab, click Change in the Virutal Memory section.

3. In the Registry Size section, type the appropriate value in the Maximum
   Registry Size (MB) box.

4. If this still fails with the error then stop and disable all third party
   services and restart.

5. Run steps 1 - 3 again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Error 5aa hex is error 1450 in decimal format. The following text is contained
in error 1450:

   Insufficient system resources exist to complete the requested service.
