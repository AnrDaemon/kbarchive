TITLE   :XADM: Exchange On-line Restore Fails with Event ID 8010
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An on-line restore of the Exchange Server computer on a Cluster Server may fail
with the following Event ID error in the application log:

   Event ID: 8010
   Source: NTBackup
   Type: Error
   Description:
   Microsoft Exchange services returned 'XXX' from a call to
   'ControlService(STOP)' additional data 'MSExchangeDS'

CAUSE
=====

NTBackup tries to stop the Exchange Directory service rather than taking it
off-line through the Cluster service.

WORKAROUND
==========

Before running NTBackup, use Cluster Administrator to take the Exchange
directory or information store off-line. After these services have been taken
off-line, you can start NTBackup and proceed with the on-line restore as usual.

Additional query words: Failure won't start Wolfpack Node
