SUMMARY
=======

You may need a way to introduce messages through text files onto the Internet.
By creating a file which is in the RFC-822 format within the
Root\Inetpub\Mailroot\Pickup subdirectory, the SMTP Relay Host will pick up this
file, resolve its destination e-mail domain, and deliver the message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create such files, applications must be able to communicate using
Collaboration Data Objects for Windows NT Server (CDONTS). An example of CDONTS
is using a FrontPage Server Extension in the creation of Web pages to send the
user's input in RFC-822 format to the above mentioned directory location.

To distribute these files to the appropriate e-mail domains, you must have the
IIS and SMTP selections within the NT Option Pack installed. Once installed, the
SMTP host, using its preconfigured DNS entries for name resolution, will route
any RFC-822 format compliant message placed in the Pickup folder to the
appropriate e-mail domain.
