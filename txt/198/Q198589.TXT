SUMMARY
=======

The documentation for the LVCOLUMN structure used by the ListView common control
indicates that you can use the fmt member of the LVCOLUMN structure to set the
justification of a column in the ListView control. This article shows you how to
determine the value of the justification of a column in the ListView control.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before you check the value of the fmt member of the LVCOLUMN structure, the
value of this member must be bitwise "anded" with the flag LVCFMT_JUSTIFYMASK,
which is defined in Commctrl.h. For example, the following code shows you how to
determine whether the second column in a list view is right, center, or left
justified:

      LVCOLUMN lvc;
      // Assume hWndOfLV is an HWND of an existing ListView control window.
      if(ListView_GetColumn(hWndOfLV, GetColumn, 1, &lvc))
      {
         switch(lvc.fmt & LVCFMT_JUSTIFYMASK)
         {
            case LVCFMT_RIGHT:
               // Right justified
               break;
            case LVCFMT_CENTER:
               // Center justified
               break;
            case LVCFMT_LEFT:
               // Left justified
               break;
         }
      }
