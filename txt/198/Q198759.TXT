KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

Custom attributes can be exported during the Move Server operation even if they
do not have the same name (description and admin-display-name) in both the
source and in the destination sites. The data is preserved while the attribute
name might differ.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To test the behavior, follow these steps:

Configuration:

 - Server S1 in site1/org1

 - Server S2 in site2/org2

1. In site1, rename CustomAttribute1 as BirthDate.

2. In site2, rename CustomAttribute1 as HiringDate.

3. Create a mailbox, M, on S1, and set BirthDate = 5/6/65.

4. Move server S1 to site2/org2.

Result:

M in site2/org2 will have HiringDate = 5/6/65.
