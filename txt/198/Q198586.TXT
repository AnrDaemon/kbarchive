IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT Service Pack 4 (SP4) allows you to set user-defined properties as
cached through registry keys. Prior to SP4, a document containing the property
had to be indexed, and then cached through the property interface for Index
Server. This information was then stored in the catalog. If the catalog became
corrupted, the property cache information was lost and had to be recreated
manually.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

To cache a property through the registry, perform the following steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\Currentcontrolset\Control\Contentindex
   \Catalogs\<catalog name>

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.
3. Under the catalog name, create a new key named Properties.

4. Under the Properties key, add string values for the properties that you want
   to cache. The format is GUID [PropID | Propertyname] = "type, size."

   Example:

      d1b5d3f0-c0b3-11cf-9a92-00a0c908dbf myprop = "31,20"

   This creates a new property named "myprop" that is cached as a datatype of
   VT_LPWSTR with a length of 20.

   Example:

      f29f85e0-4ff9-1068-ab91-08002b27b3d9 5 = "31,20"

   This caches a property with a property ID of 5 as a datatype of VT_LPWSTR with
   a length of 20.

5. After you add the registry entries, you must rebuild the catalog. The easiest
   way to do this is to look in the properties of the catalog in the Microsoft
   Management Console (MMC) and find the location of the catalog. That location
   on the drive contains a Catalog.wci folder. Stop Index Server and delete all
   the files in the Catalog.wci folder, and then restart Index Server. This
   forces a rebuild of the catalog using the new registry settings.
