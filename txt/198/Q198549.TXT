SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to add rows to the Invoice.dot and Purchord.dot
templates.

NOTE: Word 97 Setup does not install the Invoice and Purchase Order templates. If
you installed Word 97 from a compact disc, these and other templates are located
in the ValuPack\Template\Word folder. To use them, copy them to your template
folder (usually, C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Templates).

MORE INFORMATION
================

To add rows to these templates, follow these steps:

1. On the File menu, click Open.

2. Open the template (Invoice.dot or Purchord.dot).

3. On the Tools menu, click Unprotect Document.

4. Position the insertion point in the last row of the table (the row just
   before the Subtotal row).

5. On the Table menu, click Select Row.

6. On the Format menu, click Borders And Shading.

7. On the Borders tab, use the Borders sample diagram to cancel the bottom
   border selection.

8. Click OK.

9. With this row still selected, click Copy on the Edit menu.

10. Select the Subtotal row. On the Edit menu, click Paste Rows.

11. Double-click the Form field in the first cell (in the Quantity column).

   The Text Form Field Options dialog box appears.

12. In the Bookmark box, under Field Settings, type "Quantity_8" (without the
   quotation marks). If you are adding more than one row, type the next
   consecutive number.

   In the Purchase Order template, there is also a Unit column. Double-click
   this form field. Name the bookmark "Unit_8" (without the quotation marks).

13. Double-click the form field in the next cell. In the Bookmark Name box, type
   "Description_8" (without the quotation marks).

14. Double-click the form field in the next cell. In the Bookmark Name box, type
   "Price_8" (without the quotation marks).

15. For the Invoice template, follow these steps:

   a. Double-click the last form field.

   b. Type "Amount_8" (without the quotation marks) for Bookmark Name.

   c. The Default Number box shows:

   =PRODUCT(A8,C8)

      Change this to:

   =PRODUCT(A9,C9)

      These cell numbers represent the quantity and price for the current row.

   For the Purchase Order template, follow these steps:

   a. Double-click the last form field.

   b. Type "Amount_8" (without the quotation marks) for Bookmark Name.

   c. The Default Number box shows:

   =PRODUCT(A8,D8)

      Change this to:

   =PRODUCT(A9,D9)

      These cell numbers represent the quantity and price for the current row.

   If you need to add more rows, repeat steps 9 through 15, incrementing the
   bookmark number for all form fields for each consecutive row.

16. If you do not want to add more rows, select the last row that you created,
   and click Borders And Shading on the Format menu.

17. In the Borders folder, use the Borders diagram to select the bottom border.

18. Use the appropriate procedure for the template you are using.

   For the Invoice template:

   a. Double-click the Total Due form field.

   b. Modify the calculation by adding the number of rows that have been added
      to the existing values. If you added two rows, then add two to the
      numbers, for example:

   =SUM(D11,D12,D13)

   For the Purchase Order template:

   a. Double-click the Total Due form field.

   b. Modify the calculation by adding the number of rows that have been added
      to the existing values. If you added two rows, then add two to the
      numbers, for example:

   =SUM(E11,E12,E13,E14)

19. On the Tools menu, click Protect Document. In the Protect Document For area,
   click Forms. Click OK.
