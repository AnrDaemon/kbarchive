======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server versions 1.2 and 2.0, if you enable Power
Management, remote control may fail. Windows 95 and Windows 98 clients that use
remote control over TCP/IP may experience problems if they are idle for an
extended period.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when power management is enabled through CMOS or software on
Windows 95 and Windows 98 computers. This can occur on either portable or
desktop systems that have power management enabled.

When the timeout value is reached, the BIOS enables power management on the
system. On some systems running TCP/IP, this causes Windows 95 and Windows 98
clients to send a DHCP release of its IP address, causing all TCP/IP sessions to
lose connectivity. If the systems are using TCP/IP as the remote access
protocol, the Remote Control Agent (Wuser.exe) no longer listens on the released
IP address.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, disable power management through either CMOS or
software.
