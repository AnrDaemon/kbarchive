SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to read a postal bar code in order to determine
whether Microsoft Word created the correct bar code.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A postal bar code is composed of three main components: framing bars, number
bars, and checksum bars.

The first bar on the left side and the last bar on the right side of the postal
bar code are framing bars for the postal bar code. You can ignore these.

To read the bar code, start with the second bar. Group the bars into groups of
five bars each. Each number in a postal bar code consists of five bars.

The following address is used as an example:

                                                     of Street Address

The checksum is the smallest number that, when added to the total of the other
digits, gives a result that is a multiple of 10. The checksum in this example is
8. When you add 8 to 52 (the sum of the other digits)-- the result is 60, a
multiple of 10.
