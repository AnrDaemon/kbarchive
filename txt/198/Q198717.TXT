======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Several steps must be taken to prepare clients for Remote Tools. Remote Tools
can only be installed on the following clients: Microsoft Windows NT 3.51,
Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows for Workgroups, or
Windows 3.11. These clients must be a discovered resource in the Systems
Management Server site, and must have the core client components installed on
them.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because Remote Tools are a client component that is not installed by default,
the Remote Tools Client Agent, under Client Agents, must be set to "Enable
remote tools on clients". A valid client installation method must already be in
place and working.

Note that during installation, when you initially enable remote tools on a client
in the Client Agents section, Microsoft recommends that you review the options
that are selected on the Advanced tab. These options cannot be changed later.
When changes are made on the Advanced tab, they are not propagated to clients
that already have the Remote Tools installed.

IMPORTANT: You must be careful that you set these options correctly for the site,
before you enable Remote Tools.
