TITLE   :SMS: Forcing Changes in RC Settings to 32-bit Clients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbClient kbRemote kbsms200 kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When settings are changed at the site for the Systems Management Server Remote
Control Agent, some of these changes are not automatically implemented at
existing clients in the site. In particular, the protocol, the compression type,
and the video acceleration are not changed on existing clients. Newly installed
clients will get current settings for the Remote Control Agent.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This action is by design. You can, however, force an update on clients by using
any of the following methods:

 - At the client, start Control Panel and double-click the Systems Management
   icon to initiate a component reinstallation. On the Components tab, click the
   Remote Control component, and then click the Repair Installation button. When
   the agent is reinstalled on the client, it will receive the current settings.

 - At the client, run the following command line:

   %WinDir%\MS\SMS\CLICOMP\REMCTRL\RCHWCFG.EXE install

   This will cause the current settings for the items listed above to be
   refreshed. This option can also be implemented using the software
   distribution capabilities of Systems Management Server.

 - Use Systems Management Server Administrator to disable the remote tools
   client agent, wait for the component to be removed on the clients. (The
   client becomes active and uninstalls the agent at the next polling interval,
   every 23 hours.) Change the settings as appropriate and enable the agent so
   that the clients will reinstall that component and receive the current
   settings.
