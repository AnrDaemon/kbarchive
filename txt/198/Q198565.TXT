TITLE   :XCLN: Application Conversion Assistant May Crash with Dr. Watson
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Application Conversion Assistant may fail (crash) with a Dr. Watson error
when it attempts to parse a Lotus Notes database.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is due to the software's dependency on the Notes API stack. There
are potentially many more different reasons why the Application Conversion
Assistant crashes.

One known case is when the Application Conversion Assistant attempts to read a
Notes database design containing missing or corrupt fields. For example, a Notes
designer may have inserted a shared-field object into a database without
actually associating it with anything. This would cause a crash.

RESOLUTION
==========

Future versions of the Application Conversion Assistant will bypass the
dependency on the Notes API stack, and problems of this nature will disappear.

WORKAROUND
==========

Remove the problematic Notes design element before running the Application
Conversion Assistant.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
