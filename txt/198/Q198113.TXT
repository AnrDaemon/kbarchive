IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if

SUMMARY
=======

This article explains the steps necessary to create an IExpress package
containing the files necessary to generate a profile for each user who logs on
to a computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Creating profiles for each user logging on to a computer is a four-step process,
which is explained in the following sections.

Modifying the Outlook.prf File
------------------------------

Using a text editor such as Notepad, open the file Outlook.prf. Within this file
locate the entry:

      OverwriteProfile=

This is located in Section 1 - Profile defaults, under the heading [General].
Change the value from "Yes" to "No" (without quotation marks).

Save changes to the file and close Notepad.

Creating a User-Specific Profile with IExpress
----------------------------------------------

For additional information on generating user-specific profiles with IExpress,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q193114 XCLN: How To Generate A User-Specific Profile with IExpress and ODK

Make this Package Accessible for All Users
------------------------------------------

There are three ways to make the file available to users:

 - Place it on a network location. This should be a location users have access
   to after they log in to their computer.

 - Place the file on the computers' local hard drive and run it from there.

 - You may deploy this file to your user's computers using System Management
   Software.

Update the Registry on the Workstation
--------------------------------------

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys and
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To update the registry on the workstation, perform the following steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Select the following Registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

3. From the Edit menu, point to New, and then click String Value.

4. In the right pane, change the New Value #1 to UserLogin, and press Enter.
   Double-click the UserLogin value.

5. In the Edit String dialog box, for Value data, type in the full path name of
   where you have placed your IExpress package as described in the "Creating a
   User-Specific Profile with IExpress: section above, and then click OK.

6. Quit Registry Editor.

Each time a user logs on to the computer, a profile will be generated.
