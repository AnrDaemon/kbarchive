The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Pack 1 
 - Microsoft Proxy Server versions 1.0, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When accessing an Outlook Web Access (OWA) server using Windows NT
Challenge/Response (NTLM) authentication on the Exchange virtual directory in
Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) through a Microsoft Proxy Server,
you may get the following error:

   OWA was unable to get your Inbox.

CAUSE
=====

NTLM is not supported through Proxy Server because NTLM requires a persistent
connection.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, turn NTLM authentication off on the Exchange
Virtual Web in IIS, and set permissions to Basic Clear Text.
