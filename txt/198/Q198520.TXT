======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++.NET (2002) 
 - Microsoft SQL Server version 7.0 
 - Microsoft SQL Server 2000 (all editions) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SQL Server 7.0 and SQL Server 2000 provide a mechanism for performing
distributed queries against an OLE DB provider. This can be done by using the
new OpenQuery or OpenRowset function. For example, the following SQL statement
performs a query against an OLE DB provider called MyProv by using the command
"Select * from table1":

   Select * from OpenRowset('MyProv', '', 'Select * from table1')

If an ATL wizard-generated OLE DB Provider is queried by using the following
command, an error occurs:

   select * from openrowset ('MyProv.MyProv', '','c:\*.*')

The error message is:

   Server: Msg 7399, Level 16, State 1, Line 1 OLE DB Provider 'atlprov'
   reported an error. The provider ran out of memory

CAUSE
=====

There are a couple of fixes that must be made to the Atldb.h header file. The
fundamental problem exists in two areas:

 - The ATL IRowsetImpl::GetColumnInfo method fails to return information
   correctly.

 - The IRowsetImpl::GetData method doesn't handle provider-owned memory
   correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Atldbfix.h, provided below, is a revised copy of the Atldb.h file included with
Visual Studio Service Pack 5. Search the Atldbfix.h header file for "Fix:" to
find where the changes have been made.

Instead of including the Atldb.h header file in your project, you can replace it
with the Atldbfix.h file, which is provided below in this article. Once you do
that, you will encounter the next error message:

   Server: Msg 7347, Level 16, State 1, Line 1 OLE DB Provider 'Atlprov'
   returned an unexpected data length for the fixed-length column '[].FileName'.
   The expected data length is 260, while the returned data length is 12.

This error is caused by a bug in the ATL wizard-generated code, which returns a
fixed-length string when it should be returning a variable length string of type
DBTYPE_STR.

In the ATL wizard-generated sample provider, change the following two lines in
the provider column map from the following

   PROVIDER_COLUMN_ENTRY("FileName", 4, cFileName)
      PROVIDER_COLUMN_ENTRY("AltFileName", 5, cAlternateFileName)

to the following:

   PROVIDER_COLUMN_ENTRY_STR("FileName", 4, cFileName)
      PROVIDER_COLUMN_ENTRY_STR("AltFileName", 5, cAlternateFileName)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create an ATL project using the ATL COM AppWizard.

2. Create an ATL OLE DB Provider. On the Insert menu, click New ATL Object, and
   then select Data Access for the category and Provider for the object.

3. Build the ATL OLE DB Provider.

4. Register the provider on a machine with SQL Server 7.0 installed.

5. Run a query against the provider by using the command:

   Select * from OpenRowset('YourProviderName', '', 'c:\*.*')
