TITLE   :WD97: Err Msg: "MergeField Was Not Found..." When Mail Merging
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfield word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to run a mail merge using a main document and data source that were
created in Word version 5.x for Macintosh, the following error message may
appear:

   Error! MergeField was not found in header record of data source.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the Word 5.x document contains a MERGEFIELD field with a
division (/) symbol. This symbol is not converted correctly in later versions of
Word.

For example:

In a converted Word 5.x main document, you may have a MERGEFIELD that resembles
one of the following examples:

   <<Zip/10>>

   -or-

   { MergeField Zip/10 }

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the MERGEFIELD so that it resembles the
following:

   { = { MergeField Zip } / 10 }

NOTE: To change field codes in the Word versions listed at the beginning of this
article, use the ALT+F9 shortcut keys.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
