PRODUCT :Microsoft Mastering Series

KEYWORDS:kbMastVbp kbDSupport kbGrpDSTools

SYMPTOMS
========

There is a 32 KB limit on how much information can be put in the Notebook
feature of the Mastering Series products.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Notebook feature in the Mastering Series titles will generate a *.lst file
on the hard drive (in \lists directory). The size of this file cannot exceed 32
KB without information being truncated. You can create bookmarks and notes in
the application that exceed 32 KB, but once you have shutdown the application
and restarted then the *.lst file will be truncated to 32 KB. Consequently, many
bookmarks and notes will be lost.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the Mastering Series products.
