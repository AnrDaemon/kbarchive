SUMMARY
=======

Window NT Load Balancing Service cluster control program (WLBS.exe) allows you
start, stop, and query the cluster from any networked Windows NT system. You can
control all cluster hosts with one command, or you can control them
individually. Certain actions, such as modifying parameters, can only be
performed on the cluster hosts. Because it is a console-based application, this
program can be incorporated into scripts used for system management. The command
line for WLBS.exe has the following form:

   WLBS <command> [<cluster>[:<host>]
   [<remote_options>]]

The control program has full password protection to prevent unauthorized access.
By default, WLBS.exe will send remote control requests to UDP port 2504.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WLBS uses UDP port number 2504 for receiving remote control requests, while
Convoy used port 1717. By default, WLBS.exe will send remote control requests to
port 2504 and will not be able to control mixed Convoy/WLBS clusters. Please
note that, for backward compatibility, WLBS hosts will still respond to remote
control requests on port 1717 in addition to the new port 2504 if Convoy hosts
are detected as part of the cluster.

Additional query words: Convoy
