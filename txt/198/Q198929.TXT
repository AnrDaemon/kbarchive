SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Web Administration tool to create an expiration policy, you may
receive the following error saving the change:

   error 'ASP 0115'
   Unexpected error
   <path to asp file>
   A trappable error occurred in an external object. The script cannot continue
   running.

In some cases, the browser may stop responding or one or more frames may become
disabled (grayed out).

NOTE: This ONLY occurs on the addition of the FIRST expiration policy. If the
computer is rebooted, the expiration policy is in place, and the Web
Administration tool will allow subsequent policies to be added.

WORKAROUND
==========

Create the first expiration policy using the Microsoft Management Console.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Server version 4.0.
