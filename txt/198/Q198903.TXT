PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Connector for IBM OV/VM does not support the delivery of
"messages" from the host to Exchange Server.

In the OV/VM environment, it is possible to send "messages" rather than "notes"
to other Office users. "Messages" are smaller versions of "notes." When a host
user attempts to send a "message" to an Exchange Server user, an error will
occur on the RSCS console with the following error message:

   No active path to [NODE] is currently open. Message sent to <username>
   at node <node>.

CAUSE
=====

The only form of mail documents supported by the Microsoft Exchange Connector
for IBM OV/VM connector are "notes."

WORKAROUND
==========

Instruct host users to send only "notes" to Exchange Server users.

STATUS
======

Microsoft acknowledges this to be a problem.

Additional query words: RSCS, console, messages, error, missing
