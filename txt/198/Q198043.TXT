SYMPTOMS
========

If you select the Link to File check box and insert a file that starts with a
table at the beginning of a document, Word adds a paragraph mark to the
beginning of the document. You cannot delete this additional paragraph mark.

NOTE: The additional paragraph mark is not displayed when the Field Codes option
is selected.

If you insert a file that begins with a table at the start of a document and do
not select the Link to File check box, Word does not add the paragraph mark to
the beginning of the document.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the extra paragraph mark disrupts the page layout of your document, you can
change the paragraph line spacing setting to 0.01 inch by following these
steps:

1. On the Format menu, click Paragraph. Select Exactly in the Line Spacing box,
   and type "0.01"" (without the quotation marks). Note the inches mark.

2. Click OK.
