SUMMARY
=======

The Software Metering (SWM) client agent must be configured correctly in order
to perform, set up a SWM server, and configure the Tool itself. The client
machine itself holds no configurable aspect of SWM. All the client agent
configuration is done through the MMC Systems Management Server Administrator
Snap-In. The client machine does hold the SWM agent, Licclint.exe (32-bit)
Liccli95.exe (16-bit).

However, there are several SWM components installed on the client. The first is
the agent (or .exe) itself. The second is the adding of the SWM directory
structure. You can observe this by the LICMTR directory located as a
sub-directory of %windir%\ms\sms\clicomp. This is where the SWM agent's .exe
file will be stored along with the client's SWM data files.

Finally, two registry keys are added on the client:

 - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Client\Sites\<site
   code>\LICENSE_METERING - which indicates where the SWM license servers for
   the site reside (the client has randomly picked these),

   -and-

 - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Client\Client Components\LICENSE
   METERING - which is the component information for the client.
