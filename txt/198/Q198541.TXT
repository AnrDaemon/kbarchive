TITLE   :Using DHCPCMD to Modify a Reservation Converts It to a Lease
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the DHCPCMD command ADDRESERVEDIP to modify an existing
reservation, error 20022 (ERROR_DHCP_RESERVEDIP_EXISTS) is returned. When you
subsequently inspect the reservation using DHCP ADMIN, the reservation has been
turned into an active lease. If DHCPCMD is run again to modify the lease, it
works correctly and is turned back into a reservation.

CAUSE
=====

This is a problem in DHCP server, which incorrectly handles the modification of
an existing reservation, causing the reservation to be partially deleted. This
results in the remaining data looking like an active lease.

Running the same command again causes the reservation to be correctly re- added.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:
