TITLE   :SMSINST: HKEY_USERS - User Specific Key Is Repackaged
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms kbsms200 kbsms120 kbsmsInst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer versions 1.0, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Repackaging feature of Systems Management Server Installer to
capture registry changes, the Repackager captures user specific entries under
HKEY_USERS\<sid>, where <sid> is the globally unique Windows NT
security identifier (SID) of the user account logged in during the Repackage
operation.

WORKAROUND
==========

Exclude the HKEY_USERS hive from being scanned during the Repackage operation by
completing the following steps:

1. From Installation Expert, choose Repackage.

2. From the Repackage Installation dialog box, click Change.

3. In the Repackage Advanced Settings dialog box, click the Registry tab.

4. In the top left Explorer window, expand the HKEY_USERS tree until you see a
   SID-specific entry similar to the following example:

   S-1-5-21-124524958-708259337-1543119820-8585

5. Highlight this entry and click Add Tree. This adds the tree to the keys to
   ignore list on the bottom left. All subkeys and values within this item will
   not be captured during the Repackage.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
Installer version 1.0 and 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Capturing changes in this tree or subtrees is not necessary or useful because
the Repackage operation captures the duplicate registry changes for
HKEY_CURRENT_USER, which is the actual instance of that same current user's
registry hive. Also, the SID-specific keys will not be correctly written to a
target computer that runs the resulting Systems Management Server Installer
executable script because that SID may not necessarily exist on the target
computer.
