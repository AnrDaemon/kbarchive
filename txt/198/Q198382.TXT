TITLE   :WD97: Word Does Not "Fast Save" Document
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Word will not do a fast save of your document, even when the Allow Fast Saves
option is selected.

CAUSE
=====

The following are some reasons why Word will not perform a fast save of your
document:

 - When you save a document for the first time, Word performs a full (normal)
   save to write the file to the drive.

 - When your document is located on a network server or remote volume, the Allow
   Fast Saves option is ignored, because Word only performs a fast save to a
   local volume, such as your local hard disk or a floppy disk.

 - When you click Save As and save the document under a new name, in a different
   location, or in a different file format.

 - Word has reached the limit of how much information it can save using the
   Allow Fast Saves option. In this case, Word performs a full (normal) save,
   and the Allow Fast Saves option is ignored. The Allow Fast Saves option is
   again available the next time you save the document following a full save.

 - When you select the Make Backup option in the Save As dialog box, Word must
   do a full (normal) save, so the Fast Save option is ignored.

 - The Allow Fast Saves option is unavailable (not selected).

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you select the Allow Fast Saves check box, Word appends only the changes to
the document. This takes less time than a full save, in which Word saves the
complete, revised document.

When Should You Do a Full Save?
-------------------------------

 - Before you share a document with other people.

 - When you finish working on a document and save it for the last time.

 - Before you begin a task that uses a lot of memory, such as searching for text
   or compiling an index.

 - Before you transfer the document text to another program.

 - Before you convert the document to a different file format.

To Set (or Clear) the Allow Fast Saves Option
---------------------------------------------

On the Tools menu, click Options. On the Save tab, click to select (or clear) the
Allow Fast Saves check box.

For more information about fast saves, click Contents And Index on the Help menu,
click the Index tab in Microsoft Word Help, type the following text

and then double-click the selected text to go to the "The difference between a
fast save and a full save" topic. If you are unable to find the information you
need, ask the Office Assistant.
