SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT security makes it possible to lock down a desktop so a given user has
access to only one or a few specific programs. On a public kiosk computer, it is
often important that user access be restricted. This article explains the steps
that need to be taken to implement this.

1. Create a text file named Lockout.reg. You can cut and paste the following
   text:

   REGEDIT4

   [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies]

   [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer]
   "NoDriveTypeAutoRun"=dword:00000095
   "NoFind"=dword:00000001
   "NoFolderOptions"=dword:00000001
   "NoFavoritesMenu"=dword:00000001
   "NoRecentDocsMenu"=dword:00000001
   "NoSetActiveDesktop"=dword:00000001
   "NoDesktop"=dword:00000001
   "NoSetFolders"=dword:00000001
   "NoSetTaskbar"=dword:00000001
   "NoSaveSettings"=dword:00000001
   "NoClose"=dword:00000001
   "NoNetHood"=dword:00000001
   "NoRun"=dword:00000001
   "NoDrives"=dword:00000000
   "NoTrayContextMenu"=dword:00000001
   "NoViewContextMenu"=dword:00000001

   [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System]
   "DisableLockWorkstation"=dword:00000001
   "DisableTaskMgr"=dword:00000001
   "DisableChangePassword"=dword:00000001

2. Determine what drives you want the user to be able to access, and then change
   the value of the "NoDrives" line accordingly. For example:

   To give access to only drive C -> "NoDrives"=dword:fbffff03
   To give access to drives C and D -> "NoDrives"=dword:f3ffff03
   To give access to drives A to F -> "NoDrives"=dword:c0ffff03

3. Determine if you want a compact disc to start automatically when you place it
   in the CD-ROM drive. If you do not want this to happen, change the
   "NoDriveTypeAutoRun" to:

   "NoDriveTypeAutoRun"=dword:b5000000

4. Determine if you want to enable the user to log off or to shut down the
   computer. You can disable these by adding one or both of these two lines:

   "NoClose"=dword:00000001
   "NoLogoff"=dword:00000001

5. Create a new user with User Manager. Set up the menu structure that you want
   the user to see. This can be done by adding and removing short cuts from the
   <Windows NT>\Profiles\%USERNAME% and the <Windows
   NT>\Profiles\All Users folders. For example:

   C:\WINNT\Profiles\NewUser and C:\WINNT\Profiles\All Users.

6. Log on as the new user and set up the environment (screen savers, background,
   and so on).

7. Find the file you created in the steps above and double-click it.

8. Log back on as the user. You will notice that the desktop is empty and the
   start menu only has the shortcuts that you configured in step 4. As stated in
   article Q182439 "How to Disable Start\Help," it is impossible to remove the
   help item from the start menu. You can disable this by creating a text file
   named Windows.hlp and copying it over the existing file in the <Windows
   NT>\System32 folder.
