TITLE   :XADM: After Running the MSW, Creating News Feeds Generates Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After joining a server into a site using the Microsoft Exchange Move Server
Wizard (MSW), when you try to create a news feed, the following error message
may be generated:

   The client operation failed Microsoft Exchange Server Information Store ID
   no: 80070057-0501-00000000

The news feed is created even though you click Cancel. Errors occur during the
public folder creation, and newsgroups cannot be added.

CAUSE
=====

As the server moves to an existing site, its public store is deleted. Therefore,
a different public folder server is set for the moved server.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you plan to create a news feed on the moved server, the following operations
should be performed on the moved server:

1. Create a public store on the moved server. To do so, in the Exchange Server
   Administrator program, on the File menu, click New Other, click Information
   Store, click Public, select the moved server, and then click OK.

2. Edit the Private Information Store object, and set the moved server as the
   public folder server.

3. Set up the news feed.
