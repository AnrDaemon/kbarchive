TITLE   :WD97: New Word Is Not Added to Custom Dictionary
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:word97kbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you check the spelling in your document and click Add to add a word to the
custom dictionary, the word is not added to the custom dictionary and you do not
receive any error message.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the custom dictionary has reached 64 kilobytes (KB)
(65,593 bytes) in size.

WORKAROUND
==========

Method 1: Add Words to the Custom Dictionary Using WordPad
----------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Do not use Word to edit your custom dictionary. Word will truncate your
custom dictionary when the file size exceeds 64 KB.

The custom dictionary files typically are installed in either of the following
folders on your hard disk:

   <drive>\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Proof

   -or-

   <drive>\<windows folder>\Msapps\Proof

where <drive> is the letter of the hard disk that contains either of these
folders.

To determine where your custom dictionary is located, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. Click the Spelling & Grammar tab.

3. Click Dictionaries.

4. Select your custom dictionary. The Full Path to your custom dictionary
   appears under the Language box.

5. Click Cancel and then Close.

To add a word to your custom dictionary, open your custom dictionary into WordPad
by doing the following:

1. To start WordPad, point to Programs on the Start menu, point to Accessories,
   and then click WordPad.

2. Add the additional words you want.

3. Save the custom dictionary as a text document.

Method 2: Add A Second Custom Dictionary
----------------------------------------

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. Click the Spelling & Grammar tab.

3. Click the Dictionaries button.

4. Select your custom dictionary, and then click Remove.

   NOTE: You need to remove your custom dictionary, so the new dictionary you
   will add in step 5 will appear first in the list of custom dictionaries.
   Words added to a Custom Dictionary will default to the first Custom
   Dictionary dialog box.

5. Click New to add a new custom dictionary.

6. Type a name for the new custom dictionary and click Save.

7. Click Add, select the custom dictionary you removed in step 4, and click OK.

   NOTE: The custom dictionary is now the second item in the list.

You can now add words to your new custom dictionary, and Word will use both
custom dictionaries to check the spelling of your documents.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are approximate limitations for a custom dictionary:

   Number of words in custom dictionaries 5,000

   Maximum custom dictionary file size 65,593 bytes (64 KB)

NOTE: The number of words contained in your custom dictionary may vary due to the
number of characters or the length of each of the words added to your custom
dictionary.
