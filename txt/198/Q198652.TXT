CAUSE
=====

This error message can be caused by the SQL Server being out of available user
connections.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, increase the number of SQL Server user connections. To
do this, perform the following steps:

1. Start SQL Server Enterprise Manager.

2. Right-click the SQL Server server name and click Configure on the shortcut
   menu.

3. In the Server Configuration/Options dialog box, scroll to the User
   Connections entry and increase the number of connections in the Current
   column.

After making this change, you must stop and start the SQL Server service for the
change to take effect. You can stop and start the service through the SQL Server
Service Manager, Control Panel Services, or the command line with the "net stop
mssqlserver" and "net start mssqlserver" commands.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
