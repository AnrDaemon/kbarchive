following methods:

 - On the Options menu, point to Simulation Rate, and then click the simulation
   rate you want to use.

-----------------------

 - Press and hold down the R key, and then press the HYPHEN (-) key to reduce
   the simulation rate by one setting, or the EQUAL SIGN (=) key to increase the
   simulation rate by one setting.

The following simulation rates are available in Combat Flight Simulator:

 - Slowest
