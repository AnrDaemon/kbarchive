TITLE   :Windows NT Load Balancing Service Cluster Is Not Load Balancing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Load Balancing Service 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT Load Balancing Service (WLBS) is not load balancing an application or
applications, and the default host handles all network traffic.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because a port rule is missing. By default, WLBS directs all
incoming network traffic for the cluster IP address to the default host. This
ensures that applications you do not want load balanced will behave properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To load balance an application across the cluster, you should create a port rule
on every cluster host for the TCP/IP port or ports serviced by the application.
