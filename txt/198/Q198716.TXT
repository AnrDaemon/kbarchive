TITLE   :SMS: Server Side Remote Control Components Maintain SMS Security
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The components required by the server to run Systems Management Server (SMS)
Remote Control are stored in the <local root>\SMS\BIN\<platform>
directory. The required files are:

REMOTE.EXE
MULTPROT.DLL
LDFTRANS.DLL
LDWMNT.DLL

These files are installed during the Systems Management Server Administrator
Snap-In install (this happens automatically on site servers).

Remote.exe, although usually run from within the Microsoft Management Console
(MMC) Systems Management Server Administrator Snap-In, it can also be run from a
command line. The MMC must be present on that machine because the Remote Tools
relies on Windows Management (WMI) to access the Systems Management Server
database in SQL. WMI is used to call the database to confirm the client's valid
network address or NetBIOS name which prevents it from being used as a stand
alone tool, thus preserving the Systems Management Server Security model.
