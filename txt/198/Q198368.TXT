TITLE   :WD97: Text Boxes/Drawing Objects Not Merged with Track Changes
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you merge documents (on the Tools menu, click Merge Documents), the text
box or drawing object and its contents are not merged when both of the following
are true:

 - The document you choose to merge has been set to track changes.

   -and-

 - The document you choose to merge contains a text box or drawing object that
   has had text added as a tracked change.

CAUSE
=====

The Merge Documents feature only recognizes text in the text layer of a
document. Because text box and drawing object text reside in the drawing layer
of a document, the text and/or tracked changes are not merged.

MORE INFORMATION
================
