TITLE   :XCLN: ErrMsg: Mapi32.dll Is Missing or Corrupted
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:98
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 98 Deployment Kit 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While you install Outlook 98 using the Outlook Deployment Kit (ODK), the
installation appears to complete successfully. However, when you attempt to
start the client, you receive the following error message:

   MAPI32.DLL is missing or corrupted

CAUSE
=====

Because Mapi32.dll is already in use by another application, the updated version
of this file could not be copied over the previous version installed by Outlook
97. As a result, several other .dll files required by Outlook 98 are not
installed either. Because the file is in use at the time of installation, it is
considered locked open by the Setup program, and cannot be overwritten with the
newer version of these files.

RESOLUTION
==========

Close any programs that may be using Mapi32.dll, like Outlook or the Exchange
client, before running Setup from the Outlook Deployment Kit either manually or
through a login script.
