SUMMARY
=======

In Systems Management Server (SMS) version 2.0, remote control tends to cause
CPU utilization to rise depending on the configuration of the remote control
settings.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Remote Control in SMS 2.0 has been shown to utilize more of the CPU when
controlling clients running with higher screen resolutions.

On a Windows NT 4.0 system, running with low compression and no acceleration, the
percentage of "Privileged" CPU time is higher than the "User" CPU time. The task
of capturing screen data is what raises the CPU utilization.

The CPU utilization as reported by the Task Manager may consistently stay between
90 percent and 100 percent during a remote control session in which acceleration
is loaded and compression is set to High. This can also be attributed to the
work the CPU must perform in order to compress the data to reduce the amount of
network bandwidth used.

If compression is set to Low, then CPU utilization can be expected to fall
between 50 and 65 percent (approximate values) according to the Task Manager and
never goes to 100 percent.

You may experience some performance issues during a remote control session.
Memory usage on the client should remain normal during any remote control
sessions.

For these reasons, you should keep in mind the performance impact on Application
servers and how long you leave a remote control session open to one.
