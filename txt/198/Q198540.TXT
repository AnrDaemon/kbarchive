The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

SYMPTOMS
========

When a large number of users are simultaneously logging on to a Windows NT
Terminal Server computer and a group policy is in use, some of the users may
receive an error 1000 in the application event log. The source of the error will
be Userenv and it contains text similar to the following:

   RegLoadKey failed with error 5 for
   C:\windows\profiles\<username>\prf1.tmp

CAUSE
=====

This error only occurs the first time the user logs on or if the user's policy
file has been recently altered. It is caused when several users attempt to load
their profile into the registry at the same time, and one or more of them fails
to access the registry key because another user currently has it open.

RESOLUTION
==========

4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, click the following
