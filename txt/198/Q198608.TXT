SUMMARY
=======

Some printers require a Logical Not character for print control. This character
can be translated using a host code page file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A host code page is used to perform character translation between EBCDIC
characters from a host and ASCII characters used for printing.

The default code page within Microsoft SNA Server translates an EBCDIC "5F"
(without the quotes), sent from the host, to ASCII AC. However, the Logical Not
character is ASCII "5E" (without the quotes). The two steps below are necessary
to translate 5F to 5E.

First, a code page file must be modified. Code page files are included on the
Microsoft SNA Server CD in the PRINTSERVERADDONS directory. Code page file
E037ansi.cpg is appropriate for the English (United States) character set. Open
the file with a hexadecimal editor, and change the AC character found in row 5,
position F, to 5E. Save the modified file.

Second, the print session in SNA Server Manager must be configured to use the
modified file for character translation. This setting is found on the General
tab of the print session Properties dialog box. Select Custom, and click the
File button to select E037ansi.cpg. The file may be placed in any directory on
the Microsoft SNA Server. After this change is made, save the configuration, and
restart the SNA Print Service.

More information on character translation and the host code page files is found
in the "Microsoft SNA Print Service" white paper. It is found at http://ww
w.microsoft.com/sna/guide/print.asp?A=2&B=6.

The Microsoft SNA Server Reference contains information on character translation.
Appendix E, "Host Print Service Character Translation Table Format," describes
the table format and the character translation process. This information is
available via on-line help in SNA Server Manager.
