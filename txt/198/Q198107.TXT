======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The file Ol98qfe.exe, which shipped on the client CD for Exchange 5.5 Service
Pack 1 in the En\Support\Update\Smime directory, is required in order to provide
full Key Management Server connectivity and S/MIME security. It also introduces
several protocol and usability fixes.

Below is a comprehensive list of fixes that are included in this self- extracting
file:

 - There is a problem upgrading V1 Certificates to V2 and V3 Certificates
   automatically. The upgrade does not work automatically as expected.

 - JPN: When you export or import a Digital ID, there is no option to select
   Internet Security (*.pfx,*.p12)" in "files of type" in the Import a Digital
   ID dialog box. This dialog box is on the Security tab when you click Options
   from the Tools menu.

 - When a user is sending a message from V3 only to V1 only, you receive the
   following error message:

   TDXScodeFromHR failed with hr=0x80000057

   and an Out of Memory error.

 - Outlook crashes before the V2 to V3 certificate renewal process finishes.

 - Clicking Next or Previous causes items to shift when the taskbar is placed at
   left or top of the desktop screen.

 - Help About was changed to include DataViz information.

 - JPN: International Security/Charset:UTF-7 and 8 Signed/Encrypted messages are
   corrupted on Conversation Monitor System.

 - The client fails to process the V3 renewal response correctly.

 - When you switch from V1 to V3 and click the renew all button, you are not
   able to read V3 mail messages.

 - Imported CRl is not getting picked up by the Outlook98 client.

 - Recipients cannot read V3 encrypted message sent to many people.

 - The Certificate Trust List signing certificate is getting added to the root
   store, causing the V3 certificate not to be trusted.

 - After you install Olcsp128.exe, the Cryptography Service Provider fails to
   get registered in the registry.

 - Revoking a user's V1 certificate and then switching the KMS server to V3 does
   not allow the user to enroll in V3 properly.
