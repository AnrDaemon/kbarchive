======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a user on a computer running Windows NT Workstation logs on with an expired
password and is prompted to change the password, he or she receives either of
the the following errors:

   You do not have permission to change your password.

-or-

   Unable to change the password on this account (C00000BE). Please consult your
   system administrator.

CAUSE
=====

Users can receive the above error messages under a variety of conditions. The
underlying cause for these errors is a security registry change involving the
RestrictAnonymous value. For additional information about the RestrictAnonymous
value, please see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q143474 Restricting Information Available to Anonymous Logon Users

Scenario 1
----------

In this scenario, the following conditions are true:

 - RestrictAnonymous is enabled on the PDC.

 - The primary domain controller (PDC) is running Service Pack 3 (SP3).

 - The clients are running SP3.

 - Strong passwords are enforced on the domain, either by Passfilt.dll or
   Passprop.exe from the Windows NT resource kit, or a minimum password length
   is specified in the Account Policy in User Manager for Domains.

If the client attempts to change an expired password when logging on and it does
not meet the password requirements, the following error message will be
displayed:

   You do not have permission to change your password.

If the password meets the password requirements, the password should be changed
successfully. The error text is reported incorrectly and should state that the
user's password does not meet the domain policy. This issue is addressed in
SP4.

Scenario 2
----------

In this scenario, the following conditions are true:

 - RestrictAnonymous is enabled on the PDC.

 - The PDC is running Service Pack 4 (SP4).

 - The clients are running SP3.

If the client attempts to change an expired password when logging on, the
following error message will be displayed:

   Unable to change the password on this account (C00000BE). Please consult your
   system administrator.

Because a null session is used for this password change, the operation fails.

Scenario 3
----------

In this scenario, administrators can have the "Users must log on in order to
change password" account policy enabled. For additional information, click the

   Q135060 Access Denied Attempting to Change Client Domain Password

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, remove the RestrictAnonymous entry or set the value
to 0, and then restart the PDC. This workaround will resolve both scenarios
above. In scenario 2, upgrading the clients to Service Pack 4 will also resolve
the problem.
