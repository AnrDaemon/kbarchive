TITLE   :XCON: Messages Remain in Queue and Are Resent at MTA Startup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

On extremely rare occasions, the message transfer agent (MTA) continues to
resend a message after every successive restart until the message age exceeds
the Held-For-Transmit Timer for the object, resulting in the non-delivery report
(NDR) shown below:

   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

   Subject: RE: Test Message Sent: 10/29/98 1:37 PM

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

   User, Test on 12/15/98 9:44 PM The maximum time for delivering the message
   expired MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:NorthAmerica:Test01

CAUSE
=====

After a messages is transferred from the MTA, the MTA sometimes fails to delete
a .dat file, (usually the file is locked), from the Mtadata folder, which leads
to the object remaining in the queue. Thus, the next time the MTA is restarted,
the message is resent.

STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1 or
later.
