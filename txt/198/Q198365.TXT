KEYWORDS:kbfield word97

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to enter a number into a number form field formatted with
parentheses, the parentheses are lost, and the number is changed to a decimal
value.

For example, when you insert a number form field into a Word document and change
the Number Format to include parentheses, as in a telephone number

   (###) ###-####

the number you type into the protected form field does not include the
parentheses and is changed to a decimal value as in the following example:

   8005551212.00

WORKAROUND
==========

Use a different character in the Number Format. Do not use parentheses in the
Number Format of the Number Form Field.

For example, in the Number Format of the Number Form Field, use a dash to
separate the area code, as in this example

   ###-###-####

which results in the following when you type your number in the protected forms
document:

   800-555-0188

To change the number format, follow these steps:

1. On the Forms toolbar, click the Protect Form button to unprotect your form
   document.

   NOTE: If the Forms toolbar is not showing, on the View menu, point to
   Toolbars, and then click Forms.

2. Double-click your number form field to access the Text Form Field Options
   dialog box.

3. In the Number Format box, delete the parentheses and type a different
   character to separate the area code from the rest of the telephone number,
   and then click OK.

4. On the Forms Toolbar, click the Protect Document button to re-protect your
   form document.

======
