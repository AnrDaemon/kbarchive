SUMMARY
=======

If you completely reinstall Exchange Server 5.5, you will have to reinstall Key
Management Server as well. The following article outlines the steps necessary to
recover Key Management Server to a computer with the same name.

You need the following before you can successfully restore Key Management
Server:

 - A backup of the Kmsdata directory from the original Key Management Server.

 - The alpha string that you input when you start the Key Management Server
   services, or the start up disk.

1. Reinstall Exchange Server, any service packs, and Key Management Server. It
   will create a new alpha string for you to write down or store on disk.

2. After installation, stop the Exchange Key Management Server service.

3. Go to the <path>\Exchsrvr\Kmsdata directory, and delete all files.

4. Restore the Kmsdata directory from backup.

5. Go to Services, and select the Microsoft Exchange Key Management Server
   service.

6. On the start up parameters, type in the alpha string, or insert the start up
   disk from the old (original) Key Management Server.

7. Start the Microsoft Key Management Server service.

At this point, you have recovered and successfully reinstalled the original Key
Management Server and all of its data.
