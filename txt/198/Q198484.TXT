PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook for Macintosh, Exchange Server Edition, versions 8.0, 8.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use Outlook for the Macintosh, address information is stored in a
Personal Address Book, or .pab file. The client cannot select e-mail addresses
from an Outlook Contacts folder.

Outlook for the Macintosh is not comparable feature for feature to the Windows
32-bit versions of Outlook. Outlook for the Macintosh does not recognize the
custom items contained in a personal Outlook Contacts folder, nor can it display
them correctly. Outlook for the Macintosh does not have the capability of using
Outlook Address Books.

Use Personal Address Books to manage e-mail addresses from Outlook for the
Macintosh.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is also possible to use Outlook Web Access (OWA)(Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 1 or later) to allow a Macintosh to see personal Outlook Contacts folders.
Using OWA allows the Macintosh user to see and address e- mail to items in a
personal Outlook Contacts folder.
