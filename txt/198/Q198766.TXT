SUMMARY
=======

Systems Management Server 2.0 MIF processing is similar in functionality to
Systems Management Server 1.2. However, there are a number of questions that
need clarification. This article's intent is to answer common questions, such as
the following:

 - BADMIFS: In Systems Management Server 1.2, if a MIF is rejected by Inventory
   Dataloader and is then placed into the BADMIFs folder. MIFs placed into
   BADMIFs are not re-evaluated by Inventory Dataloader and will have to be
   removed manually.

 - When No DDR Is Received: In Systems Management Server 2.0, if the item is of
   a discovered architecture but is not found in the discovery database, the
   Inventory Dataloader rejects this MIF and places it in the ORPHANS directory.
   It then writes a Data Discovery Record (DDR) to the Discovery Data Manager's
   (DDM) inbox, and retries the contents of the ORPHANS directory every 10
   minutes until the item is processed. This process is necessary to ensure that
   the discovery item has the same key as the inventory data.

 - When the MIF Is Too large: The default Max MIF size is set to 5,000,000 bytes
   on the site server. If a MIF exceeds the value defined on the site server,
   the MIF is rejected and placed into BADMIFs folder in Systems Management
   Server 2.0.

 - Set the Default Max MIF Size: You can increase the maximum MIF size value in
   the registry on the Site Server. The registry key is:

   hkey_local_machine/software/microsoft/sms/components/SMS_Inventory_Dataloader/Max
   MIF Size

WARNING: If you increase this value in the registry, the disk space usage on the
site server may quickly increase. The default setting allows almost a 5 MB MIF
to be processed for each client. The larger the MIF size allowed, the longer it
takes for the Inventory DataLoader to process, and the more resources are used
on the site server.
