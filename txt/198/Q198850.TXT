   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

Whenever a modem is added to Small Business Server (SBS), an entry for the modem
is added under the fax server registry settings. When a modem is removed,
however, the entry remains in the registry. This may cause some unintended
interruptions in the fax service, or various other symptoms.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, use the following procedure to delete the unneeded
entry:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double- click
   Services.

2. Stop the Microsoft Fax Service.

3. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe)

4. Go to the following key:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Fax\Devices\ 

   At this time, you may want to save the key in case an entry needs to be
   restored.

5. There will be a key for each installed and uninstalled modem. The keys will
   have been named using a random, 8-digit number. Delete the keys that are not
   needed.

6. Restart the Microsoft Fax Service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are unable to determine which modem keys are needed and which can be
deleted from the registry, follow this procedure.

1. Before stopping the Microsoft Fax Service, click Start, point to Settings,
   click Control Panel, and then double-click Fax Server.

2. Click the Receive tab. Select an installed modem and change one of the
   settings (CSID, Rings before answer, routing options, and so on). Repeat for
   all installed modems.

3. In the registry, look under the parameters for each modem listed. The ones
   that are currently installed will have the new values, while the unneeded
   modem entries will have the old values.

4. After you restart the Microsoft Fax Service, reset the changed values back to
   the original settings.
