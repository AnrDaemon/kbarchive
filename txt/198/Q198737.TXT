TITLE   :SMS: Changes Irreversible When Logging Components to One File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbStatSum

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When logging is enabled for multiple Systems Management Server 2.0 components,
and set to use one log file, you cannot reset the components to log in separate
log files.

To allow multiple components to log to one file, open Service Manager and select
the Components object. The components will be listed in the right pane. Select
multiple components and click Logging. Click to select the Logging enabled check
box, click the "Use same file for all selected components" check box, type the
log file name, and then click OK. Logging is now enabled for the selected
components and only uses the log file that you specified.

After logging is enabled in this manner, you cannot reset the selected components
to log in individual log files. You can clear the "Use same file for all
selected components" check box, but the change is not saved and logging
continues to use the log file specified.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
