TITLE   :PRB: Error Running Setup Wizard under Apple OS 8.5
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbwizard kbAppSetup kbHWMAC kbvfp300b

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Setup Wizard (including the updated Setup Wizard available on
the Microsoft Web site, for information on this version, please refer to the
article in the REFERENCES section) in Visual FoxPro 3.0b for the Macintosh,
running on Apple OS 8.5 to compress files totaling more than one megabyte, the
following error occurs during compression:

   The Setup Wizard was unable to make a copy of your source files. Setup
   terminated.

RESOLUTION
==========

If possible, run the Setup Wizard on a Macintosh running an operating system
prior to OS 8.5.



MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Install Visual FoxPro 3.0b for the Macintosh on a computer running OS 8.5.

2. Create a project that contains a program file with a WAIT WINDOW command.
   Compile this into an executable.

3. Move the executable to a separate directory and start the Setup Wizard.

4. Walk through each step. Make sure you choose the run-time libraries and
   graphical help in step 3. This causes the Setup Wizard to compress more than
   one megabyte of files. If the files total less than one megabyte, the error
   may not occur.

5. In step 6 of the Setup Wizard, click Finish.

The error listed in the SYMPTOMS section occurs at some point during the
compression process.
