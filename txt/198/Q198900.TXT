SYMPTOMS
========

When using an older version of Systems Management Server Installer to open a
script (.ipf) file that was created with version 2.0.64.00 of the Installer, you
may receive the following error:

   The instruction at "0xXXXXXXXX" referenced memory at "0xXXXXXXXX". The memory
   could not be "read".

(.ipf) file.

version 2.0.64.00 cannot be opened correctly with older versions of the
Installer.
