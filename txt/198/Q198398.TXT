SYMPTOMS
========

An access violation in Snalink.exe may occur if numerous 802.2 Data Link Control
(DLC) connections are activated concurrently in SNA Server Manager. The number
of connections that have to be activated for this problem to occur varies,
however it is more likely to occur when activating 50 or more 802.2 DLC
connections concurrently. If Drwtsn32.exe is configured as the default debugger
on the SNA Server system, the Drwtsn32.log file will be generated that contains
entries similar to the following when this access violation occurs:

Application exception occurred: App: exe\snalink.dbg (pid=<process ID>)
When: <date> @ <time> Exception number: c0000005 (access violation)

[...]

function: DlcGetDlcApiBuffer

CAUSE
=====

The SNA DLC Link service (Snadlc.dll) does not correctly handle errors that it
receives when the link service internal Logical Link Control (LLC) buffer pool
is exhausted. The failure to correctly handle these errors causes the access
violation in Snalink.exe.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 4.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack


SNA Server 3.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
3.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q184307 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 3.0 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

Instead of activating all of the configured 802.2 DLC connections concurrently,
activate them individually or in smaller groups.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 4.0.
This problem was first corrected in SNA Server version 3.0 Service Pack 4 and
SNA Server version 4.0 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you apply the update, the 802.2 DLC Link service will not generate an
access violation when activating numerous connections. However, some of the
connections may not activate (they will be in an Inactive state) or some of the
LUs (Logical Units) defined on the connections may stay in an Inactive state.
This can occur when the LLC buffer pool is exhausted. If it appears that the LLC
buffer pool is too small, it can be increased by setting the following registry
entry:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/<snadlcX>
   /Parameters/ExtraParameters/ where <snadlcX> is the link service name
   (that is, SnaDlc1, SnaDlc2, and so forth). NOTE: The above registry key is
   one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry
   value:

      Value Name: LlcBufferPoolSize
      Data Type:  REG_DWORD
      Value:      <pool size in bytes>

   The default pool size is 1024000. If the buffer pool is being exhausted,
   a value of 4096000 will allow a larger pool that should allow more
   connections to be started concurrently.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

The SnaDlcX link service must be stopped and started for this change to take
effect. This can be accomplished by stopping and starting the SNA Server
service. However, if SnaDlcX has been distributed for use with the SNA
distributed link service, the SnaDlcX service must be manually stopped and
started.
