PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



SYMPTOMS
========

This article lists known problems using Windows 95 for Pen Computing and Word
for Windows.

The following gestures do not work:

 - Edit Text gesture (check mark circled)

 - Insert Text gesture (caret circled)

 - Context Menu gesture (M circled), can't right-click for Context menus

 - Select gesture (lasso tap)

The following symptoms and problems may be experienced:

 - Pen Windows display does not refresh correctly when the pen is near the
   digitizer pad.

 - When the pen is near (or in contact with the digitizer) and the barrel button
   is pressed, the cursor changes to an I-Beam.

 - The pen "drag handle" is not shown. This is a small button that floats along
   with the insertion point, allowing access to a context menu and easier access
   with a pen.

 - You cannot drag a selection with the pen.

 - When you neatly print characters using the pen stylus, the characters are
   connected as if you had not lifted the pen between printed characters.

WORKAROUND
==========

Context Menu Gesture (M circled)
--------------------------------

Press SHIFT+F10 with the pen at the point where you want a context menu.

Display Refresh Symptom
-----------------------

Keep the pen away from the digitizer pad when not in use. For additional
