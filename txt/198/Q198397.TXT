TITLE   :Dr. Watson Does Not Seem to Trap GP Faults
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool osr2 win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a general protection (GP) fault occurs, the Dr. Watson program
(Drwatson.exe) does not display any indication that the GP fault has occurred,
even though Dr. Watson is running.

CAUSE
=====

The version of Dr. Watson included with Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 does
not display any indication that a GP fault has occurred. Instead, it logs the
fault information in a file named Faultlog.txt. This file is stored in the
Windows folder and is appended each time a GP fault occurs.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
