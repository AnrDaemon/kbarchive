======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to log on to Exchange Server with Outlook Express using Secure
Password Authentication, you may see the following error messages in Outlook
Express. Look in the Details of the Error tab after failing to connect.

   * Unable to logon to the server using Distributed Password Authentication.
   Account:'Company POP3 Server Accnt.',
   Server: 'server.company.com',
   Protocol: POP3,
   Server Response: '-ERR The AUTH protocol exchange was canceled by the
   client.',Port: 110, Secure(SSL): NO, Server Error: 0x800ccc90, Error Number:
   0x800ccc18

On the Exchange Server computer you will see the following Event IDs:

   Application event log error:
   13005 MSExchange Pop3 Authentication
   Logon attempt by NTDomian\User from 157.57.148.24 to NtDomain/User has failed:
   EcGetMailboxDN() call failed with error The requested mailbox is not
   available on this server.

   11310 MSExchange Pop3 Authentication
   The following error occurred: The requested mailbox is not available on this
   server.

CAUSE
=====

Either the Outlook Express POP3 client is not able to access the mailbox because
it does not exist or there is a custom recipient in the Exchange Server
organization that has the same alias as you do, and Exchange Server is
attempting to access the custom recipient before accessing your mailbox.

WORKAROUND
==========

In Outlook Express, try using Clear Text, which is the "Log on using" option
under the Servers tab of the mail account.

To do so:

1. On the Tools menu, click Accounts. This will bring up several tabs.

2. If you select any listed mail account, the properties will have a Servers tab
   with the "Log on using" option.

3. Select the Clear Text option.

If this works, then you were trying to access a non-existent mailbox or the wrong
mailbox. If this does not work, then the administrator needs to check for and
remove the custom recipient.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a user tries to log on to Exchange Server with Outlook Express and Secure
Password Authentication, the client will pass the credentials of the user logged
on to the workstation. If the logon works using the Clear Text option: <NT
Domain/NT Account/Alias>, the user will have to change his or her mailbox
alias to the Windows NT account name in order to use Secure Password
Authentication. This is because Secure Password Authentication will not pass the
mailbox alias information. It defaults to <NT DOMAIN\NTACCOUNT> and
Exchange Server assumes the alias to be the Windows NT account.
