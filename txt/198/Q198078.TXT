SYMPTOMS
========

When you protect a document for forms that does not contain form fields or
unprotected sections, nothing happens when you click the Go To command on the
Edit menu, even though the command is available.

NOTE: To protect a document, click Protect Document on the Tools menu.

CAUSE
=====

When you protect your document for forms, the document must contain at least one
unprotected section or form field for the Go To feature to work. The Go To
feature will not go to a protected section that does not contain at least one
form field.
