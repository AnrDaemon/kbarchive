KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsmsInst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0

SUMMARY
=======

When inserting the script item "Radio Button" dialog box in the Systems
Management Server Installer Script Editor, it employs an existing dialog box
template. The Radio Button dialog box settings window will allow you to insert
more text than the default templates can display. If you need a custom dialog
box to display a long string of text you can create a new Custom Dialog Box or
you can copy and modify the existing templates.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Create your own custom dialog boxes and copy and modify any of the nineteen
Installer dialog box templates. The Installation Expert uses eleven of these
templates to create the installation wizards. The others are used by various
script items such as the Radio Button Dialog Box. You can find Installer
templates in the \dialogs\template directory of your main Installer directory.

If you copy the templates to another directory, you must change the Dialogs
Directory on the Installation Properties Settings page. This tells the compiler
where to get the templates, if you edit the templates in the \dialogs\template
directory, then back up the files to another directory for recovery. If you edit
the templates in the \dialogs\template directory, then back up the files to
another directory for recovery.

NOTE: The list of templates found when you select Dialog Templates from the Edit
menu is a static list that does not represent the current contents of the
\dialogs\template directory or the Dialogs Directory on the Installation
Properties Settings page.

To create or edit a custom dialog box in the Installer Script Editor select the
Custom Dialog script item to launch the Custom Dialog Editor. Within the editor
you can open an existing dialog template as a *.dlg file or create a new one and
save it as a *.dlg file to use again.

To edit a Custom Dialog template follow the preceding procedures or within the
Installer Script Editor and select Dialog Templates from the Edit Menu.
