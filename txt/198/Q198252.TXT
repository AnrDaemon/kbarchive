KEYWORDS:kbVBp kbVBp500 kbVBp500bug kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a setup program for your Visual Basic application using the setup
wizard in Visual Basic 5.0 and then install it on a target computer, which uses
either Windows NT 4.0 SP3, Windows NT 4.0 SP4, or Windows 95 as the operating
system, the following errors may occur:

   The ordinal 401 could not be located in the dynamic link library
   OLEAUT32.dll.

   -or-

   Invalid procedure call or argument, An unexpected setup error has occurred!

CAUSE
=====

There is a version mismatch with the Msvbvm50.dll file. The following version of
the Msvbvm50.dll file causes this error:

   File Name        Date         Version       Size
   -----------------------------------------------------
   Msvbvm50.dll     11/18/97     6.0.73.22     1340688

This version of the Msvbvm50.dll file ships with the following book by Sybex:

   MCSD: SQL Server 6.5 Database Design Study Guide
   By Kevin Hough
   ISBN: 0-7821-2269-8

The Sybex software contains a non-release beta version of the Visual Basic
run-time DLL, Msvbvm50.dll (version 6.00.73.22). Because the version number is
higher than any other released versions of the Msvbvm50.dll file, it will
replace any existing Msvbvm50.dll file on the target computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Unregister the Msvbvm50.dll file and remove it on both the development
   computer and the target computer.

   To unregister the Msvbvm50.dll file, use the Regsvr32.exe utility. The
   Msvbvm50.dll file resides in the Windows system directory. For example, on
   Windows NT enter the following line using the Start/Run menu option:

   regsvr32 /u C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\MSVBVM50.DLL

   When the Msvbvm50.dll file is successfully unregistered, delete or rename it
   from the Windows system directory.

2. Download the Msvbvm50.exe file from the Microsoft Web site as specified in
   the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

   Q180071 : FILE: Msvbvm50.exe Installs Visual Basic 5.0 Run-Time Files

3. Run the Msvbvm50.exe file on the development computer.

4. Recreate the setup program for your application.
