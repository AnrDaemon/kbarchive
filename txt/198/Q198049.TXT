SYMPTOMS
========

When you convert a WordPerfect 6.x or 7.x document containing two tables that
are positioned one above the another with no space between them (called "back to
back" in WordPerfect), they appear in Word with a slight space between the two
borders of the tables.

CAUSE
=====

In the conversion process, Word duplicates the WordPerfect "back to back"
feature by inserting a hidden paragraph mark between the two tables.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In WordPerfect, tables can be inserted back to back (one on top of the other)
and still be separate tables until selected and merged together.

In Word, there is no way to exactly duplicate the look of back to back tables,
except to merge the two tables. Word always shows a small space between the
tables.

When you save the WordPerfect 6.x or 7.x file as WordPerfect 5.1 and then open it
in Word, the hidden paragraph mark between the tables is removed, and the tables
are merged together.

Additional query words: merge double line back-to-back
