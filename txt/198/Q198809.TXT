TITLE   :XIMS: Invisible Users Become Visible When Joining a Channel
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When performing a WHO command from a Chat client to the Microsoft Exchange Chat
Service, when an invisible user joins a channel, that user is listed in the WHO
output. The client issuing the WHO command is not an IRC operator, and is not a
member of any channels.

STATUS
======

This is by design. When an invisible user joins a 'public' channel or is in a
common channel with the user executing the WHO command, the user will appear in
the WHO list.
