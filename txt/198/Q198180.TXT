-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If an SLI application makes multiple SLI_OPEN calls to open an LUA pool, and
registers a BIND routine callback procedure, the SLI application has no way to
correlate the BIND routine with the original SLI_OPEN request, when the
application's BIND routine procedure is called. The lua_correlator field
provided to the SLI_OPEN request is not provided to the application's BIND
routine.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server SLI DLL file (Winsli32.dll) was failing to provide the
lua_correlator field to the SLI application's BIND routine while an SLI_OPEN
request is being processed.

RESOLUTION
==========
