The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Cluster Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server

SUMMARY
=======

Applications not specifically designed to run on Microsoft Cluster Server can
become confused with regard to host names when set up as generic applications or
services. This confusion can occur when the applications make calls by using the
GetHostName() or GetComputerName() APIs. Typically, the application will fail
with regard to the node name as opposed to the cluster name.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Set the dependencies for the application to include only a dependency on the
network name to which the application needs access. Under the parameters page,
make sure that the "Use Network Name for Computer Name" check box is selected.
Selecting this check box has the effect of setting the environment variable
_CLUSTER_NETWORK_NAME_ for the context of the application. Calls to
GetHostName() and GetComputerName() return the value of the variable as opposed
to the host name of computer name of the node.

NOTE: This variable is ALWAYS a user variable. Do not attempt to set it manually
to be a system variable. Doing so can cause failures and, in extreme cases, the
inability to log on.

"Use Network Name for Computer Name" will be unavailable if multiple dependencies
exist. Set the dependency, click to select the check box, and add other
dependencies as needed.
