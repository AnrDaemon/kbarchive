TITLE   :XWEB: Mail Doesn't Get Sent to Contacts w/SMTP in E-mail Address
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Packs 1, 2, 3 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to send a new mail message to a Contact through Outlook Web
Access (OWA) and the Contact has "SMTP" as part of the e-mail address, a
non-delivery report (NDR) is returned and looks similar to the following:

   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

   To: 'smtp\:testuser@microsoft.com' Subject: test Sent: 1/4/99 7:28:04 AM

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

   'smtp\:testuser@microsoft.com' on 1/4/99 7:28 AM

   The recipient name is not recognized
   MSEXCH:IMS:microsoft:northamerica:RED-IMC-02 0 (000C05A6) Unknown Recipient

CAUSE
=====

When CDO/MAPI resolves the name or address, CDO/MAPI actually reads the address
type as SMTP:SMTP. The address cannot be parsed in OWA as a valid SMTP address,
and returns an NDR.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do not type "SMTP" as a part of the e-mail address
for a Contact in OWA.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Outlook client does not behave the same way because it will not allow you to
type a colon into the e-mail Address Type.
