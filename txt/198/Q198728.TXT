TITLE   :SMS: Cannot Remote Control Clients Using DirectX
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Remote Control session will fail if either of the following conditions are
true:

 - The Remote Control session is attempted from a Systems Management Server 2.0
   Administrator Console to a Systems Management Server 2.0 client computer
   while the client computer is running an application that uses DirectX.

   -or-

 - An application that uses DirectX is started on the client during the Remote
   Control session.

This usually results in an exception error in Remote.exe -- access violation
(0xc0000005) -- on the Administrator Console computer, causing the Remote Tools
session to be disconnected, but it may also cause the Remote Control viewer on
the Administrator Console to stop responding.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do the following:

 - Before attempting to start a Remote Control session, make sure that there are
   no applications running on the Systems Management Server 2.0 client computer
   that are using DirectX.

 - Do not start any applications on the client that use DirectX while in the
   Remote Control session.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
