The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the Depends.exe tool that is included with Microsoft
Visual Studio 6.0 and Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit Supplement 3 and
later. You can use this tool to assist in diagnosing problems with a particular
.dll or .exe file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Dependency Walker for Win32 (Depends.exe) is a diagnostic tool that that you can
use to determine which 32-bit program files are required to run a particular
program or load a particular dynamic-link library (DLL). The Depends.exe
features include:

 - The minimum set of files required to run a particular program or load a
   particular DLL.

 - Why a certain module is being loaded with a particular program.

 - The complete path for all the modules being loaded for a particular program.

 - The base addresses of each module being loaded.

 - The version of the file and/or computer type that it was created for.

Dependency Walker recursively scans all dependent modules required by a
particular program. During this scan it performs the following tasks:

 - Detects missing files. These are files that are required as a dependency to
   another module. A symptom of this problem is the "The dynamic link library
   Bar.dll could not be found in the specified path..." error message.

 - Detects invalid files. This includes files that are not Win32 compliant and
   files that are corrupted. A symptom of this problem is the "The program or
   DLL Bar.exe is not a valid Windows image" error message.

 - Detects import/export mismatches. The tool verifies that all functions
   imported to a module are actually exported from the dependent modules. All
   unresolved import functions are flagged with an error message. A symptom of
   this problem is the "The procedure entry point Name could not be located in
   the dynamic link library Bar.dll" error message.

 - Detects circular dependency errors. This is a very rare error, but it can
   occur with forwarded functions.

 - Detects mismatched computer module types. This occurs if a module built for
   one type of computer tries to load a module built for a different type of
   computer.

You can run this tool from a command prompt or from within Windows.

The syntax of the command is: depends.exe
