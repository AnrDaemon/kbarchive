SYMPTOMS
========

An ATL EXE with a singleton object doesn't unload from memory even after all
clients release references to it.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if your singleton class contains an inner object that
increments the module lock count. Consider the following code, where
CMySingletonComponent and CMyInnerObject are ATL "Simple Objects":

   class CMySingletonComponent : public CComCoClass<...>, ...
      {
      public:

         DECLARE_CLASSFACTORY_SINGLETON(CMySingletonComponent)
         CComObject<CMyInnerObject>* m_pInner;

         HRESULT FinalConstruct ()
         {
            return CComObject<CMyInnerObject>::CreateInstance (&m_pInner);
         }

         void FinalRelease ()
         {
            delete m_pInner;
         }
         ...
      };

An ATL local server doesn't unload until the module lock count goes to zero,
which in the case above never happens, because the CComObject<> contained
inside the singleton class above increments the module lock count in its
constructor but is never given a chance to decrement it in its destructor.

The contained CComObject<>'s destructor is called only if the singleton is
destroyed. The singleton is destroyed only if the class factory is destroyed.
The class factory in turn is destroyed only if the module lock count goes to
zero, which can't happen because the CComObject<> in the singleton is
never destroyed and doesn't decrement the module lock count.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use a class that doesn't increment the module lock count. You can use
CComObjectNoLock<> in place of CComObject<> for this purpose:

   class CMySingletonComponent : public CComCoClass<...>, ...
      {
      public:

         DECLARE_CLASSFACTORY_SINGLETON(CMySingletonComponent)
         CComObjectNoLock<CMyInnerObject>* m_pInner;

         HRESULT FinalConstruct ()
         {
            m_pInner = new CComObjectNoLock<CMyInnerObject>;
            ATLASSERT (m_pInner);
            return m_pInner->FinalConstruct();
         }

         void FinalRelease ()
         {
            delete m_pInner;
         }
         ...

      };

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
