PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbualink97 word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a CMYK (cyan-magenta-yellow-black) or a Joint Photographic
Experts Group (JPEG) formatted graphic into a Word document, the graphic may be
displayed as a box with an X inside it, or one of the following error messages
may appear:

 - Cannot open file.

   - or -

 - This graphics file may be damaged and cannot be converted <filename>.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Word 97 cannot convert CMYK JPEG graphics.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

Method 1:

Use a different JPEG format, such as gray scale or RGB (red-green-blue).

Method 2:

Use another graphics format that Word supports, such as Tagged Image File Format
(TIFF), Encapsulated PostScript (EPS), Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM), bit map
(BMP), or Windows Metafile Format (WMF).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The JPEG graphics filter (Jpegim32.flt) supports Version 6.0 of the JPEG File
Interchange Format (JFIF). You must have the JPEG filter to insert a JPEG file
into a Word document as a Microsoft Clip Gallery object or a Photo Editor
object. However you don't need the JPEG filter to insert a JPEG file directly
into a Word document.

The JPEG filter has the following limitations:

 - The filter does not support JPEG Tagged Interchange Format (JTIF) files.

 - The filter does not support cyan-magenta-yellow-black (CMYK) JPEG files.

For more information about other graphic filters that Word can use, click the
Office Assistant, type "graphic filters," click Search, and then click the
"Graphic file types Word can use" topic.
