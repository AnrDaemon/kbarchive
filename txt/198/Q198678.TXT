PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Content Expiration field in the HTMLA Web Administration can be set to a
date earlier than the today's date; however, you cannot do this in the MMC
interface.

CAUSE
=====

The Web Administration forms do not have a any validation for the Content
Expiration field. You can put in an incorrect date. This does not cause any
problems as long as you do not want the content to be cached in the user's Web
browser. If the date is earlier than the present date, it is implied that the
date is today.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Services version 5.0.
