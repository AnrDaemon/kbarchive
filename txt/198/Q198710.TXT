======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer versions 1.0, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Edit INI File script item in Systems Management Server Installer is used to
make modifications to an existing INI file during script execution. When using a
single script item to make modifications to existing values while at the same
time removing other sections of an INI file, the resulting contents of the INI
file may be incorrect.

Example of Script Item Settings That Can Reproduce Problem
----------------------------------------------------------

[Section1]

[Section2]
Valueitem=XXXXXX

[Section3]
Valueitem=XXXXXX

The results of this modification should be to remove [Section1] completely and
change the values of the entries listed under the other sections. Test results
have shown that this can actually leave [Section1] in the INI file and
transcribe the values from the following section back into the unremoved
[Section1]. To work around this problem, try either of the following:

1. Separate the task into multiple Edit INI File script items.

   -or-

2. Move the section to be deleted to the bottom of the Edit INI File settings.

WORKAROUND
==========

Server 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
