TITLE   :SMSINST: Script Item Text Must be Defined for Every Language
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.0,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms120 kbsmsInst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer versions 1.0, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When multiple languages are defined in Systems Management Server Installer, all
custom text labels for script items may be blank even though they were defined
within the script. This may happen if a script item with custom text is created
in one language, and then another language is selected. The text that was
defined for the script item may now be blank in the newly selected language.

CAUSE
=====

If you have not clicked to select the Copy Default check box on the Languages
tab in Installation Properties, SMS Installer does not populate the default,
custom text values to the other languages selected, and these custom text values
have to be entered in manually for all other languages.

If you have clicked to select the Copy Default check box, all of the script item
text, from the language in which they were created, are used in the script items
for the other languages.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To manually enter custom text values in the other languages, in the script
editor, click the desired language in the Language box, open the script item,
and then type in the text values. Do this for all script items that contain
custom text.
