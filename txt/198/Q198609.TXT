TITLE   :FIX: Write Statement Prints Double-Quote(")
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFileIO kbVBp kbVBp400bug kbVBp500fix kbGrpDSVB kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Write statement prints out a double-quote within a string field where this
should not be allowed.

CAUSE
=====

The Write statement is intended to work with the Input statement. A string field
is started and terminated with double quotes, thus placing a double quote within
the field indicates the end of the field.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you need to print out a nested double quote, you need to use the Print
statement.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Basic 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Insert the following code into the Form's code window.

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            Open "test.txt" For Output As #1
            Write #1, "Bob " & Chr(34) & "The Man" & Chr(34) & " Bulldog"
            Close #1
         End Sub

3. Run the project, then open the file, Test.txt, in Notepad. It contains the
   following:

   "Bob "The Man" Bulldog"

If you try the preceding code sample in Visual Basic 5.0 or later, it results in
the following:

   "Bob ""The Man"" Bulldog"

To achieve the results of Visual Basic 4.0 in Visual Basic 5.0 or later, use the
following:

      Print #1, "Bob " & Chr(34) & "The Man" & Chr(34) & " Bulldog"
