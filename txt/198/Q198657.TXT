SUMMARY
=======

If a new mailbox is created, and a user logs on to the mailbox using Outlook 98,
an offline store (OST) is created by default. If a Move Server operation is then
performed to move the server to another site, and the client profile for the
recipient is deleted and recreated, you must manually delete the old OST when
deleting the old client profile. Failure to do so will result in the following
behavior when you try to log on to the mailbox using the new profile and Outlook
98:

Outlook98 reports:

   Background Synchronization Error. See detailed logs in Deleted Items folder.

The following entries are found in the logs:

     1:05:34 Synchronizing Mailbox 'testuser'
     1:05:34 Synchronizing Hierarchy
     1:05:34       <#> folder(s) added to offline store
     1:05:34       <#> folder(s) updated in offline store
     1:05:34 Done

This error occurs whether or not the offline store was used with the old
profile.

Offline stores are created by default when a mailbox is logged onto the first
time with Outlook 98. Consequently, logging onto the mailbox using the new
profile causes the reported error to occur.

This behavior is by design.
