TITLE   :SMS: NDS Container Script Is Not Modified
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbNDS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The NDS container script is not modified.

CAUSE
=====

If the NDS container script has not been updated with the Systems Management
Server login script commands and the Site Settings-Client Installation
Methods-Logon Settings tab has been enabled from within the Systems Management
Server Administrator Console, this problem is most likely a rights issue.

WORKAROUND
==========

Make sure that the NDS account listed in the Site Settings-Connection
Accounts-Site system has proper rights to update the container and to modify the
login script.

Even if the account is made ADMIN equivalent, the account might be restricted if
it is also made a trustee of the container, but not given proper rights. If the
account is ADMIN equivalent it should be given the Supervisor OBJECT right and
the Supervisor PROPERTY right. To add appropriate NDS Rights, do the following:

1. Go into Nwadmin.

2. Highlight the container that will contain System Management Server systems,
   right-click on it and select TRUSTEES OF THIS OBJECT.

3. If the account shows as a trustee of the container (which would have been
   done manually), highlight the account.

4. In the OBJECT pane, click on the box to the left of SUPERVISOR.

5. If ALL PROPERTIES is selected in the PROPERTY pane, click on the box to the
   left of SUPERVISOR.

6. If you want to restrict the account to only certain properties, choose LOGIN
   SCRIPT in the SELECTED PROPERTIES section and enable Write as the minimum
   right required (refer to Novell Dynatext).
