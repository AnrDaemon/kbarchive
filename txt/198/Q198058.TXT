TITLE   :WD97: Word Truncates Your User Information Mailing Address
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you type your mailing address on the User Information tab and then restart
Word, Word may truncate your mailing address to 125 characters.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods.

Method 1: Limit the length of your mailing address
--------------------------------------------------

When you type your mailing address information on the User Information tab, limit
the length of your mailing address to 125 or fewer characters. To access the
User Information tab, on the Tools menu, click Options.

Method 2: Use an address book entry
-----------------------------------

Create a new listing in your address book for your return mailing address. This
address can be selected in the Word features that may require a return address.

NOTE: You may want to ensure that the mailing address is deleted on the User
Information tab. To access the User Information tab, on the Tools menu, click
Options.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Word allows you to store your mailing address information as part of your
default User Information. To access the User Information tab, on the Tools menu,
click Options.

The mailing address information you enter may extend up to 255 characters and
allows Word to use that information as the default return address for envelopes
and letters.

During the Word session when the mailing address is entered, Word uses the
extended mailing address information as usual. However, after you restart Word,
Word truncates any mailing address text that exceeds 125 characters.
