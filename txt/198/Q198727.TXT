SUMMARY
=======

Although the client-side Remote Control icon (Smsrc.cpl) in Control Panel is the
preferred method for changing client-side Remote Control settings, it is still
useful to know where the registry settings are located and what the default
settings are.

The following table includes settings for all the switches that direct Remote
Control features available for a client computer. In nearly all cases, a value
of 1 means that the feature is enabled; a value of 0 means that the feature is
disabled.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the changes to the settings are made using Control Panel Remote Control, the
new values are forcefully inserted into WUSER or WUSER32 (the running client
Remote Control agent). Conversely, if the changes are made to the registry, ONLY
WUSER32 on Windows NT systems will poll the changes and actively insert them
into the agent. All other clients must be restarted for the changes to take
effect.
