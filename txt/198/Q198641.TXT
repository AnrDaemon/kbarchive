SUMMARY

A message may appear when running the setup program for Systems Management
Server 2.0. The message states:

   You are using a Novell NetWare Login Box which may cause connectivity
   problems affecting Systems Management Server. It is recommended that you
   refer to the Systems Management Server 2.0 Release Notes (Readme.htm) before
   continuing. Do you want to continue?

This message appears as a precaution if the IntranetWare client is installed on
the machine that the Systems Management Server setup program is run on as some
versions of the IntranetWare client may cause problems on your site server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To reinstall the MSGina, perform the steps below.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Open the registry of the computer and go to the following location:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\WinLogon\NWGINA.DLL

2. Change Nwgina.dll to Msgina.dll.

3. Restart the server and run the setup program again.

If you choose not to replace the registry entry, there may be future problems
with the Systems Management Server Executive service not responding due to
remote procedure call (RPC) problems caused by the Nwgina.dll.
