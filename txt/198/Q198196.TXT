 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you paste a selection of several cells into Word using the Paste As
Hyperlink command, the contents of each cell appear as separate hyperlinks.
However, the entire object is actually a single hyperlink. For example, when you
display fields codes, you see something like this:

      {HYPERLINK "c:\\My Documents\Book1.xls" \l "sheet1!C2"}

Where C2 in this example represents the last cell in the range of data in
Microsoft Excel. Note that this is a single cell reference and not a reference
to a range of cells. This cell reference can point to any cell, A1 or Z255 for
example, and depends on the amount of data that you copy and paste.

CAUSE
=====

When the information is copied from Excel and placed on the clipboard, it is
pasted as one large selection. Therefore, when you paste this selection into
Word, it pastes as a single object.


WORKAROUND
==========

To create hyperlinks to individual cells in an Excel worksheet, copy and paste a
single cell from Excel to Word.
