The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a Word 97 for Windows document that contains Float Over Text
objects in an earlier version of Word, all of the Float Over Text objects are
converted to frames and an extra paragraph mark is placed after the frame.

CAUSE
=====

Earlier versions of Word do not support Float Over Text objects. When you open a
Word document that contains Float Over Text objects into an earlier version of
Word, the Float Over Text objects are converted to objects in a frame. When the
frame is inserted, an extra paragraph is inserted with it. This extra paragraph
mark can change the layout of your document.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do either of the following:

 - In an earlier version of Word, open the document and delete the unwanted
   paragraph marks (blank lines).

   -or-

 - In Word 97 for Windows, open the document and replace all of the Float Over
   Text objects with objects that are placed in text boxes.
