TITLE   :CHAT: Channel with Keys Set May Block Sysop
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you connect to a Chat Server through an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client
using the Sysop account, an attempt to type a channel without providing a
keyword may fail. This failure will generate the following error message:

   Cannot join channel.

CAUSE
=====

The channel is a persistent one, where ownerkey, and memberkey are set. In the
persistent channel, when the ownerkey is set, an owner may have created the
memberkey. Also, the system-wide SysopIsOwner flag does not apply to this type
of channel. It applies only to the dynamic channels.

Consequently, the SysopIsHost flag must be set on the persistent channel
otherwise the Sysop can only join as a member. When joining as a member, the
Sysop may be blocked from the channel if there is a memberkey set.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, set SysopIsHost on the channel.
