 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the Word Assistant, the Tips button may be unavailable (dimmed).
If the Tips button is available, clicking the button displays a tip. In the
Office Assistant tip balloon are Back and Next buttons. These buttons may be
unavailable.

This article explains why the Tips and the Next and Back buttons may be
unavailable.

CAUSE
=====

The Office Assistant Tips Button Appears Dimmed
-----------------------------------------------

When you click the Word Assistant, the Tips button is unavailable (dimmed) if
there are no tips to be displayed. Performing an action that causes Word to
generate a tip makes this button available. For example, to cause Word to
generate a tip, follow these steps:

1. In a new document, type "The word terst is misspelled."

2. On the Tools menu, click Spelling And Grammar.

3. Accept the word "test" in the Suggestions list of the Spelling and Grammar
   dialog box.

4. Click Change.

5. If the Office Assistant is not displayed, click the Office Assistant button
   (on the Standard toolbar).

6. Click the Office Assistant.

7. The Tips button should now be available.

8. Click the Tips button.

The Tips Back and Next Buttons Appear Dimmed
--------------------------------------------

The Back and Next buttons on the Tip balloon may be unavailable because there is
only one tip to display.

Word stores all tips generated within a session of Word. If at any time you want
to review tips generated during a particular session of Word, you can use the
Back or Next button.

When you quit and restart Word, the tips available in the previous session of
Word are no longer available, and the tips button will again be unavailable.
