TITLE   :XWEB: Chinese CHS and CHT Cannot Exist on Same OWA Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Pack 1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Multiple languages can be installed on a computer running Windows NT Server
using Outlook Web Access. The exception to this scenario is that Chinese
Traditional (CHT) and Chinese Simplified (CHS) cannot exist on the same server.

CAUSE
=====

The registry values that have to be modified to allow the correct character
interpretations and code pages are contained in the same location for both
language versions.

These values are contained in the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\MSExchangeWEB\ 
   AcceptLanguage

NOTE: The above registry key is one line; it has been wrapped for readability.

RESOLUTION
==========

Separate servers must be used to install the language packs for CHT and CHS.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
