PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:word97 kbwdinternet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you drag a hyperlink from a Word document to a Microsoft Excel workbook,
the hyperlink is lost.

CAUSE
=====

By design, Word uses Rich-Text Format (RTF) when you drag or copy text. Because
Excel does not accept RTF-formatted text, the hyperlinks are lost and you see
only the text.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the Copy Hyperlink command to copy the
hyperlink from Word. In Excel, use the Paste Hyperlink command. To do this,
follow these steps:

1. In Word, right-click the hyperlink.

2. On the shortcut menu, point to Hyperlink, and then click Copy Hyperlink.

3. In Excel, click the cell where you want to paste the hyperlink.

4. On the Edit menu, click Paste Hyperlink.
