TITLE   :WD97: Tabs in Tables Lost When Saving As Text with Layout
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you save a Word document as either Text with Layout or MS-DOS Text with
Layout, and the document contains a table that is formatted with tab stops, some
or all tabs that were in the table may be lost when the document is converted.

CAUSE
=====

When the Word for Windows document contains a table, the converter separates the
table columns by using a tab in the text file. The converter cannot handle a
right-aligned tab correctly. This tab is lost in the text file, and a space is
placed between the text instead of the tab. All other tabs are retained from the
table: table column separators, left-aligned, center-aligned, and
decimal-aligned.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
