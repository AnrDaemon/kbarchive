TITLE   :Combat FS: Converted FS98 Aircraft Use Incorrect Flap Sounds
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER::1.0

KEYWORDS:kbsound kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator: WWII Europe Series, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2: WWII Pacific Theater, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use converted Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 aircraft in Microsoft Combat
Flight Simulator or Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2, you may hear incorrect
flap sounds when you raise or lower the flaps of the converted aircraft.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because Combat Flight Simulator is incompatible with
Flight Simulator 98 aircraft flap sounds that use three cross-faded files.

NOTE: To determine if Flight Simulator 98 aircraft flap sounds use three
cross-faded files, use a text editor to open the Sound.cfg file for that
aircraft. If the file contains three [flaps] sections, the aircraft flap sounds
use three cross-faded files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Flight Simulator 98 aircraft flap sounds use three cross-faded files, Combat
Flight Simulator or Combat Flight Simulator 2 plays the default flap sounds for
the Messerschmitt Bf 109E aircraft when you raise or lower the flaps of the
converted aircraft.
