TITLE   :SMS: Courier Sender Must Run Local to Site Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbSender kbSMSSender

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Create Outgoing Parcel function in Courier Sender is only available when
running it locally from the Systems Management Server 2.0 site server. A Courier
Sender icon is present on remote computers running the Systems Management Server
2.0 Administrator Console and will run, but it gives the following message when
the Create Outgoing Parcel item is selected:

   The SMS registry indicates no outbox for the sender to scan. Be sure that you
   are running this application on an SMS Site Server and that at least one site
   is defined to use the Courier Sender.

WORKAROUND
==========

To use the Create Outgoing Parcel in Courier Sender, you must be running it
local to the Systems Management Server 2.0 site server. A possible workaround to
this is to Remote Control the Systems Management Server 2.0 site server from the
remote Administrator Console and run the Courier Sender in this way.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
