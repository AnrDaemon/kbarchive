TITLE   :XADM: Using a Batch File for Isinteg with Alltests
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The purpose of this article is to allow Exchange Server administrators to
schedule an Isintetg -fix -pri -test alltests to run during a specified time
without needing to input the 'y' at the prompt. Because information store
databases can be rather large, Exchange Server administrators may need to start
Isinteg -fix -test alltests late in the evening and be finished in the morning.
Using a batch file will allow Isinteg to run without user input.

NOTE: It is not recommended to create a batch file to run Isinteg on a regular
basis.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This method of running Isinteg allows the Exchange Server administrator to get
past the Isinteg prompt which states, "Press 'y' to continue to do all tests,
any other key to quit."

However, when you run the batch file, you may notice it sits at the following
prompt: "Press 'y' to continue to do all tests, any other key to quit," waiting
for someone to press 'y'.

In order to get the 'y' to be read after the batch file, use the following syntax
in the first batch file:

   "Isinteg -fix -pri -test alltests <y.bat" (without the quotation marks)

Create an additional batch file and simply enter 'y' (without the quotes) into
the second batch file. In the above example, the second batch file is called
"y.bat". When running the command there will be a slight delay but the 'y' will
be entered and Isinteg should begin to run.

Another way to do the same thing without using an additional file is to type the
following:

   "echo y | isinteg -pri -fix -test alltests" (without the quotation marks)
