SYMPTOMS
========

After you log on to an Exchange Server mailbox and access your mail messages,
the client may appear to stop responding (hang) for several minutes before the
user is able to continue working.

CAUSE
=====

The profile contains incorrect information for a server that the client
previously had need to connect to, and the server is no longer online or has
been removed.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, create a new profile.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem may occur because the server(s) that contained Site Folders was
improperly removed. Site Folders consist of the Off-line Address Book folder
(OAB), the Schedule+ Free Busy Information folder, and the Organizational Forms
folder.
