   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Calendar Connector relies on store notifications for
processing MAPI-based queries from Exchange clients. In certain cases, this
notification mechanism may stop, and require a restart of the Calendar
Connector.

CAUSE
=====

There is a problem with the store's push notification mechanism. In a heavy
stress environment, this problem becomes more apparent. This problem occurs more
often on high-powered Alpha-based servers than on Intel servers.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
To work around this problem, add a key to the registry. To do this, follow these
steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

   HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersSystem

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

   Value Name: Notification Timeout
   Data Type:  REG_DWORD
   Value:      1

4. Quit Registry Editor.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
