 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you merge documents that contain comments (annotations), some of the merged
comments may become mixed (scrambled) with other comments.

NOTE: To see the comments contained in a document, click Comments on the View
menu.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can add comments to a document without changing the document text. To insert
a comment, click Comment on the Insert menu, and then type your comment in the
comment window at the bottom of the screen. Word inserts a comment reference
mark in the document text and highlights the text you are commenting on. When
you point to the text, the comment pops up above the text.
