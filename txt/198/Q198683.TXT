KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Certificate Server version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a server certificate issued by Microsoft Certificate Server, the
following error may occur in Netscape Navigator and Netscape Communicator when
you connect to a secure Web server using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL):

   The security library has encountered an improperly formatted DER-encoded
   message.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because the browser is unable to correctly parse the server
certificate.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, correct the certificate by re-issuing the server
certificate and making sure the Distinguished Name (DN) uses only valid
PrintableString characters.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Most X.509 certificates use strings called PrintableString to represent text
information. PrintableStrings are strings of characters contained within the set
{ a-zA-Z0-9'()+,-./:=? } and the space character. Microsoft Certificate Server
is not restricted to using these characters however. If any part of the DN in
the certificate is not a PrintableString, then Certificate Server will use
another string type such as Unicode. The Netscape parser cannot understand
Unicode, and therefore, issues the above error.
