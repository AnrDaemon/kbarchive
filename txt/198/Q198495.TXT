KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Pack 1 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message in the Microsoft Outlook Web Access
(OWA) client when you attempt to open a message:

   Failed to open this message.
   Your message does not exist in this folder. It may have been deleted.

WORKAROUND
==========

If Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) is on a different system than the
Exchange Server computer, Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1 (SP1) will also
need to be installed on the IIS server. The OWA component installed on the IIS
server will then be upgraded to SP1.
