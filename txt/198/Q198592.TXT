SYMPTOMS
========

If a Microsoft Word for Windows document contains different odd and even headers
and footers and an odd page followed by a section or page break that is followed
by page numbering starting over at 1, a blank page prints between the two pages
where an even page is expected.

CAUSE
=====

Different odd and even headers and footers are often used for documents that
will be bound as a book. An open book has even pages on the left side and odd
pages on the right side. The blank page acts as a placeholder so that the odd
pages do not switch to the left side.

Blank page printing is by design and necessary for book binding.
