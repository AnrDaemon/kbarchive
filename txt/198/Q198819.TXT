TITLE   :Chat: CREATE Command Does Not Accept Capital Letters for Modes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Chat clients in IRCX mode will receive an error when creating a channel using a
capital letter for the mode.

For example, if you type:

   CREATE #channel L 50

The Microsoft Exchange Chat Service will respond with the following:

   Server 472 nick L :is unknown mode char to me

CAUSE
=====

The CREATE command accepts only lower case letters for the mode.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use lower case letters when typing the CREATE
command. For example:

   CREATE #channel l 50

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design, the MODE and CREATE commands accept only lower case
letters.
