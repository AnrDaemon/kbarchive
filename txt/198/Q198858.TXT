TITLE   :BUG: Cannot Do Inserts to Oracle Tables With Mixed Case Column N
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows

KEYWORDS:kbOracle kbRDO kbRDO200bug kbVBp500bug kbVBp600bug kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When trying to do an insert to an Oracle table, you receive the following error
message:

   Invalid Column Name

CAUSE
=====

The SourceColumn Property of rdoColumns is bringing back the incorrect column
name. It does not place the quotes around the column name as specified in the
statement:

   cn.Execute "CREATE TABLE mixed(""Col1"" varchar(20))"

This statement specifies quotes around Col1. In Oracle, this creates a column
name "Col1."

RESOLUTION
==========

Before trying the Insert, change the SourceColumn property to add the quotes
around the column name. For example:

   rs.rdoColumns(0).SourceColumn = """Col1"""

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start Visual Basic.

2. Create a Standard Exe Project.

3. Create a reference to Microsoft Remote Data Objects 2.0.

4. Place a CommandButton on the Form.

5. In the Command Button's click event, place the following code:

           Dim cn As New rdoConnection
           Dim rs As rdoResultset
           Dim q As rdoQuery
           Dim strConnect As String

               strConnect = "dsn=orac;UID=pss;PWD=pss"
               cn.Connect = strConnect
               cn.CursorDriver = rdUseClientBatch
               cn.EstablishConnection
               'uncomment below line after mixed table created
               ' cn.Execute "DROP TABLE mixed"
               cn.Execute "CREATE TABLE mixed(""Col1"" varchar(20))"
               Set q = cn.CreateQuery("bob", "SELECT * FROM mixed")
               Set rs = q.OpenResultset(rdOpenKeyset, rdConcurLock)
               'rs.rdoColumns(0).SourceColumn = """Col1"""
               rs.AddNew
               rs(0) = "alfka"
               rs.Update
               rs.BatchUpdate
               rs.Requery
               Debug.Print rs(0).Value

6. Run the Project, Click the Command1 Button.

   Result: You will receive the "Invalid Column name" error.

   If you uncomment the SourceColumn line, the code will work.
