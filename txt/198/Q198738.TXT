TITLE   :Probable Non-Windows NT Disk Error on HP NetServers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In certain circumstances, when autochk or chkdsk runs on an HP NetServer, you
may receive the either of the following messages:

   Errors found
   Probable non-Windows NT disk
   Continue Yes/No: No

or

   Checking file system on C:
   The file system is FAT
   Volume Serial Number is xxxx-xxxx
   Probable non-Windows NT disk
   Continue (Y/N)? No

"No" is automatically filled in, which prevents running the chkdsk utility on the
Windows NT system partition in write-mode. However, you may be able to run
chkdsk in read-only mode from a command prompt within the Windows NT GUI.

CAUSE
=====

There are two items that may cause this error condtion:

 - The HP utility partition was created prior to the Windows NT system partition
   and the HP Installation Assistant from the HP NetServer Navigator CD was then
   used to install Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 or 4.0.

 - The EISA utility partition has the correct partition type of 12, or FAT12,
   for partitions that are less then 16 MB. However, the HP Installation
   Assistant mistakenly assigns the invalid partition type of 12 to the Windows
   NT system partition.

RESOLUTION
==========

According to HP, this issue is scheduled to be resolved in the next release of
the HP NetServer Navigator CD for each HP NetServer Series G.01.65, F.01.40, and
L.12.05.

If the latest HP NetServer Navigator CD is not available, the only workaround is
to do an fdisk on the system and utility partitions. Run HP Configuration
Assistant in Custom mode and install Windows NT 3.51 or 4.0, which will create
the system partition before the utility partition.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem can be verified by using Disk Probe, a Microsoft Windows NT
resource kit utility, and viewing the Master Boot Record for hard disk 0, which
will have a 12 at offset 0x01C2.
