SYMPTOMS
========

When you apply a box border to two or more paragraphs where the first paragraph
has a left and right indent and the second paragraph has no indent, the top
border over the second paragraph is printed and displayed incorrectly.

The part where the top paragraph border touches the border of the second
paragraph is larger and darker than a normal border.

CAUSE
=====

A border has been applied twice to the problem area.

WORKAROUND
==========

Remove the bottom border from the indented paragraph to prevent a double border.
To do this, follow these steps:

1. Select the top paragraph.

2. On the Format menu, click Borders And Shading.

3. In the Preview box, remove only the bottom border.

4. Click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
