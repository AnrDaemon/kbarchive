SYMPTOMS
========

When installing or uninstalling the MSDN Library, one or more of the following
MSDN Setup error messages appear:

   RemoveCollection g_ccolCollection.Open(collectionname) dwError = 7

   -or-

   CloseCollection g_ccolCollection.Open(collectionname) dwError = 8

   -or-

   CloseCollection g_ccolCollection.Open(collectionname) dwError = 5

NOTE: Sometimes dwError has other values, but the same resolution applies.

CAUSE
=====

The file Hhcolreg.dat file may have been corrupted. This file is located in the
%WINDIR%\Help folder. By default this is C:\Windows\Help on Windows 95/98 and
C:\WINNT\Help on Windows NT.

RESOLUTION
==========

Search for all instances of the Hhcolreg.dat file on the machine. Rename each
instance of Hhcolreg.dat to Hhcolreg.txt. Attempt to perform the MSDN Library
install or uninstall again.

Note that all other HTML Help collections will need to be reinstalled after
performing this step. This includes, but is not limited to the following:

 - Other versions of the MSDN Library

 - Platform SDK documentation

If this troubleshooting step does not work, a manual removal of the MSDN Library
may be necessary before attempting the setup action again. For additional
