SYMPTOMS
========

Neither the Spelling command nor the Grammar command flags a single letter as a
misspelled word, regardless of case. For example, in the following sentence

   Now is the time f R all good men to come to the aid...

the spelling and grammar checkers do not flag either character (f or R) as a
spelling or grammar error.

CAUSE
=====

Word does not flag a single letter, because it is considered an intentional
action (for example, a heading of an index section). However, if you have two
single letters, such as f and f (separated by a space), Word flags the second
letter, regardless of case, because Word flags duplicate (repeated) words.

WORKAROUND
==========

The AutoCorrect feature can be used to change an entry if it is a typical
misspelling. For example, an entry of "t" can be automatically changed to "to"
from the Tools menu by selecting AutoCorrect and adding "t" to the "Replace Text
as You Type" dialog box.

NOTE: In the example of this article, you can create an AutoCorrect entry to
insert the word "for" instead of the f and a space; however, Word does not flag
"R" as a misspelling or grammatical error. There is no good workaround for this
type of problem.
