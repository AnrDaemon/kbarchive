SUMMARY
=======

When you install Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator, the files may occupy more
hard disk space than you expect.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The amount of hard disk space used by Combat Flight Simulator depends on the
cluster size of your hard disk. Many files installed by Combat Flight Simulator
are smaller than 10 kilobytes (KB) in size. On a hard disk with a large cluster
size, these files may occupy much more space than they need.

A cluster is the smallest unit of storage on a logical drive.

If the cluster size of your hard disk is 32 KB, a 5 KB file occupies 32 KB (one
cluster) of disk space. If the cluster size is 4 KB, a 5 KB file occupies 8 KB
(two clusters) of disk space.

For additional information about cluster sizes on a FAT file system, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
