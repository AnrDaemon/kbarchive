SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Outlook Web Access (OWA) client, you may encounter an error
message when trying to attach a large file. The size of the attachment may vary,
and the error can occur with different size attachments because of system
conditions such as resources, speed of the system, and so on. After selecting
"Add Attachment Now," the animated icon appears as OWA attempts to add the file.
Then the following error message appears:

   error 'ASP 0113'
   Script timed out

   /exchange/USA/Forms/IPM/NOTE/cmpAtt.ASP

   The maximum amount of time for a script to execute was exceeded. You can
   change this limit by specifying a new value for the property
   Server.ScriptTimeOut or by changing the value in the IIS administration
   tools.

After this error has occurred, the only choice is to close the browser window,
and restart OWA.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
