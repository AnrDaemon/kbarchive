======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server version 2.0 the Query Statement Properties window
will truncate text that exceeds 3,955 characters even though queries are
designed to handle up to 4,096 characters.

You can see an example of this behavior by using the following steps:

1. Start Systems Management Server Administrator Console and create a new query
   or go to the properties of a current query.

2. Click the "Edit Query Statement" button.

3. Click the "Show Query Language" button.

Note that you can view only 3,955 characters in this window. Queries that contain
more than 3,955 characters are truncated.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
