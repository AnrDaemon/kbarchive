TITLE   :Script Debugger Is Not Unicode Compatible
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using another language setting in Windows NT 2000, some characters may be
unreadable. A good example is in the Help/About dialog box. When you use the
script debugger under these circumstances, the dialog box displays question
marks instead of the proper characters.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the script debugger is not localized. There is only
one version of it and it uses ANSI characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Services version 5.0.
