SYMPTOMS

The mouse cursor disappears while either typing in the code window of a Visual
Basic ActiveX Control project or changing any property value in the property
window of a ActiveX Control project. This occurs if you are using the
IntelliMouse with IntelliPoint driver 2.0 or above.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the "Vanish When Typing" setting in the IntelliPoint
Mouse Properties dialog is turned on.

RESOLUTION
==========

Open the Mouse applet from the Control Panel and select the Visibility tab.
Under Vanish, deselect the "Vanish When Typing" checkbox.

STATUS

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Install the IntelliPoint Software that comes with IntelliMouse.

2. From the Control Panel, open the Mouse applet.

3. In the IntelliPoint Mouse Properties dialog, select the Visibility tab and
   under Vanish, check the "Vanish When Typing" checkbox.

4. Create a new ActiveX Control project in Visual Basic. UserControl1 is created
   by default.

5. Click on the design window of UserControl1 to open the code window.

6. Start typing some code in the window. The mouse cursor will disappear as
   expected, but it will not reappear when you move the mouse.

   environment windows, click the Taskbar, or switch to another running
   application.
