TITLE   :XIMS: Incorrectly Formatted Channel Names Will Not Be Transcribe
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to transcribe new dynamic channels in the Microsoft Chat Service
MMC, the users who join channels with the incorrectly formatted names (%#[ASCII
255], %#[ASCII 251]) see abnormal behavior. When the user sends private
messages, the first channel will create a transcript file with the name %#, and
the first user will receive a message indicating the channel message is being
transcribed.

No other log files will be created for the channels, and any private messages
will be placed in the log files.

RESOLUTION
==========

If a channel with a normal name is created, it will transcribe normally while
these two channels will not be transcribed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Chat Service included
with Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1.
