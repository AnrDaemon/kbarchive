TITLE   :PRB: GetLineFromChar Method Does Not Function in VFP 5.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbActiveX kbContainer kbCtrl kbvfp500 kbvfp500a

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The GetLineFromChar method of the Richtx32.ocx control returns erroneous values
in Visual FoxPro 5.0x. This behavior happens with version 5.01.4316 and version
6.00.8169 of the Richtx32.ocx.

RESOLUTION
==========

Turn off the ActiveX control dual interface (VTABLE binding) by adding the
following line to the Load event of the form:

      =SYS(2333,0)

MORE INFORMATION
================

The GetLineFromChar method should return the line number containing a specified
character position. This method returns valid values when running under Visual
FoxPro 3.0b and 6.0.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form and add a rich text control to the form.

2. In the Init method of the form, place the following code:

         Thisform.Olecontrol1.text=REPLICATE("a",200)

3. Add a text box to the form and name it Text1.

4. Add a command button that contains the following code:

         CLEAR
         foundline=THISFORM.olecontrol1.getlinefromchar(THISFORM.text1.VALUE)
         ?foundline
         THISFORM.REFRESH

5. Run the form. In the text box, type the following values, and pressing the
   command button after each number:

   " 10
   100
   150
   15
   250" (without the quotation marks)

Instead of returning a valid line number you may see values in scientific
notation, date time values, the word .NULL., a blank value, or a memory
protection error may occur. The memory protection errors seem to occur mostly
under Windows NT, but they can occur under Windows 95 or Windows 98.
