TITLE   :Commands that Don't Automatically Mount Removable Media Disks
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER::6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

If you put a removable media disk in a drive and issue a command that doesn't
automatically mount it, DoubleSpace does not automatically mount it until you
trigger a disk change. For example, the following DoubleSpace commands do not
cause a DoubleSpace-compressed disk in a removable media drive to be mounted
automatically.

   DBLSPACE /DEFRAG <drive>:
   DBLSPACE /info <drive>:
   DBLSPACE /uncompress <drive>:

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, access the DoubleSpace-compressed drive before you
try to access it using DoubleSpace. For example, if your removable
DoubleSpace-compressed disk is in drive A, type "A:" (without the quotation
marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

If you have already typed a command that doesn't cause the disk to be
automatically mounted, do the following:

1. Eject the disk from the drive.

2. Reinsert the disk into the drive.

3. Access the drive. For example, type "A:" (without the quotation marks) at the
   MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

How ChangeLine Support Effects this Situation
---------------------------------------------

If you use the DRIVPARM command (in the CONFIG.SYS file) to disable ChangeLine
support, you can successfully mount the removable media disk by accessing it.

With ChangeLine support enabled (the MS-DOS default), after you insert a floppy
disk in drive A and type "dblspace /info a:" (without the quotation marks), you
have to eject the disk, reinsert it, and then access it (that is, type "A:"
[without the quotation marks]) to gain access to the compressed data. If you
have ChangeLine support disabled, you can force the floppy disk to be
automatically mounted by typing "A:" (without the quotation marks) and then
pressing ENTER-- even after you access it in a way that causes it not to be
mounted.
