SUMMARY
=======

Asteroids is a space game featured in Arcade. In Asteroids, you are in command
of a spaceship and your mission is to shoot and dodge your way through an
endless asteroid belt. To stay alive, you must blow up the huge floating
asteroids before they hit your spaceship.

Beware! When you shoot a large asteroid, it breaks into two medium-sized
asteroids. When you shoot a medium-sized asteroid, it breaks into two small
asteroids. Fortunately, when you shoot a small asteroid, it disintegrates. Keep
an eye open for large flying saucers and small flying saucers. They shoot at you
until you destroy them or until they collide with an asteroid!

MORE INFORMATION
================

All you need to know to play Asteroids is how to start a game, move your
spaceship, and fire missiles. The playing field is a black background strewn
with drifting asteroids, invaded by an occasional alien spaceship.

Starting a New Game
-------------------

On the Game menu, click New, or press F2. When you start a new game, Asteroids
resets your score to zero.

Flying the Spaceship
--------------------

Press the LEFT ARROW key or the RIGHT ARROW key to turn the spaceship left or
right.

To fire the rocket engine on your spaceship, press the UP ARROW key.

To escape into hyperspace, press the SHIFT key. Your spaceship escapes into
hyperspace and reappears in another part of the asteroid belt, but there are no
guarantees that you get there safely.

To fire your missiles, press the SPACEBAR. Only four missiles can be on the
screen at one time, so pick your shots!

Scoring
-------

The scoring strategy for Asteroids is simple: The smaller the asteroid, the more
points you get. You get the most points for shooting flying saucers:

 - Large asteroid: 20 points
 - Medium asteroid: 50 points
 - Small asteroid: 100 points
 - Large flying saucer: 200 points
 - Small flying saucer: 1000 points

Additional Scoring Information
------------------------------

You start the game with three lives (or spaceships). For every 10,000 points you
score, you get a bonus spaceship. Flying saucers can destroy and be destroyed by
asteroids, but you don't score any points when that happens. Asteroids displays
the High Scores list at the end of each game. If your score is higher than the
lowest score on the current High Scores screen, Asteroids asks for your
initials. You can add them using the keyboard or mouse. If you score 100,000
points, Asteroids resets your score to zero.
