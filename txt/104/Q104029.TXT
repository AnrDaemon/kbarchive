KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Extended characters are not supported in .MMF filenames in the following areas
of versions 3.0 and 3.0b of Microsoft Mail for Windows:

 - The Backup command on the Mail menu.

 - The Open Message File dialog box. (You can enter an .MMF filename with
   extended characters, or select an .MMF filename with extended characters from
   the list box, but Mail cannot open the .MMF file.)

 - Mail invoked with the /f parameter (that is, MSMAIL /F NAME.MMF, where
   NAME.MMF is a filename with extended characters). In this case, Mail cannot
   open the .MMF file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0 and 3.0b of
Microsoft Mail for Windows. The problem was fixed in version 3.2.
