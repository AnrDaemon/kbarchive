SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to set up Micrografx Designer version 3.1 or 4.0 for Windows, you
may receive the following error message:

   Alert! Not enough Space in Windows Temporary Directory! Setup failed!

CAUSE
=====

When you install Micrografx Designer 3.1 or 4.0, you may encounter an out of
disk space error message if the TEMP= line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file is directed
to a drive with less than 3 megabytes (MB) of disk space available. This occurs
regardless of the drive and directory specified for the Micrografx Designer
installation.

When Designer sets up, it stores information in temporary files that it places in
the directory specified by your TEMP variable. Micrografx has confirmed that its
installation program requires at least 3 MB for this purpose.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and make sure that there is a valid TEMP= line.

2. Ensure that the drive and directory specified in the AUTOEXEC.BAT have at
   least 3 MB of available space..

3. Reboot the computer and restart the Micrografx Designer installation program
   as specified by Micrografx.

Micrografx Designer is manufactured by Micrografx, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
