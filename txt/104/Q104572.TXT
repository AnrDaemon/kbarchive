MORE INFORMATION
================

Opening a directory listing of Picture Sets
-------------------------------------------

When adding a custom picture set in Microsoft Scenes version 1.0 under Windows
NT, you may have to double-click the desired folder (directory) twice, instead
of once, to open a directory listing of picture sets.

In the Scenes Wizards, when you are prompted to select a directory where the
pictures are located and you select (double-click) the desired directory, the
number of pictures available will be the same as the number from the last
directory. Double-clicking the desired directory again displays the proper
number of pictures available or a performed picture set, if available.

System Error: Cannot read from drive B adding a picture set
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you try to add a new picture set with Microsoft Scenes under Windows NT, you
may receive the following error message:

   System Error: Cannot read from drive B

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. From the Scenes menu, choose the Scenes Wizards option.

2. Choose Add A Picture Set.

3. When prompted "Where are the pictures Stored?," choose drive C.

4. Choose Next.

The above error message appears.

If you choose Cancel, Scenes will add the picture set correctly and continue as
usual.
