TITLE   :Executing REXX CMD Files with the LAN Manager AT Utility
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager

SUMMARY
=======

REXX was originally a VM/SP batch language used on IBM Virtual Machine (VM)
systems. It is shipped with LAN Manager for OS/2. Command files written in REXX
can be executed by the LAN Manager AT utility or can be run manually.

Here are suggestions for porting REXX applications to NT.


1. Copy the OS/2 1.3 (not OS/2 2.0) CMD.EXE file to a directory on your NT
   machine.

2. Copy the OS/2 1.3 (not OS/2 2.0) OS2\DLL\REXX*.DLL DLLs to a directory in the
   Os2LibPath statement on your NT machine.

3. Run the OS/2 1.3 CMD.EXE file.

4. Run a REXX script. The REXX file should be named *.CMD and its first two
   characters must be slash asterisk (/*). The first REXX file you run won't
   work. Re-run it and it should run correctly.

NOTE: Testing has determined that the PUSH and PULL commands generate error
messages.
