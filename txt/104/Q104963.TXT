SYMPTOMS
========

In a Windows 3.1 printing application, calling SelectClipRgn() with the second
parameter set to NULL to reset the clipping region to clip output to the printer
page does not reset the clipping region. Clipping on the printer device context
is still set to the clipping region specified in the previous call to
SelectClipRgn().

CAUSE
=====

The HP LaserJet II and HP LaserJet III printer drivers do not handle the call to
SelectClipRgn() properly when the hrgn parameter is set to NULL. Instead of
setting the clipping region to be the entire printable page (as it should), the
call has no effect and the previous clipping region is still the device
context's clipping region.

RESOLUTION
==========

Instead of sending NULL as the hrgn parameter to SelectClipRgn(), create a
region of the printable area of the page and send that region as the hrgn
parameter. This will give the desired effect of calling SelectClipRgn(hPrnDC,
NULL). The following is an example of how this workaround could be implemented:

      HRGN hRgn,hPageRgn;
      POINT pt;

      SelectClipRgn(hPrnDC,hRgn=CreateRectRgn(200,200,500,500));
      // .  .  .
      // SelectClipRgn(hPrnDC,NULL);
      // Instead of calling the above function, try this:
      pt.x=GetDeviceCaps(hPrnDC,HORZRES);
      pt.y=GetDeviceCaps(hPrnDC,VERTRES);
      SelectClipRgn(hPrnDC,hPageRgn=CreateRectRgn(0,0,pt.x,pt.y));
      DeleteObject(hRgn);
      DeleteObject(hPageRgn);

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
