-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator for the Macintosh, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using a monitor larger than 13 inches with a Gravis Mouse Stick, the
aircraft may "lag behind" or respond slowly to stick input. Additionally, the
aircraft control being used may not return all the way to center when the stick
is released. For example, if the stick is pushed all the way to the right, the
aircraft may continue to roll right even after the stick is released.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Gravis Mouse Stick control panel must be properly configured for a larger
monitor. Create a set of preferences with the SetMaker utility provided by
Gravis and then select that set in the Control Panel whenever Flight Simulator
is in use with the larger monitor.
