SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Draw version 1.0 in Windows NT, both the 47-color
(47COLORS.PAL) and 86-color (87COLORS.PAL) palettes may blank out after you try
to scroll the line or fill bars at the bottom of the screen.

RESOLUTION
==========

To redisplay the colors, click the individual color locations on the blank
scroll bars, or do the following:

1. From the Draw menu, choose Colors.

2. Select Edit Palette, and then choose OK.

The colors will return in the currently scrolled position.

NOTE: Once the bars are scrolled again (either direction) the colors will
disappear again.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.1 and
Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
