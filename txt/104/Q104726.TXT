TITLE   :DoubleSpace Restarts Your Computer and Loops Endlessly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

When DoubleSpace restarts your computer to increase the DBLSPACE.INI
MaxFileFragments setting (because your DoubleSpace-compressed drive is too
fragmented to mount), your computer becomes trapped in an endless loop.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when a DoubleSpace-compressed drive on your hard disk drive
is too fragmented to mount and you are booting your computer from a floppy disk
(typically in drive A).

DoubleSpace modifies the DBLSPACE.INI file on the host drive for the overly
fragmented DoubleSpace-compressed drive; DoubleSpace does not consider which
drive is the boot drive.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this situation:

1. Ensure the floppy disk drives are empty and reboot your computer.

2. When the "Starting MS-DOS..." prompt is displayed, press F5.

3. Run Microsoft Defragmenter (Defrag).

4. Restart you computer.
