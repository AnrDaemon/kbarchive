TITLE   :DOCERR: Q Edit Descriptor and % Intrinsics Not Supported
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Page 522 of the "Language Guide" lists the following as DEC VAX FORTRAN
Extensions supported by PowerStation:

 - The Q edit descriptor returns the length of the input line

 - Inline variable length formatting (i.e., I<ln>, where "ln" is an
   integer variable).

 - The call intrinsics %val, %descr, %ref, and %loc, which specify the method
   used to pass arguments to routines.

 - Specifying the filename for a unit in an environment variable.

This information is incorrect, and the above features are not supported by
Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS.

The Online documentation for FORTRAN PowerStation 32 contains the correct
information.

RESOLUTION
==========

Strike the following lines from page 522 of the "Language Guide" shipped with
Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0 and 1.0a:

 - Q Edit descriptor for FORMAT statement.

 - Inline variable-length formatting (for example, FORMAT ('I<test>'),
   where test = 5).

 - Call intrinsics (%val, %descr, %ref, %loc).

 - Unnamed file opens getting their name from an environment variable, rather
   than by query on the terminal.

Additional query words: FORTRAN-77 nofps ANSI
