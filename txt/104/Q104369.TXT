PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+, versions 1.0, 1.0a, used with:
    - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In versions 1.0 and 1.0a of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, when you use
another person's (user1) appointment book to create a meeting that includes
yourself, you may receive an incorrect message when you delete the meeting while
in user1's schedule.

If you choose not to book the meeting into your own schedule, when you go back
into user1's appointment book, delete the meeting, and choose to send a
cancellation message, you will receive the following message:

   Do you want to remove this meeting for yourself now?

Since you did not book the meeting in your own schedule, you should not receive
the message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 1.0 and 1.0a of
Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
