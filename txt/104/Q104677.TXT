TITLE   :BUG: H2INC Versions 1.0 and 1.1 Do Not Support _syscall
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:OS/2:1.0; winnt:1.0,1.1,1.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft C to MASM include file translator (H2INC) does not support
function prototypes using _syscall. When the sample below is translated, H2INC
produces:

   warning HI4820: ignoring function definition : _syscall()
   error HI2061: syntax error : identifier 'func1'

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in H2INC versions 1.0, 1.1, and
1.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 448 of the "Microsoft Macro Assembler Programmer's Guide" manual for MASM
6.0 and page 649 of the "Environment and Tools" manual for MASM 6.1 state that
_syscall is accepted; however, H2INC generates errors when it encounters
prototypes containing these keywords.

Sample Code
-----------

   /* Command line options needed: none
   */ 
   int _syscall func1 (int x);
