======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a backup tape and restrict the access to only the owner and
administrative accounts, you cannot access (restore) the tape under U.S. Service
Pack 2 from either the owner or administrative accounts. If you attempt to
access the tape, the following error message appears:

   This tape has been secured. You do not have the proper privileges.

CAUSE
=====

Prior to U.S. Service Pack 2, the security key was compressed in ANSI. In U.S.
Service Pack 2, the compression was switched to Unicode.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem you can reinstall Windows NT or remove U.S. Service
Pack 2 by using the Emergency Repair disk. Before choosing to use these
workarounds, see the Status section below.
