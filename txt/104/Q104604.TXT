Windows NT does not provide drivers for the Columbia Data Products SST
WD7000-FAAST and WD7000-FAAST2 ultra high-speed SCSI controller cards.
However, Columbia Data has made available an upgraded BIOS called SST
IV version 1.0 which has support for Windows NT and OS/2 2.x. This is
an $85.00 upgrade and is only available through Columbia Data
Products.

If the BIOS on the card is 3.36 or greater, another alternative is to
use the beta driver available for these cards found on Columbia Data's
technical support BBS.

The Columbia Data Products products included here are manufactured by
a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or
otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability, nor
does Microsoft support any of these drivers or cards at this time.
