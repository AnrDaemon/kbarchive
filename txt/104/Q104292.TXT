SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Dial-Up Networking 1.3 Upgrade includes the ability for Dial-Up
Networking (DUN) clients to connect to a Microsoft Windows NT Remote Access
Service (RAS) server using 128-bit data encryption. This article describes how
to determine whether your Windows 95-based DUN client supports this level of
encryption.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine if your DUN client supports 128-bit encryption, use the following
steps:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders. In the Named
   box, type "pppmac.vxd" (without the quotation marks), and then click Find
   Now.

2. In the list of found files, right-click the Pppmac.vxd file in the
   Windows\System folder, and then click Properties.

3. Click the Version tab.

4. In the Item Name box, click Internal Name. If your computer is capable of
   using 128-bit encryption, the text in the Value box displays:

   PPPMAC (US/Canada Only, Not for Export)
