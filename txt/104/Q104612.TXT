SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Arcade includes Centipede, a game that takes you to a magical mushroom
patch. All you want to do is take a nap but the local insects mount an attack to
disturb your peace. Your only defense is the bug zapper, and you'll need it to
fight off the relentless centipedes, falling fleas, pouncing spiders, and
poisonous scorpions.

Don't let centipedes, fleas, or spiders touch your bug zapper. An insect
collision costs you one life. Beware of the scorpion! It poisons every mushroom
that it runs over, and if a centipede touches a poisoned mushroom, it tumbles
straight to the bottom of the house. Be prepared - each level of play is more
challenging.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use your mouse to position the bug zapper and click the left mouse button to
fire. The playing area consists of a black background populated with
multicolored insects and mushrooms.

Starting a New Game
-------------------

On the Game menu, click New, or press F2. When you start a new game, Centipede
resets your score to zero.

Aiming and Firing the Bug Zapper
--------------------------------

Use your mouse to position the bug zapper. Click the left mouse button to fire.

Scoring
-------

In Centipede, everything on the screen is fair game.

 - Mushroom: 1 point
 - Centipede body segment: 10 points
 - Centipede head: 100 points
 - Flea: 200 points
 - Spider: 300, 600, or 900 points
 - Scorpion: 1,000 points

Scoring Bonus Points
--------------------

Each time a bug zapper is destroyed, Centipede repairs the mushroom patch,
restores all poisoned and partially destroyed mushrooms, and awards bonus
points:

 - Poisoned mushroom: 5 points
 - Partially destroyed mushroom: 5 points

Additional Scoring Information
------------------------------

You start the game with three lives (or bug zappers). For every 12,000 points you
score, you get a bonus bug zapper so you can play longer. Spiders can destroy
mushrooms, but you don't score any points when this happens. At the end of each
game, Centipede displays the High Scores screen. If your score is higher than
the lowest score on the current High Scores screen, Centipede asks for your
initials. You can add them using the keyboard or mouse. If you score one million
points, Centipede resets your score to zero.
