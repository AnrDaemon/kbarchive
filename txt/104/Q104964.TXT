-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Arcade for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The games provided in Microsoft Arcade may stop responding (hang) if you use the
16-bit UltraSound sound card manufactured by Advanced Gravis Computer Technology
Ltd. with the default settings.

RESOLUTION
==========

To solve this problem, try one of the following solutions.

Solution 1
----------

Upgrade to the most recent version of the Gravis UltraSound driver that corrects
this problem. To obtain the driver, call the Advanced Gravis Bulletin Board
Service at (604) 431-5927. The filename is GUS0035.ZIP.

Solution 2
----------

This problem can also be solved by opening WAVEMIX.INI from the Windows directory
and using a text editor such as Notepad to add the following lines to the bottom
of the file (include the subheader):

   [UltraSound Waveform Output]
   Remix=2
   GoodWavePos=0
   WaveBlocks=3
   SamplesPerSec=11

Save the file, exit Notepad, and restart Windows.

Sounds being played by the games may have a slight delay; that is, you will see
an explosion on the screen first, followed a split second later by the sound
effect. However, the delay in sounds should not interfere in anyway to the game
play itself.

================
