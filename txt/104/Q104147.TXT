TITLE   :PC Forms: Extended Characters Lost When Saving Forms
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,3.0,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With version 1.0 of the Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, when you save a
form that contains an extended character (such as an umlaut), the form may lose
the extended character.

CAUSE
=====

The function responsible for expanding the character does not convert the
records from CP850 (MS-DOS code page for multi-lingual keyboard sets) to ANSI.
As a result, the extended characters are lost.

RESOLUTION
==========

Non-English versions of Microsoft Mail for Windows must be upgraded with new
libraries to correctly support the development and use of E-forms. Disk 2 of the
Electronic Forms Designer contains upgraded versions of MAILSPL.EXE, MSSFS.DLL,
and MAPI.DLL for the German and French versions of Microsoft Mail. Upgraded
versions of these files for other languages will be available from local
Microsoft subsidiaries.

The files are provided on Disk 2 in compressed format. The French versions of the
upgraded files are in the INTL\FRN directory. The German versions are in the
INTL\GER directory.

For more information, please see the Electronic Forms Designer README.WRI file.
