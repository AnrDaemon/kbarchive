TITLE   :MakeSys Hangs or Creates Invalid Files, Causing System Hang
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

If Microsoft MS-DOS MakeSys (included in the downloadable version of MS-DOS 6.2
and 6.22 Step-Up) does not find a valid signature (FXPF) at the beginning of the
patch file, it displays the following error message

   Fatal error: MakeSys could not create the new <filename> file because
   it could not find the original MS-DOS 6 version of <filename>. For more
   information, see the README.NOW file in the directory that contains your
   MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up files.

where <filename> is IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS, or DBLSPACE.BIN.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when MakeSys is unable to create the new MS-DOS system files
because:

 - One of the binary patch files (DBLSPACE.BI#, MSDOS.SY#, or IO.SY#) is
   damaged.

   NOTE: If the patch file is severely corrupted, MakeSys may stop responding
   (hang).

-or-

 - There are too many files in the root directory.

-or-

 - One of the source files (DBLSPACE.BIN, MSDOS.SYS, or IO.SYS) does not match
   the file included with the MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2 Upgrade.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the patch files are corrupted, download the MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up from the
bulletin board again and re-run MakeSys using the new files.

If there are too many files in the root directory, move some of them to a
subdirectory so that you do not have more than 500 files, including hidden and
system files, in the root directory.

NOTE: To obtain a directory listing of all files in the root of drive C,
including hidden and system files, type the following at the MS-DOS command
prompt and then press ENTER:

   " dir c:\ /a" (without the quotation marks)

If your source files do not match the files included with the MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2
Upgrade, see the README.NOW file for instructions on replacing your MS-DOS 6.0
or 6.2 system files.
