TITLE   :MakeSys Fails to Find DBLSPACE.BIN If APPEND Is Loaded
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:msdos

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


MS-DOS 6.2 MakeSys (included with the downloadable version of MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up
and run by SETUP.BAT) cannot find the MS-DOS 6.0 DBLSPACE.BIN file if APPEND is
active.

This problem occurs when you have APPEND C:\DOS in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove the APPEND command from your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file and restart your computer before running MakeSys.

WARNING: If you run MakeSys from the root directory (instead of running
SETUP.BAT), your original system files (IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS, and DBLSPACE.BIN) are
overwritten. MakeSys places the updated system files in the directory from which
it is run. Running SETUP.BAT automatically creates a STEPUP directory and run
MakeSys from there, avoiding this situation.
