TITLE   :DBLSPACE /DEFRAG and DEFRAG May Exit Without Error Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

If your system is very low on memory and you try to run DBLSPACE /DEFRAG,
DoubleSpace may be unable to run and may not display an error message. If you
then try to run DEFRAG, it may start normally but exit unexpectedly when it
attempts to run DBLSPACE /DEFRAG. Again, no error message is displayed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when there isn't enough memory for DoubleSpace to display an
error message. The amount of memory at which this problem occurs depends on your
system configuration and the size of your DoubleSpace-compressed drive.
Typically, this problem does not occur if you have more the 430K of free
conventional memory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Run MemMaker to increase your conventional memory.

-or-

 - Use the Clean Start (F5) or Interactive Start (F8) key to load fewer device
   drivers and terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs before running DEFRAG
   or DBLSPACE /DEFRAG.
