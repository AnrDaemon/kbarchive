TITLE   :PC Win DOS: Return Receipt Automatically Assigns High Priority
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: MS-DOS 
 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you compose a mail message using version 3.0b or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for
Windows or version 3.0 or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS
workstation, and you mark the message with the Return Receipt option, the
message will also have a priority of High when viewed by the Windows client.

This will happen regardless of what priority setting you originally intended or
set.

CAUSE
=====

This feature is by design. Originally, there was a problem with the Windows
client when a user sent a mail message with both High Priority and Return
Receipt.

The high priority would be stripped from the message. A mail recipient would
receive this message and not know it was supposed to have a high priority in
addition to the Return Receipt (which always showed up). In such a case, a mail
recipient might ignore important mail messages without realizing it.


Additional query words: 3.00 3.00b 3.20
