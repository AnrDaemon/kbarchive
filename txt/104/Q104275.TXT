The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The version 3.1c Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks maintenance release
contains the following corrections and enhancements:

 - Increased server throughput performance. Version 3.1a introduced a delay in
   processing messages between servers. Version 3.1c corrects this problem, and
   additionally, increases the throughput of the server over previous versions
   of Mail. This enhancement will typically affect large-routed networks.

 - Inclusion of user-defined gateway recipients in the Move User feature of the
   Mail Network Administrator program. Version 3.1a included a new move-user
   feature. However, at the time of release, it would not extract user-defined
   gateway recipients.

 - Mail Tools server-rebuild process functions correctly. Version 3.1a Mail
   Tools could corrupt user enclosures.

 - The Mail server can now reside on a machine with a CD-ROM drive. The Mail
   server is now compatible with Apple CD-ROM driver software.

 - Correction of a Kanji printing problem from the workstation. Unless the
   workstation is printing to a Kanji printer, there is no need to upgrade the
   workstation to a version later than 3.1a.
