Output sent from FoxBASE+/386 to a port does not print. Moreover, trying to print
to a port from FoxBASE+/386 prevents that port from working properly for any
other applications. As a result, you must reboot the computer before the port
can be used again.

To correct this problem, you must reinstall FoxBASE+/386 using the Fox386.arc
setup patch file. This file is available in the compressed, self- extracting
file Fb386prt.exe.
