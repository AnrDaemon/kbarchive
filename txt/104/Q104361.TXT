TITLE   :PC Forms: Attach Defaults to WINDOWS\SYSTEM Directory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,3.0,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attach a file to the routing form included with version 1.0 of
Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, the directory listed in the Attach File to
Be Routed dialog box is the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory. This may be inconsistent
with other Windows applications, which default to the WINDOWS directory.

CAUSE
=====

When you launch a custom form, the MEFLIB.DLL file is activated and the current
directory is set to MEFLIB.DLL's location: WINDOWS\SYSTEM. When you select the
Attach File to Be Reviewed button, the resulting dialog box defaults to this
current directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 1.0 of Microsoft
Electronic Forms Designer. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
