TITLE   :PC Adm: IMPORT: Error [12] Displays Wrong Line Number
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.1,3.0,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Import mail administration utility (IMPORT.EXE) included with versions 2.1,
3.0, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks reports the wrong line number
when a transaction has an Invalid character in column 1.

As a result, IMPORT generates the following expected error

   xxxx IMPORT: Error [12] Invalid character in column 1

where xxxx represents what Import assumes to be the actual line number of the
invalid transaction.

CAUSE
=====

According to the DIRSYNC.TXT file on Server Disk 1, the error syntax above means
that the Import source file contains an invalid character. The transaction
listed before the invalid transaction does not get processed and modifications
to the postoffice address list do not take place even though that previous
transaction is actually valid.
