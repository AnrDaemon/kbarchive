KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, when you try to
implement Inbox Shadowing, the following error message may occur:

   Unable to begin inbox shadowing

When you try to move the Mail message file (.MMF) locally, the following error
message may occur:

   Mail failed to relocate message file

NOTE: For more information about Inbox Shadowing, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q96718 PC Win: Description and Use of Inbox Shadowing

CAUSE
=====

There are two basic causes of these messages:

 - Mail for Windows cannot open, read, or write to the user's ACCESS3.GLB file.

 - The user's data contained in the ACCESS3.GLB file does not match the user
   name the user is currently logged in as.

As a result, Mail cannot add the messages in the Inbox to the shadowing Add list
in the message store.

In addition, a corrupt .MMF can also cause the problem.

RESOLUTION
==========
