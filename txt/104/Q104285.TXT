TITLE   :Dinosaurs: Title Bar Is Wrong Color When Active/Inactive
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Dinosaurs for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The title bar of a window changes color to show whether or not it is currently
selected or active. In Dinosaurs, the title bar of an active window has a
granite pattern in dark tan or brown, while the title bar of an inactive window
has a granite pattern in pale tan. Occasionally, however, an inactive window may
have an active title bar, and vice-versa.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Dinosaurs version 1.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
