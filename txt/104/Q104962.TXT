SYMPTOMS
========

In a Windows 3.1 printing application, calling the PALETTEINDEX macro to select
a color when drawing lines 1 pixel wide results in the printer drawing black
lines no matter what color index was selected from the logical palette.

CAUSE
=====

When the PALETTEINDEX macro is used, a COLORREF value is returned. The
palette-entry index is placed in the low-order byte and a 1 is placed in the
high-order byte. When a pen is created with the CreatePen function and a width
of 0 (1 device unit) is placed in the nWidth field and a COLORREF value returned
from PALETTEINDEX is placed in the clrref field, the pen is always black. The
Hewlett-Packard (HP) PaintJet driver does not correctly handle pens with a width
of 1 pixel when a color is selected with PALETTEINDEX and the high-order word of
the COLORREF value is one (1).

RESOLUTION
==========

Instead of using the PALETTEINDEX macro, you can use the PALETTERGB macro to
reference colors in your currently selected palette. Sometimes, this may not be
desirable because you would have to know all of the RGB values of all indices in
your logical palette. In that case, you could use the GetPaletteEntries()
function to retrieve the RGB values of the desired logical palette index and
call the PALETTERGB macro with those values.

The following example of how you could implement your own PALETTEINDEX function.
This function performs the same function as the PALETTEINDEX macro, and works in
all cases on the HP PaintJet.

      COLORREF MyPALETTEINDEX(HPALETTE hPalette, WORD wPaletteIndex)

      {
      PALETTEENTRY pe;

      GetPaletteEntries(hPalette, wPaletteIndex, 1, &pe);
      return (PALETTERGB(pe.peRed, pe.peGreen, pe.peBlue));
      }

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
