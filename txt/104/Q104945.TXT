The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation "Language Guide" describes the BEEPQQ
subroutine on page 214 as follows:

    BEEPQQ(duration, frequency)
         duration
            (Integer*4; input)   Length of the beep in microseconds.
         frequency
            (Integer*4; input)   Frequency of the tone in KHz.

The documentation on SLEEPQQ on page 496 is as follows:

      SLEEPQQ(duration)
         duration
            (Integer*4; input)   The number of microseconds to sleep (delay
                                 program execution).

The above information is incorrect. The arguments for BEEPQQ are in the wrong
order. The duration should be in milliseconds and the frequency in hertz (Hz).
The online help for these two run-time subroutines is correct.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make the following modifications on page 214 of your documentation:

    
      BEEPQQ(frequency, duration)
         frequency
            (Integer*4; input)    Frequency of the tone in Hz.
         duration
            (Integer*4; input)    Length of the beep in milliseconds.

      Remarks
         BEEPQQ does not return before the sound terminates.

Similarly, page 496 should be modified to reflect the following:

      SLEEPQQ(duration)
         duration
            (Integer*4; input)    The number of milliseconds to sleep (delay
                                  program execution).

Sample Code
-----------

   C No compiler options required
          include 'flib.fi'
          include 'flib.fd'
          print *, 1
          call beepqq(262,1000)
          print *, 2
          call sleepqq(1000)
          print *, 3
          end
