TITLE   :SFM: Macintosh Locked Folders Are Not Completely Secure
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you either set the Read-Only file attribute or "lock" a folder from a
Macintosh computer on a Services for Macintosh (SFM) shared subdirectory, you
cannot drag files or folders from the same SFM volume to the locked folder.
However, you can copy any other file from any other subdirectory (folder) on the
SFM server, copy files from a different SFM server, or copy files from the local
Macintosh hard drive to the locked folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To approximate a locked folder using SFM on a Windows NT Advanced Server
computer, set the NTFS permissions for the desired subdirectory (folder) to
Read-Only.

For more information on setting permissions on SFM volumes, please refer to the
Windows NT Advanced Server Services for Macintosh guide.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem was corrected in the latest U.S.
Service Pack for Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1. For
