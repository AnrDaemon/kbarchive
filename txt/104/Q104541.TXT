TITLE   :PC Tools SI Doesn't See Automounted DoubleSpace Floppy Disk
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

The PC Tools SI utility does not display information for an automatically mounted
DoubleSpace-compressed floppy disk.

When PC Tools SI reads the floppy disk, it is mounted, but the Automount code
confuses the application.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, run PC Tools SI twice or mount the floppy disk
before you run PC Tools SI.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PC Tools SI is manufactured by Central Point Software, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
