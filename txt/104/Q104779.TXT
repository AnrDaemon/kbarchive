======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Windows Undelete or the MS-DOS-based version of Undelete
on a LANtastic server, you receive the following error message:

   Disk drive failed - could not perform operation.

CAUSE
=====

You cannot use Undelete on a local drive if LANtastic is running in server mode
because all local drives are viewed as network drives.

RESOLUTION
==========

To run Undelete, disable the server service by typing "REM" (without the
quotation marks) and "space" (without the quotation marks) in front of the
server command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and then restarting the computer.
