-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following options are unavailable (grayed out) if you configure Microsoft
Backup for MS-DOS or Microsoft Backup for Windows to back up to an MS-DOS path
instead of a specific drive:

 - Prompt Before Overwriting Used Diskettes

 - Always Format Diskettes

The Use Error Correction On Diskettes option is grayed out under Microsoft
Backup, but is unavailable under Microsoft Backup for Windows.

Setting the Backup To option to a specific drive rather than the MS-DOS Path
makes these options available.

Additional query words: 6.00 can't backup drive-path dimmed greyed out mwbackup msbackup 6.20
