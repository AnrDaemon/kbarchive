======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have any commands in your CONFIG.SYS file for device drivers containing
the text "XLOAD," MemMaker removes them.

CAUSE
=====

MemMaker used XLOAD as an internal keyword and does not correctly deal with
device drivers using that keyword.

RESOLUTION
==========

You may be able to work around this problem by renaming the device driver. For
more information, contact the hardware or software vendor that supplied the
device driver.
