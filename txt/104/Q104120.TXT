SYMPTOMS
========

ALT+T is a hotkey you can use in the Find dialog box to type the name of the
item for which you want to search. If you press ALT+T while you are
simultaneously scrolling down with the mouse in the Find dialog box, the list
will continue to scroll down by itself until it reaches the last entry
("zustand" in Schubert, "zoo" in Stravinsky and "writers" in Mozart), or you
click an item with your mouse, or you close the dialog box.

After this, in Stravinsky and Mozart, if you move the mouse pointer over the
items in the list, they will each become highlighted as the pointer passes over
them. In other words, pressing ALT+T while scrolling with the mouse makes the
Find dialog box subsequently behave as though you were pressing the mouse button
all the time.

Closing and reopening the Find dialog box returns the mouse pointer behavior to
normal.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Stravinsky and Mozart version
1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
