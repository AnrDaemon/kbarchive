The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In versions 3.0x and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, it is sometimes
necessary to re-create or reset the .KEY and .MBG files. This article describes
the process.

NOTE: Before you make any modifications to the files, make copies of them
(*.OLD). Use the .OLD files to restore if something goes wrong and to track down
possibly orphaned .MAI files, if needed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: An easier way to reset the .KEY and .MBG files can be done with
MAILQ16.EXE. For more information on how to run MAILQ16.EXE, refer to the
following article in the Knowledge Base:

   Q130285 Resetting or Rebuilding Mailbags with MAILQ16.EXE

In the following examples, substitute the filenames of the appropriate .KEY and
.MBG files for the INQUEUE.KEY and INQUEUE.MBG that were used as examples.

To create a new .KEY file
-------------------------

   debug INQUEUE.KEY
   -rcx
   CX 0000
   :230
   -f100,32f,0
   -w
   -q

To reset a .KEY file
--------------------

   debug INQUEUE.KEY
   -f100,32f,0
   -w
   -q

To create/reset an .MBG file
----------------------------

   M:\MBG> type nul > INQUEUE.MBG

NOTE: You can verify that the file was created by using the MS-DOS DIR command to
check for the existence of a zero-byte INQUEUE.MBG file.
