TITLE   :Changing the Computer Name of a Windows NT Advanced Server

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changing computer names for Windows NT Advanced Server can only be
done after the computer is synchronized.

To change the name of a Controller or Server for Windows NT Advanced
Server, do the following:

1. Create a new Server Account with Server Manager on the Controller.

2. From the computer that needs the computer name changed, change the name to
   the new name.

   The administrator will receive a message warning "Changing the computer name
   without the domain administrator first changing its name on the domain will
   result in domain accounts not being able to access or log on to this
   computer. Are you sure?"

   Choose Yes (if the computer account has been created on the Controller).

3. Shut down and restart the Server with the name change.

4. When you log on, you will receive the message "At least one service or driver
   failed during system startup."

   The event log will show that netlogon failed because it "Failed to
   authenticate with the controller, a Windows NT Advanced Server for domain
   XXXX" Event ID = 3210. Data code C0000022 Status_Access_Denied."

   The administrator should start the Server Manager on the computer on which the
   name was changed. The old computer name appears highlighted and the new name
   is still unavailable (grayed out). This is a browser problem and has nothing
   to do with netlogon failing to start on this computer.

5. Select the new computer name that is unavailable and select Synchronize With
   Domain Controller. At this point, it will start netlogon and synchronize the
   database with the Controller correctly and the computer name will now be
   highlighted in Server Manager.

6. Delete the old computer (machine) account.
