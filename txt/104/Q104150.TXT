The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Multimedia Mozart for Windows, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Multimedia Schubert for Windows, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Multimedia Stravinsky for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may find that the screen paging does not keep up with the music when you
choose the Play Through button in the section "A Close Reading." This occurs in
low memory situations, when Schubert, Stravinsky, or Mozart cannot redraw pages
quickly enough to remain synchronized with the music.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, maximize available memory and system resources by closing
any unnecessary applications or utilities. If this does not work, try restarting
your system and rerunning Windows without any unnecessary
terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) or memory-resident utilities running.
