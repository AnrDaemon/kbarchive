TITLE   :Cannot Uncompress Some Floppy Disks Without Removing Data
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

If you compress a floppy disk and immediately try to uncompress the disk, you may
receive the following error message:

   DoubleSpace cannot uncompress drive <letter> because there is not
   enough space on drive <host letter> to hold all of the uncompressed
   files.

   To uncompress drive <letter>, you must remove at least <xxx,xxx>
   bytes of files from either drive.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs because DoubleSpace is very conservative in estimating the space
required to hold the uncompressed files. The estimate is based in part on a
worst-case scenario in which the data on the floppy disk is stored at a 16:1
compression ratio and DoubleSpace must convert the drive from a 16-bit file
allocation table (FAT) to a 12-bit FAT.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, remove <xxx,xxx> bytes of data from either
the compressed drive or the host drive.
