SYMPTOMS
========

You can run a slide show in Dinosaurs that randomly displays different screens
and parts of the program. To start a slide show, click Options and then click
Slide Show. To stop a slide show, click anywhere on the Dinosaurs window.

The slide show may take several seconds to start. Also, there is no indicator on
the screen identifying when you are in a slide show and when you are not. The
screens look exactly the same as they do when you page manually through the
Dinosaurs application.

If you have started a slide show, be aware that it may take several seconds to
start and to change slides. Don't click the mouse unless you want to stop the
slide show.
