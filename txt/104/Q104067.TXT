-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 allows you to use the TP0/X.25
transport, the TP4/CLNP transport, or both transports. This article describes
how to set the TP0/X.25 transport in the EiconCard Redirector mode.

With this configuration, the EiconCard and OSI LAN Gateway software are both
installed on an EiconCard server computer. The OSI LAN Gateway DOS Workstation
software is installed on a separate computer that is used to run the X.400
gateway.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use this configuration:

1. On the EiconCard server, install the EiconCard and the OSI LAN Gateway DOS
   Gateway software.

2. On the Gateway computer, install the EiconCard and the OSI LAN Gateway DOS
   Workstation software.

3. On the EiconCard server, modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to set up the computer
   as an EiconCard server.

4. On the Gateway computer, modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to set up the computer
   as an EiconCard redirector.

Example 1
---------

The following example shows parts of the AUTOEXEC.BAT files when the gateway
computer is an EiconCard redirector. X25serv is the server name, mypassword is
the server password, x25redir is the redirector name, and four workstation
sessions are being supported on the redirector computer by the Eicon software.

On the server (the computer with the EiconCard):

   REM Starting LAN Manager
   NET START ...

   REM Starting X.25
   NABIOS SRV x25serv mypassword /12
   ECLOAD

On the redirector (the gateway computer):

   REM Starting LAN Manager
   NET START ...

   REM Starting X.25
   NABIOS RDR x25redir /4
   ECUSE x25serv mypassword

Example 2
---------

This example shows the AUTOEXEC.BAT files needed for the gateway on a Novell
NetWare network. Again, four workstation sessions are being supported on the
redirector computer by the Eicon software. Microsoft MS-DOS version 5.0 is
installed.

On the server (the computer with the EiconCard):

   REM Starting Novell with NetBIOS emulation
   IPX
   NET5
   NETBIOS

   REM Starting X.25
   NABIOS SRV x25serv mypassword /12
   ECLOAD

On the redirector (the X.400 gateway computer):

   REM Starting Novell with NetBIOS emulation
   IPX
   NET5
   NETBIOS

   REM Starting X.25
   NABIOS RDR x25redir /4
   ECUSE x25serv mypassword
