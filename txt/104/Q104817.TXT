======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to a Windows NT server with queue attached to a Hewlett-Packard
(HP) JetDirect card, print jobs may not be removed from the print queue. The
print job is sent to the print server, it prints, but the print job is not
removed from the queue.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior happens when Advanced Job Status is chosen in Print Manager. This
option should be turned off in most printers. To check the setting of Advanced
Job Status, do the following:

1. In the Print Manager window, choose Printer from the File menu.

2. Choose Properties.

3. From the Print To menu, choose Network Printer.

4. Select Hewlett-Packard Network Port, and then choose the Port option.

When the Advanced Job Status is chosen the job will not be removed from the print
queue unless the printer supports bidirectional communication. The queue is
waiting for confirmation from the printer that the job is complete. Most
printers do not have the ability to send the confirmation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The HP LaserJet 4 supports bidirectional communication. A LaserJet with the
Windows Printing System also supports bidirectional communication, but the
Windows Printing System is not supported under Windows NT 3.1.
