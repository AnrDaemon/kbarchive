======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to create a new custom message using the Browser application
included with version 1.0 of Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, you may
receive the following error message:

   Login failure.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur when the workstation is not connected to the postoffice.

If the postoffice is not available and you select a form from the Browser
application, an alert dialog box appears, followed by a prompt to work offline.
If you choose to work offline, then cancel the subsequent sign-on dialog box,
the above error appears. It is a MAPI error, not one returned from the Browser.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 1.0 of Microsoft
Electronic Forms Designer. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
