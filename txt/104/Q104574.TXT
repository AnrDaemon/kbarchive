The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows NT Print Manager may start minimized even if its Icon Properties
does not have the Run Minimized option selected.

CAUSE
=====

Print Manager, by default, has the Save Settings On Exit option enabled. If you
close Print Manager when it is minimized and this option is enabled, the
minimized position will be saved. This behavior is different from other Windows
NT applications, such as the User Manager.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent Print Manager from starting minimized, exit Print Manager while the
Save Settings On Exit option is enabled and Print Manager is arranged in the
desired position (not minimized). Once the desired position is saved, disable
the Save Settings On Exit option.

NOTE: If you make any changes to a Printer window in Print Manager, its position
will not be saved unless the option is enabled.
