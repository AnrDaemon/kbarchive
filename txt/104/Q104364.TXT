TITLE   :PC Forms: Message Displayed in Compose Form
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,3.0,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you read a message created using a version 1.0 Microsoft Electronic Forms
Designer custom form, the message may be displayed in the Compose form, rather
than the Read form.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because of a limitation in simple Messaging Application
Programming Interface (MAPI). The MAPISaveMail() function ignores the MAPI_SENT
flag, starting this chain of events:

1. The message is opened and the header has MAPI_SENT set (gMessage.Flags =
   MAPI_SENT).

2. The message is deleted from the message list (underneath).

3. When Mail tries to save the open message to its original Message ID, it fails
   because the ID has been deleted.

4. The form attempts to save again, using the same header and an empty message
   ID (to save a "new" message).

5. The MAPISaveMail() function ignores the MAPI_SENT bit and saves the message
   as a new/unsent message.

6. When the message is reopened, the form processes an Open command on a
   new/unsent message, and concludes that the message should display the Compose
   form.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, close all open instances of E-forms before you delete
mail from Microsoft Mail for Windows.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in simple MAPI from versions 3.0
and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
