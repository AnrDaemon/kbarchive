TITLE   :DBLSPACE /UNCOMPRESS Points to Zero-Byte DBLSPACE.LOG File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

When you have duplicate files or directories on your compressed drive and host
drive, you receive a message instructing you to read a DBLSPACE.LOG file when
you attempt to uncompress a drive. The DBLSPACE.LOG file may be a zero-byte
file.

CAUSE
=====

If the host drive has zero bytes free, the DBLSPACE.LOG file is created as a
zero-byte file when DoubleSpace tries to write the DBLSPACE.LOG file.

NOTE: If the host drive is write protected, the DBLSPACE.LOG file cannot be
created.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Run DoubleSpace, decrease the size of the DoubleSpace-compressed drive, and
   then run DBLSPACE /UNCOMPRESS.

-or-

 - Free up some space on the host drive by moving files to another drive and
   then running DBLSPACE /UNCOMPRESS.

Additional query words: 6.20 double space
