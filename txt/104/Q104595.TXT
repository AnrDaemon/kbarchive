TITLE   :TSR to Force Creation of Temporary Files in Current Directory
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager

======================================================================
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
===================

Some programs (such as Clipper '87) create temporary files using a standard
MS-DOS function (int 21h function 5A).

MS-DOS function 5A by default tries to create temporary files in the root
directory of the current drive. On LAN Manager 2.x networks, this means that if
the current drive is redirected to a network share, the user must have Create
and Delete permissions on that share.

Using the HOOK5A Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) utility alleviates this
requirement by forcing Function 5A to create temporary files in the current
directory.

HOOK5A can be found in the Software/Data Library by searching on the keyword
HOOK5A, the Q number of this article, or S14343. HOOK5A was archived using the
PKware file-compression utility.

The entry in the Software/Data Library includes the following files:

   Filename       Description
   --------       -----------
   HOOK5A.COM     MS-DOS TSR program
   README.TXT     Short explanation of the program

USAGE

Load HOOK5A before or after the NET START RDR command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.

Note: As with any other TSR, if you load HOOK5A after you start the workstation
(NET START RDR), you will no longer be able to stop the workstation software.
