The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Multimedia Mozart for Windows, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Multimedia Schubert for Windows, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Multimedia Stravinsky for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you click the Previous and Next (<< and >>) buttons very quickly,
Schubert, Stravinsky or Mozart may not be able to retain and act upon all of
your mouse clicks. It takes time for Schubert, Stravinsky and Mozart to draw new
screens; if you try to progress to new pages faster than it can keep up, some of
your mouse clicks will be lost. This may occur even if the button appears to
depress each time you click it.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this, click more slowly on the Previous and Next buttons.
