The following procedure outlines the steps to remove an unwanted
workgroup postoffice (WGPO) under Windows NT. This procedure returns
Microsoft Mail to the state it was in before running Mail for the
first time.

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

If you are running Windows NT 4.0, you can easily remove the post office
by simply:

1. Go to Control Panel.

2. Select Add/Remove Programs.

3. Click Windows NT Setup.

4. Uncheck the Windows Messaging check box.

Windows NT 3.x
--------------

WARNING: Back up (export) any mail you want to retain before proceeding
with the following.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Using File Manager, delete the postoffice directory and all subdirectories in
   it. The default name of the Windows NT postoffice directory is WGPO and it
   can be located in the root directory or a subdirectory of any available
   partition on the hard disk drive.

   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
   problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
   Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
   Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

2. Start Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE) and select the following subkey to
   highlight it:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Mail\Microsoft Mail

3. Press the DELETE key on your keyboard, or choose Delete from the Edit menu,
   and then press ENTER to confirm the action.

The next time you start MS Mail, you will have the option of
connecting to an existing postoffice, or creating a new postoffice,
and then continuing with the rest of the initial MS Mail setup.
