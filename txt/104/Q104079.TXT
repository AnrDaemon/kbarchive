PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the version 3.0 or 3.2 Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Administrator
program (ADMIN.EXE) to print a report of the public folders (group and shared
folders), the following error message may be displayed:

   Notice 27: Disk directory full or error writing to disk

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when the FOLDROOT.IDX file in the FOLDERS\PUB subdirectory of
the Mail database is corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, restore the file from a backup copy. However, if a
backup copy is not available, you can run the FIXIDX utility to build the
FOLDROOT.IDX file from the folder files. However, this will result in the loss
of folder names and will also transfer ownership of all folders to the person
specified in the FIXIDX command line.

The FIXIDX.EXE utility is available as part of the Database Maintenance Utilities
document. To obtain the document containing the Database Maintenance Utilities,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
