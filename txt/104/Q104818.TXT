TITLE   :PC Forms: Message Class Not Preserved When Forwarding
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,3.0,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a message created with version 1.0 of Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer
is forwarded from a version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 Microsoft Mail for Windows user
who does not have E-Forms installed, the message arrives as a text message with
the following error message:

   Displaying this message correctly requires a custom E-Form that is not
   available, or is incorrectly installed. Please contact your network
   administrator for more information.

CAUSE
=====

The message class is not preserved when a message is forwarded from a Windows
client that does not have E-Forms installed and that does not understand the
message class.

To the client that forwarded the message, the E-Form is a message of unknown
class. Mail converts the message to a standard note so the Windows client cannot
delete class-specific information from the message. Deleting the message class
definition causes the above error when the forwarded message is read.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
