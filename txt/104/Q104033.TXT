TITLE   :Uncompressed Removable Media Disk Files Displayed w/Host Drive
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you mount a compressed removable media disk, replace it with an uncompressed
disk, and then access the old compressed disk's host drive letter, the directory
listing of the uncompressed removable media disk is displayed using the host
drive letter.

NOTE: This problem occurs at the MS-DOS command prompt and in Windows File
Manager.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, do not access the host drive letter after replacing a
compressed removable media disk with an uncompressed disk.

For example, after using a compressed removable media disk in drive D (with a
host drive G), immediately access drive D (not drive G) after inserting an
uncompressed removable media disk. If you are using File Manager, you can simply
press F5 after switching disks.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS version 6.2. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 6.22 6.20
