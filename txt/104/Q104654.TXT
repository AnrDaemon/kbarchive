KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Dinosaurs for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Dinosaurs does not run under Microsoft Windows NT 3.1 in 16-color mode.

RESOLUTION
==========

You must use a video driver that provides support for at least 256 colors. You
will receive a warning message if you try to install Dinosaurs under Windows NT
3.1 while using a 16-color video driver.

Dinosaurs can run under Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 in 16-color mode. However, the
display quality is poor compared to 256-color modes. We recommended 256-color
displays for all Microsoft Multimedia programs.

To avoid this problem, you can either run Dinosaurs under Windows NT 3.1 using a
video driver that supports at least 256 colors, or you can run in 16-color mode
using Microsoft Windows 3.1x, Windows for Workgroups 3.1x, or Windows NT 3.51.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following information is from the Dinosaurs readme file.

Microsoft Dinosaurs was released before the final version of Windows NT, thus
Dinosaurs has been tested only on Beta versions of NT. There are two potential
problems with Dinosaurs running under NT:

 - There is no VGA support for Dinosaurs; if you are running NT, you need to be
   using a VGA+ or better display to use Dinosaurs.

 - The CompacVideo driver used for movies for NT 3.1 was not completed by the
   time Dinosaurs shipped.
