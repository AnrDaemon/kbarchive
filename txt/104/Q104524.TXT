SUMMARY
=======

MS-DOS Shell Help contains a syntax documentation error. It states that you can
specify the location of the DOSSHELL.INI file by setting a dosshell environment
variable in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. For example, if the DOSSHELL.INI file is
located in your DOS directory on drive C, according to the help file, you would
add the following command line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   dosshell=c:\dos

The syntax in the above statement is incorrect. This does not set the environment
variable. Adding this entry to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file causes Shell to be
executed, which stops AUTOEXEC.BAT file processing until you exit Shell. A
correct example for this line entry is:

   set dosshell=c:\dos

This entry only sets the environment variable to the DOS directory; it does not
start Shell (therefore your AUTOEXEC.BAT file is still processed). This syntax
can be checked by using the SET command at the C prompt to examine the
environment variables.

Additional query words: 6.00 dosshell dosshell.ini environment
