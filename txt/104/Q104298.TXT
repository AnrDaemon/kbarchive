TITLE   :PC MAPI: MAPISaveMail Function Resets Originator to Caller
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you save a message using the Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
MAPISaveMail function, the Originator parameter of the message is set to the
Mail user who logged on.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Visual Basic MAPIMessage structure does not contain an Originator
field like the C equivalent message structure does. Therefore, the actual
originator cannot be saved--instead, the logon user information is saved in this
field (when it is read by MAPIReadMail). The C MAPISaveMail function correctly
preserves the originator field because it is in the C MAPIMessage structure.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0 and 3.0b of
Microsoft Mail for Windows. This problem was corrected in version 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.00b
