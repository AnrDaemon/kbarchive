The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Multimedia Mozart for Windows, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Multimedia Schubert for Windows, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Multimedia Stravinsky for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Some elements in Schubert, Stravinsky or Mozart may adopt colors that you have
set in the Windows Control Panel. Items that may adopt the system colors include
borders, buttons, and text. If you set the window text color to be pale blue,
for example, some text items in Stravinsky or Mozart may be very difficult to
read.

Schubert, Stravinsky and Mozart are supposed to use only their own pre- defined
colors; however, some elements will incorrectly follow the system colors you
have set in the Control Panel.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Schubert, Stravinsky and Mozart
version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, use a dark color for your window text and a pale color
for the window background.
