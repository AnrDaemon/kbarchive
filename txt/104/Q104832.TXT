 - Microsoft Cinemania 1994 editions 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Some Cinemania keyboard functions do not work the way they are labeled. For
example, in the Topics Found dialog box, pressing ALT+P enacts Print instead of
Previous Match.


RESOLUTION
==========

Choose these options with the mouse.

NOTE: One of the system requirements listed on the Cinemania box is a "Microsoft
Mouse or compatible pointing device."

These problems have been corrected in Cinemania 1995. They also do not occur in
Cinemania 1994 when running Microsoft Windows 95.
