TITLE   :FIX: Functions Exported Incorrectly in MASM 6.1 WINDLL Sample
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::6.1,6.1a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.1, 6.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SYSDATA.EXE sample program supplied with the Microsoft Macro Assembler
(MASM) versions 6.1 and 6.1a displays incorrect data when run. (This assumes you
have already successfully built SYSINFO.DLL using the provided makefile,
SYSINFO.MAK.)

CAUSE
=====

SYSDATA.EXE was built with a different import library than the one created from
the SYSINFO files shipped with MASM. Therefore, SYSDATA.EXE does not correctly
call the functions within SYSINFO.DLL, which causes the program to display
incorrect data.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two solutions (described below) to the problem. If you have the
Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK), you can choose either
solution. The SDK is relevant because RC.EXE is required to build SYSDATA.EXE.
RC.EXE is shipped with the SDK and is not included with MASM.

 - If you have the SDK, you can rebuild SYSDATA.EXE using SYSDATA.MAK. This uses
   the import library produced from building SYSINFO.DLL--SYSINFO.LIB. When you
   run the rebuilt SYSDATA.EXE, the correct data is displayed.

 - If you do not have the SDK, you need to first modify SYSINFO.DEF so that it
   resembles the following:

         EXPORTS
                 GetSysTime   @1
                 GetSysDate   @2
                 GetSysInfo   @3
                 WEP          @4   RESIDENTNAME

   After making the changes, rebuild SYSINFO.DLL using SYSINFO.MAK. When you then
   run SYSDATA.EXE, it will correctly reference the functions within the rebuilt
   SYSINFO.DLL and display the correct data.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 6.1, and 6.1a. This
problem was corrected in MASM version 6.11.
