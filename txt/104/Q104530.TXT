The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up and MS-DOS Uninstall may exit with the following error
message:

   Error reading file DOSSETUP.INI

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when MS-DOS Step-Up or Uninstall cannot find DOSSETUP.INI or
UPDATE.INI. This problem can occur if the files are missing, corrupted, or not
located on the same drive as SETUP.EXE (or UNINSTAL.EXE).

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, check the following:

 - Ensure all the MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up files are on the same disk.

 - If you are uninstalling MS-DOS, ensure the Uninstall disk is in drive A.

 - Ensure MS-DOS can read the disk. For example, type "copy /b a:*.* nul"
   (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press
   ENTER.

 - If you downloaded MS-DOS Step-Up from one of the electronic services, try
   downloading it again.
