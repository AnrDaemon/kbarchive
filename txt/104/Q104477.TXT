TITLE   :FIX: FoxPro Calculator Returning Incorrect Percentages
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:2.0,2.5x,2.6,2.6a; WINDOWS:2.5x,2.6,2.6a,3.0

KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6, 2.6a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5x, 2.6, 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The FoxPro calculator returns the wrong values when the percent (%) sign is
used. Incorrect values are consistently returned regardless of the numbers used
in the calculation. For the numbers 2 and 3 divided by any number, the
percentage returned appears to be half of what it should be. For higher numbers,
it appears as if the calculator is actually inserting a MOD() function and
returning a percentage of the remainder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, choose the equal sign (=) instead of the percent
sign, and then multiply by 100.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual FoxPro 3.0b
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

NOTE: In Visual FoxPro to run the calculator, type the following in the Command
window:

   " ACTIVATE WINDOW CALCULATOR" (without the quotation marks)

1. In the calculator, enter 1 divided by 2 and then choose the percent sign. The
   correct value returned is 50.

   NOTE: In Visual FoxPro for Windows, .02 is returned.

2. Clear the value, enter 2 divided by 4, and then choose the percent sign. The
   value returned is 25 (it should be 50).

   NOTE: In Visual FoxPro for Windows, .08 is returned.
