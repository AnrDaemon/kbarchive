The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a user tries to access a folder in version 3.0 Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks, MS-DOS workstation, by selecting Options, Folders, Modify (or Delete
or Storage), View, the following error message may be displayed:

   Notice 127 Private folder index missing

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when the FOLDERS\LOC\xxxxxxxx subdirectory of the Mail
database is missing the xxxxxxxx.IDX file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, restore the file from backup. However, if a backup copy
of the .IDX file is not available, you can run the FIXIDX utility to build
xxxxxxxx.IDX file from the folder files.

NOTE: Using the FIXIDX utility will result in loss of folder names. However, if
the .FLD files are also unavailable, the administrator must reset Folder
privileges for the user.

To reset Folder privileges, start the Administrator program. Select Local-Admin,
Folders, Reset, and select the user from the list. This will delete all
references to the user's old folders. The user can now rebuild the folders from
scratch.

The FIXIDX.EXE utility is available as part of the Database Maintenance Utilities
document. To obtain the document containing the Database Maintenance Utilities,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
