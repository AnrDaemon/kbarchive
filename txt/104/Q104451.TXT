======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
 - Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you paste link a picture of an Excel chart to a PowerPoint slide, it is
linked to the original worksheet by default, rather than linking the picture to
the chart. This behavior occurs if you place the chart in its own chart window
before selecting Edit Copy Picture.

You can see that the picture has been linked rather than embedded by going to the
PowerPoint Edit menu and selecting Links, which is available only if the slide
contains linked object(s).

RESOLUTION
==========

Follow these steps to paste the picture as an embedded object:

1. In Excel, select the chart on the worksheet.

2. Holding down the SHIFT key, on the Edit menu click Copy Picture.

3. Switch to PowerPoint, and on the Edit menu click Paste.

After following these steps, you should have an embedded picture of the Excel
chart on your PowerPoint slide.
