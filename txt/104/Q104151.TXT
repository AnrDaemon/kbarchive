TITLE   :Setup Doesn't Install Audio Drivers in NT

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Multimedia Mozart for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
 - Microsoft Multimedia Schubert for Windows, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Multimedia Stravinsky for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Schubert, Stravinsky or Mozart under Microsoft Windows NT,
neither the CD Audio driver nor the Microsoft Audio Compression Manager driver
are installed. If you then try to run Schubert, Stravinsky or Mozart, the
following error message appears (assuming the CD-ROM is drive D:):

   The correct CD must be in drive D: to continue.

You may also receive the following error message:

   Unable to play sound file.

The Setup program purposely omits installing these drivers because including them
in the installation procedure causes problems under Windows NT.

RESOLUTION
==========

After installing Schubert, Stravinsky or Mozart, you can install the two missing
audio drivers as follows:

1. In the Windows NT Control Panel, choose Drivers.

2. From the list in the Drivers dialog box, select the following two drivers:

   Microsoft Audio Compression Manager
   [MCI] CD Audio

3. Choose Add.

4. Close the Drivers dialog box, the Control Panel, and Windows NT.

5. Restart Windows NT.

Schubert, Stravinsky and Mozart should now run correctly.
