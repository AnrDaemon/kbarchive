TITLE   :MIRROR Err Msg on DBLSPACE Drive: The Boot Sector for this...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2,6.22

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

MIRROR may return the following error message when you try to use it on a small
DoubleSpace-compressed drive:

   Drive D: error.
   The boot sector for this drive is incompatible with the MIRROR command. The
   mirror process was unsuccessful.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs only if you try to use MIRROR on a very small (approximately
1-megabyte) DoubleSpace-compressed drive that you created by running DBLSPACE
/CREATE (or by choosing Create New Drive from the Compress menu in the
DoubleSpace maintenance program).

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, run Mirror on the host for the compressed drive. To
determine which drive is your host drive, type "dblspace /list" (without the
quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

Additional query words: 6.00 6.20
