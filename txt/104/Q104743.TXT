OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

There is no facility in the Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) included with
versions 3.0, 3.2 and 3.5 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks to remove or
deactivate a Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync) requestor, or to reset a
requestor to its installed state. ADMIN.EXE continues to ask if a user who was
created or modified on the requestor is to be included in Dir-Sync, regardless
of whether Dir-Sync is actually enabled on that postoffice.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.2 and 3.5 of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. We are researching this problem and will post
new information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

ADMIN.EXE can remove the files that make a postoffice the Dir-Sync server
(through the Config, Dir-Sync, Options command), but there is no method to reset
the requestor record in the REQCONF.GLB file. Users continue to be added to the
REQTRANS.GLB file if the administrator responds "Yes" to the question of whether
to include this user in Dir-Sync.
