TITLE   :ScanDisk /CHECKONLY Mode on Third-Party Compressed Disks
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

If ScanDisk detects Stacker, XtraDrive, SuperStor, or DoubleDisk drivers in
memory, it runs in CHECKONLY mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you run ScanDisk on a system using third-party disk-compression software
without specifying any command-line parameters (or with command-line parameters
that are incompatible with /CHECKONLY), ScanDisk displays the following message

   You cannot use the /<SWITCH_NAME> while <COMPR_SW_NAME> is
   running.
   To check for disk problems without fixing them, type SCANDISK /CHECKONLY at
   the command prompt.

where <SWITCH_NAME> is AUTOFIX or CUSTOM and <COMPR_SW_NAME> is
Stacker, SuperStor, DoubleDisk, or XtraDrive.

Erroneous Error Message with Third-Party Device Drivers
-------------------------------------------------------

The following third-party device drivers cause ScanDisk to erroneously report
that third-party disk-compression software is running:

   Device Driver      Third-Party Product
   -------------      -------------------
   BRIDGE.DRV         SYSGEN external floppy drive
   DISCTEC.SYS        DISCTEC removable hard drive


If you run ScanDisk on a system using third-party disk-compression software and
use command-line parameters that are compatible with /CHECKONLY, no message is
displayed.

To repair problems with your third-party disk-compression software, use the disk
repair utility provided with the product.

ScanDisk also refuses to scan uncompressed disks on systems using third- party
disk-compression software because it detects the disk-compression software by
scanning memory, rather than attempting to detect which drive is compressed.
