======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.2, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: MS-DOS 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While composing a message in version 3.0, 3.0a, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks, MS-DOS workstation, you may receive the following message:

   Notice 98 No log folder has been defined

CAUSE
=====

When you create a folder and set Autologging to Yes by selecting Options,
Configure, Log, Folder, Compose-Messages, the ACCESS3.GLB is updated with this
information.

If you delete this folder with Autologging still set to Yes, then Options,
Configure, Log, Folder, and Compose-Messages are blank and Autologging appears
to be set to No. However, the information is not actually reset; the program
still looks for a log folder and ACCESS3.GLB is not updated when you delete a
folder.

This error occurs with Compose_Messages and Read_Messages log folders, regardless
of whether the folder is private or shared.

RESOLUTION
==========

Create a new folder by selecting Options, Configure, Log, Folder,
Compose-Messages. Choose the folder and set Autologging to No. Then delete the
folder.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
