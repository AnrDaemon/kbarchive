PROD/VER:3.1

KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

Under Windows NT, Peachtree Accounting for Windows version 2.0 (Batch 02) may
not be able to use some of the company functions.


Peachtree will run through the correct steps in setting up companies, but if you
choose Open Company from the File menu, no dialog box appears so that you can
select the company of choice to open. The same thing may happen if you choose
Delete Company from the File menu; you may not be given a list of companies to
delete.

RESOLUTION
==========

According to Peachtree for Windows Technical Support, upgrading to Batch 05
should correct this problem.

For additional information, contact Peachtree Technical Support at (404)
