TITLE   :Norton Speed Disk May Not Recognize DoubleSpace Floppy Disk
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

When you run Symantec Norton Utilities Speed Disk (SPEEDISK.EXE) and choose to
optimize a previously unmounted DoubleSpace-compressed floppy disk, Speed Disk
does not display the floppy disk as a DoubleSpace-compressed disk.

The DoubleSpace-compressed floppy disk is automatically mounted, but Speed Disk
does not update its display correctly. Also, the DoubleSpace-compressed floppy
disk's host drive is not displayed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To make Speed Disk correctly display the DoubleSpace-compressed floppy disk and
its host drive:

 - Access the floppy disk before you run Speed Disk. For example, type "dir a:"
   (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press
   ENTER before you run Speed Disk.

-or-

 - Exit Speed Disk and then restart it.

Additional query words: 6.20 speedisk speeddisk sd.exe
