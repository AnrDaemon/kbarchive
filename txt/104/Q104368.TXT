TITLE   :PC Win: Lotus 1-2-3 Does Not Launch Mail Attachment
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, you cannot launch Lotus
1-2-3 version 3.0 or 3.1 mail attachments by double-clicking the attached icon.

CAUSE
=====

Lotus 1-2-3 does not allow you to load files directly by using a filename as a
command-line parameter.

RESOLUTION
==========

This is a limitation of Lotus 1-2-3 versions 3.0 and 3.1 and is not a Microsoft
Windows or Mail problem.

Lotus works around this problem by using a 123.BAT batch file and an AUTO123.WK3
autoexecute macro. The 123.BAT file creates a text file with the name and path
of the file to be loaded and then loads 123.EXE. The AUTO123.WK3 file reads the
filename and path information from the text file and loads the desired file.

In Windows File Manager, the File Associate command associates .WK3 files with
123.BAT instead of 123.EXE.

Specific information on the creation of the 123.BAT and AUTO123.WK3 files is
available from Lotus in a technical note titled, "Loading a 123 3.0 File from
the Command Line."
