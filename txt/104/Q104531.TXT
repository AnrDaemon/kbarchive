TITLE   :DoubleSpace Fails to Mount Compressed Disk in BackPack Drive
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

DoubleSpace may fail to automatically mount compressed floppy disks in BackPack
drives.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the BACKPACK.SYS device driver is loaded after the
DBLSPACE.SYS driver in the CONFIG.SYS file.

The DoubleSpace Automount code works on block device drivers only when they are
loaded before DBLSPACE.SYS.

RESOLUTION
==========

Load BACKPACK.SYS before DBLSPACE.SYS in the CONFIG.SYS file.

Additional query words: 6.20 automount
