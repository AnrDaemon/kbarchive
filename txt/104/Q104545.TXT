TITLE   :MemMaker Does Not Recognize All Netroom Drivers

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft MS-DOS MemMaker does not correctly remove all Netroom drivers when it
optimizes your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. As a result, your system may
not function correctly.

CAUSE
=====

At this time, MemMaker doesn't recognize all the Netroom drivers. It does
recognize (and remove) RM386, DOSUMB, and devices loaded with XLOAD. However, it
doesn't recognize the cloaking drivers and the stacks program (SYSCLOAK.EXE,
VIDCLOAK.EXE, DOBIOS.COM, and DOSUMB.COM).

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, remove the Netroom drivers from your CONFIG.SYS and
AUTOEXEC.BAT files before you run MemMaker.
