======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

MS-DOS 6.2 DoubleSpace leaves the following files on the uncompressed host
drive:

   ASPI4DOS.SYS
   USPI14.SYS

MORE INFORMATION
================

DoubleSpace supports restartability during the compress and uncompress
processes. If you are compressing or uncompressing a DoubleSpace- compressed
drive and the process is interrupted (for example, there is a loss of power),
MS-DOS restarts the DoubleSpace compress or uncompress process when the machine
restarts.

Machines that use ASPI4DOS.SYS or USPI14.SYS need to have these files available
when the system restarts. To support these machines, DoubleSpace leaves the
files on the uncompressed host drive.

DoubleSpace knows to leave these files on the uncompressed host drive by reading
the COPY= settings in the DBLSPACE.INF file. The COPY=[filename] entry specifies
that the file should be copied to the compressed drive as well as left on the
uncompressed drive.

Additional query words: 6.20 UPSI14.SYS
