The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Cinemania, versions 1992 editions, 1994 editions 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you search for a word in the Find Word dialog box with the Option for Topic
Titles Only selected, Cinemania does not find movie titles that contain the
word.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Movie titles are not Topic Titles, and thus Find differentiates between the two.
This is a part of the product design. If you would like to search for words in
movie titles, do not use the Option to find words in Topic Titles Only.

The best way to find a movie title is in the Contents dialog box. You can specify
many different parameters to narrow your search. For example, you can specify
the director, actors, genre, and star ratings. To use the Contents dialog box,
choose the Contents button at the bottom of the remote control.

Using Find
----------

If you want to use the Find Word dialog box to find any entry (including a movie
title) that contains a particular word, do the following:

1. Click the Find Word menu.

2. Type your search word in the Search By Word area.

3. Click Options, and make sure that Topic Titles Only is NOT checked.

4. Click OK to close the Options dialog box, and click OK again to start the
   search.
