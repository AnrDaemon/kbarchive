SUMMARY
=======

This article shows by example how to get the IPROP_STD_LEFT, IPROP_STD_TOP,
IPROP_STD_WIDTH, and IPROP_STD_HEIGHT values using the VBGetControlProperty
function.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The IPROP_STD_LEFT, IPROP_STD_TOP, IPROP_STD_WIDTH, and IPROP_STD_HEIGHT
properties are stored as floats. The following code shows how to call
VBGetControlProperty to get these properties from a VBX and DLL. It is assumed
that the standard property indexes found in VBAPI.H were used to build the
control.

   /* VBGetControlProperty is prototyped in vbapi.h */ 
   #include <vbapi.h>

   *** You also need to add "vbapi.lib" to the libraries in the makefile. ***

    float fValue ;
    int nRet ;

     /* hctl would normally be passed in as a HCTL to the function using
        VBGetControlProperty */ 
     /* The third parameter must be the address of a float */ 
    nRet = VBGetControlProperty(hctl, IPROP_STD_TOP, &fValue) ;

Now fValue has the value of Top property for the hctl control.
