This occurs if you are using an Orchid Fahrenheit 1280 S3 card with an Orchid

the protected-mode drivers supplied with Windows 95. The driver in Windows 95 is
the Orchid Fahrenheit 1280 Plus (S3) version 4.0.

To avoid this problem, use one of the video drivers listed below:

 - The newest compatible Orchid drivers (dated 6/15/93 or later).
