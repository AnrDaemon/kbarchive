SYMPTOMS
========

If the Flight Control Realism setting is set higher than 5, the Cessna and the
Sopwith Camel may pull uncontrollably to the left.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Flight Simulator 5.0 has added Propeller Torque as one of the conditions that it
simulates. In a real propeller aircraft, a certain amount of torque is generated
by the engine/propeller, which causes the aircraft to pull to the left during
high-thrust situations. This condition is especially noticeable on the ground
during takeoff. Flight Simulator 5.0 attempts to model engine torque. However,
if the Flight Control Realism is set higher than 5, the propeller torque becomes
somewhat excessive and the aircraft pulls to the left.

Control can be maintained by turning off Auto Coordination in the Sim menu and
using the rudders to control the torque during takeoff roll where the torque is
most noticeable. Additionally, moving the throttle somewhat slowly when
advancing to full power will allow time to react to the torque.

This condition does not occur with the Learjet 35A because it has jet turbine
engines, nor the Scweizer 2-32 Sailplane because it has no engines.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Flight Simulator for MS-DOS,
version 5.0.
