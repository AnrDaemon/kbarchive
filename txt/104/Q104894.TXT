TITLE   :FIX: VERIFY Doesn't Check Last Character in String
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The intrinsic function VERIFY doesn't compare the last character of the
character string with the character set.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS,
version 1.0. This problem has been resolved with FORTRAN PowerStation
maintenance release version 1.0a for MS-DOS.

FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0 can be differentiated from the maintenance
release version 1.0a by invoking the linker. Typing "link32 | more" from
\F32\BIN directory will show version 2.8 for FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0,
and it will show version 1.0f for the maintenance release version 1.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The intrinsic function VERIFY compares the characters of one string with another
string.

      VERIFY (charstr, charset [,log])

Each character of charstr is compared with the charset. VERIFY returns the
position of the first character in charstr that it could not find in charset. If
log is true, characters are taken from charstr in reverse.

The sample code fails if compiled with FORTRAN PowerStation, but will pass with
FORTRAN 5.1 and 5.0. Versions of FORTRAN before 5.0 do not have the VERIFY
function.

Sample Code
-----------

   C No compiler options required
         i = verify('ba','b')
         if (i.eq.2) then
           print*, 'verify correct:   ',i
         else
           print*, 'verify incorrect: ',i
         end if
         end
