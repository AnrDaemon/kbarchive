The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Multimedia Stravinsky for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to run Stravinsky from the second chained CD-ROM (CD) drive, the
following error message will appear

   Please insert the correct CD into drive <drive>:

where <drive> is the drive letter of the first CD-ROM drive.

By default, Stravinsky expects the CD to be in the first CD-ROM drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can force Stravinsky to read the CD from the second chained CD-ROM drive as
follows:

1. In Notepad or another text editor, open the file STRAV.INI.

2. Add the following line

   "CDDrive=<drive>:" (without the quotation marks)

   where <drive> is the drive letter of the drive you want to use.

3. Save and close the STRAV.INI file.

When you restart Stravinsky, it should be able to read the CD in the second
CD-ROM drive.
