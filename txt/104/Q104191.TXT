SUMMARY
=======

NCR Wavelan wireless network cards must have the same network identification
(ID) number to communicate with each other on the network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you initially run the Wavelan setup software, it prompts you for a network
ID number. If you do not supply a number, the software generates a random
4-digit number and assigns it as the network ID. Two Wavelan cards with
different ID numbers cannot see one another on the network.

To check the current ID number under Windows for Workgroups version 3.1, press
PAUSE when the driver is loaded from the CONFIG.SYS file. Included in the two
lines of text displayed is NWID=<xxxx> (where <xxxx> is the network
ID number).

To check the current ID number under Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 run the
diagnostic program that provided with these cards.

If you need to change the ID number, rerun the network card setup software.

NOTE: The diagnostic program that ships with these cards tests communication
between two cards independent of their network ID numbers. Efficient
communication during this test does not guarantee that they can communicate over
the network.

The NCR products included here are manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
