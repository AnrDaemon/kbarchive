TITLE   :SET Command May Truncate the List of Environment Variables
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Windows NT SET command in Command Prompt, the list of
environment variables may be truncated if the size of the list of environment
variables you have exceeds 3.5 KB.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start Command Prompt from the Main group in Program Manager.

2. Run approximately 50 SET commands, assigning each variable at least 100
   characters. For example:

   SET TEST1 = ABCDEFGHIJABCDEFGHIJABCDEFGHIJABCDEFGHIJ
   ABCDEFGHIJABCDEFGHIJABCDEFGHIJABCDEFGHIJABCDEFGHIJABCDEFGHIJ

   SET TEST2 = ABCDEFGHIJABCDEFGHIJABCDEFGHIJABCDEFGHIJ
   ABCDEFGHIJABCDEFGHIJABCDEFGHIJABCDEFGHIJABCDEFGHIJABCDEFGHIJ
   ...

3. Type SET and press ENTER.

You will only see 30 to 35 of the self-defined variables.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.1 and
Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
