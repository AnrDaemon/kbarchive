The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

MS-DOS Setup may create a second Microsoft Tools groups in Microsoft Windows.

CAUSE
=====

This situation occurs when the Microsoft Tools group location or filename
changes. For example, the default name and typical MS-DOS directory lead to the
following filename and path:

   C:\DOS\WNTOOLS.GRP

If you change the filename or directory location after you install MS-DOS 6.0,
two Microsoft Tools groups exist after you install a later version of MS-DOS.

To prevent Setup from destroying your customized group entries, the setup logic
is cautious when replacing groups. If your WNTOOLS.GRP file is still in the DOS
directory, MS-DOS 6.2 replaces the old WNTOOLS.GRP file with a new one.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this situation, delete one of the groups.
