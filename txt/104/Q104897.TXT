TITLE   :BUG: Syntax Error in Makefile with Projects > 511 Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Visual Workbench cannot recognize a project makefile that contains more than
511 files. A syntax error is reported for the internal makefile.

CAUSE
=====

An internal makefile can contain no more than 511 continuation lines, and there
is a continuation line for every file in the SBR section.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two solutions to the project makefile problem that contains more than
511 files:

 - Load the makefile as an external makefile.

-or-

 - Edit the SBR section so that it has less than 512 continuation lines. More
   than one file can be on each line. For example, change

   A511.SBR \
   A512.SBR

   to the following:

   A511.SBR A512.SBR

The disadvantage to the first solution is that the project cannot be edited. The
disadvantage to the second solution is that it has to be redone each time the
project is edited.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS,
version 1.0 and version 1.0a.

This is not a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation 32.
