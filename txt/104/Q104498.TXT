SUMMARY
=======

The following modes used when opening a file with OpenFile() have an effect only
if SHARE is loaded:

OF_SHARE_COMPAT (same as specifying no sharing flags, thus its name): If the file
has not been opened in any other sharing mode, the current task may open the
same file in OF_SHARE_COMPAT mode any number of times. If the current task
attempts to open the file in any other sharing mode, the open will fail. If
other tasks attempt to open the file with any sharing mode, the open will fail.
If the file has the read-only file attribute, other tasks may open the file in
OF_SHARE_COMPAT mode any number of times.

OF_SHARE_DENY_WRITE: If the file has not been opened in any other sharing mode,
any task may open the file any number of times in OF_SHARE_DENY WRITE.
Attempting to open the file in any other sharing modes will fail.

OF_SHARE_DENY_READ: If the file has not been opened in any other sharing mode,
any task may open the file any number of times in OF_SHARE_DENY_READ. Attempting
to open the file in any other sharing modes will fail.

OF_SHARE_EXCLUSIVE: If the file has not been opened in any other sharing mode,
the file will be opened. Any additional attempts to open the file in any sharing
modes by any task will fail.

OF_SHARE_DENY_NONE: If the file has not been opened in any other sharing mode,
any task may open the file any number of times in OF_SHARE_DENY_NONE. Attempting
to open the file in any other sharing modes will fail.
