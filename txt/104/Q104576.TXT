TITLE   :Embedding Non-printable Characters in LMHOSTS Computer Names

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under Windows NT, the LMHOSTS file enables you to specify names
containing non-printable or extended characters. Custom applications
that make use of special names to function properly in routed
topologies may benefit from this feature.

To use this feature, you can specify non-printable characters by using
their hexidecimal notations and surrounding the entire name in quotes, \nn
or \0xnn, where "nn" is the two-digit hexidecimal number. For example:

   102.54.94.97   rhinodc     #DOM:rhino   #the rhino domain DC
   11.14.21.96    "appl\0x1f"              #internal db application
                                            gateway

NOTE: By using the special naming extension of the Windows NT LMHOSTS
files, you surrender backward compatibility with Microsoft LAN
Manager. (The LAN Manager TCP/IP implementation does not recognize the
hexidecimal format.)
