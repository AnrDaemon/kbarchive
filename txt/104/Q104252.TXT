TITLE   :Running MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up over an OEM Version of MS-DOS 6.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======


This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up over an original equipment
manufacturer (OEM) version of MS-DOS 6.0, you may receive one of the following
error messages:

   In order to run the MS-DOS 6.2 single-disk upgrade, you must already have
   MS-DOS 6.0 installed on your system.

   -or-

   Cannot Update File. Setup could not update the following file to MS-DOS 6.2:

   <filename>

   Although Setup can continue without updating this file, your MS-DOS 6.2
   installation will be incomplete.

CAUSE
=====

If you receive the first error message noted above, you either have the OEM
"base version" of MS-DOS 6.0, or your OEM has modified the core MS-DOS 6.2
system files (IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS, and COMMAND.COM). If your OEM version of MS-DOS
6.2 falls into either of these categories, you must either obtain your OEM's
version of MS-DOS 6.2 or obtain the MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade. If you choose to obtain
the MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade, you may lose some MS-DOS functionality or features added
to MS-DOS 6.0 by your OEM.

NOTE: Step-Up cannot upgrade the OEM base version of MS-DOS 6.0 because the OEM
base version does not include DoubleSpace, Microsoft Backup, Microsoft
Anti-Virus, and Microsoft Undelete.

If you receive the second error message noted above, your OEM has modified one or
more of the MS-DOS 6.2 files but has not modified the core system files. In this
case, you can successfully install MS-DOS 6.2, but some files will not be
updated. You may be able to work around this situation by copying the MS-DOS 6.0
OEM version of the files that were not updated from the C:\OLD_DOS.1 directory
to the C:\DOS directory and then using SETVER.EXE to report MS-DOS as version
6.0 to the program files that were not updated. Before doing so, contact your
OEM to determine if this would be a safe and practical workaround.

The following OEMs have modified MS-DOS 6.0 in some manner:


 - Compaq

 - Dell

 - Texas Instruments

 - Toshiba

MORE INFORMATION
================


Dell
----

MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up installs successfully, but you lose OEM-added functionality
with the following programs:

   KEYB.COM
   POWER.EXE

Texas Instruments (TI)
----------------------

TI modified core MS-DOS system files. You must either obtain the OEM version of
MS-DOS 6.2 or the MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade. With the MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade, you may lose
functionality added by TI. Texas Instruments modified the following MS-DOS 6.0
files:

   COMMAND.COM
   DOSSETUP.INI
   FORMAT.COM
   IO.SYS
   PRINT.EXE
   SETUP.OEM
   SYS.COM


Toshiba
-------

Toshiba has released the Toshiba Special Enhancements Package (TSEP)for MS-DOS
6.2. This release updates an installation of MS-DOS 6.2, adding Toshiba's
special enhancements for complete compatibility with Toshiba's proprietary
features. To use TSEP, your specific Toshiba model must be compatible with this
release of TSEP and must already have MS-DOS 6.2 or the MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up
package installed on it.

To obtain TSEP, download TSEP62.EXE from the Toshiba bulletin board at (714)
837-4408. For more information, contact Toshiba Technical Support.

Toshiba replaces the following MS-DOS 6.2 files:

   IO.SYS
   ANSI.SYS

   EGA.SYS
   GRAPHICS.COM
   GRAPHICS.PRO
   KEYB.COM
