SUMMARY
=======

Chapter 4 of the "Technical Reference" for versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft
Mail for PC Networks does not include the FLAGS parameter for the Microsoft
Visual Basic MAPISaveMail function call.

The function declaration in GLOBAL.BAS included on the Technical Reference disk
does include the parameter.

Valid FLAG parameters can be found in the MAPI C functions descriptions in
Chapter 3 of the "Technical Reference." The correct function call is:

      MAPISaveMail(
         ByVal Session&,
         ByVal UIParam&,
         Message As MAPIMessage,
         Recipient As MapiRecip,
         File As MapiFile,
         ByVal Flags&,
         ByVal Reserved&,
         MsgId$) As Long
