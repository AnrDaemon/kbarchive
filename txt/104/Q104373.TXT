TITLE   :3COM: Installation Stops If There Is a Space in Server Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::1.0

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Version 1.0 of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to 3Com installation process prompts
you for the three-part 3Com XNS name for the mail server used on your network.
If you have added a legal space in the name portion of the three-part name, the
installation process stops.

NOTE: The installation may not provide an error message; it may simply stop
installing the gateway.

CAUSE
=====

A space is a legal character in a 3Com XNS name, but the installation program
does not handle the space correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add an alias to the three-part 3Com XNS name for a server that does NOT contain
a space in its name, then reinstall the gateway.

After installing the gateway, you can remove the 3Com alias and edit the
GATEWAY.INI file with the correct name.

NOTE: To add an alias, use the 3Com 3N.EXE utility and use the ADD ALIAS option.
Make sure the alias you add does NOT contain any spaces in its name.
