SYMPTOMS
========

When you start one the programs listed at the top of this article, you may
receive the following error message:

   The file C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\PICCLIP.VBX is out of date.
   This program requires a newer version.

When you choose OK, the following error message appears:

   Unexpected error: quitting.

The program then closes.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if any of the three following conditions exist:

 - Another Visual Basic application is already running, and is using an
   out-of-date version of the PICCLIP.VBX file.
 - An out-of-date version of the PICCLIP.VBX file is higher on the search list
   than the current version installed with the applications listed at the top of
   this article. The applications are finding the out-of-date version before
   they get to the current version.
 - An out-of-date version of PICCLIP.VBX has copied over the version installed
   by the Setup program for the applications listed at the top of this article.

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: For more information about how to perform the steps listed below in
Windows, see your Windows printed documentation or online Help.

To correct the problem, copy the PICCLIP.VBX file again from your application
CD-ROM to your Windows SYSTEM subdirectory, and remove all previous or duplicate
versions of PICCLIP.VBX from your hard drive. The PICCLIP.VBX file is in the
following locations:

   SCHUBERT\MSSTP\SHARED (Schubert)
   STRAUSS\MSSTP\SHARED (Strauss)
   STRAV\MSSTP\SHARED (Stravinsky)
   MOZART\MSSTP\SHARED (Mozart)
   KIDSCAT (Magic School Bus)
   ZZMMCAT (Baseball, Basketball)
   SAMPLER (Sampler 4.0)
   MMCAT (All Others)

MORE INFORMATION
================

The programs listed at the top of this article search for the PICCLIP.VBX file
in the following order (note that this follows standard Windows file search
ordering):

1. Current directory

2. Windows directory

3. Windows SYSTEM subdirectory

4. All the directories on the path, in order

The Setup program installs PICCLIP.VBX to the Windows SYSTEM directory. If the
applications listed at the top of this article encounter an invalid version of
PICCLIP.VBX before they find the up-to-date version, the error occurs. Problems
may also occur if more than one copy of the PICCLIP.VBX file is found.
