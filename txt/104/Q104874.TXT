SYMPTOMS
========

When you play an AVI video or animation using the 24x Diamond Speedster 32,000-
or 64,000-color video drivers, you may receive the following errors:

   MMTASK caused a Stack Fault in module P32K480.DRV at 0008:153E

-or-

   MMTASK caused a Stack Fault in module P64K480.DRV at 0008:151C

You must restart your system after this error occurs. If you then try to play the
same video or animation clip again it will work; however, the picture may appear
to be smeared.

performance or reliability.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, you need to get updated copies of P32K480.DRV (the
32,000-color video driver) and/or P64K480.DRV (the 64,000-color video driver).
