SUMMARY
=======

ScanDisk has the capability to monitor the average read, write, and seek times
during surface analysis. If ScanDisk determines a test of a particular area is
taking too long, ScanDisk warns you that the area is nearing failure and offers
to correct the data in the affected clusters.

This functionality is inactive by default but can be enabled by using a command
line switch or by changing a setting in the SCANDISK.INI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To activate this functionality when you run ScanDisk, use the /TIME switch. For
example, type "scandisk c: /time" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS
command prompt and then press ENTER.

To configure ScanDisk to use this functionality every time you run it, use MS-DOS
Editor to edit the Environment section of the SCANDISK.INI file and change
"ScanTimeOut=off" (without the quotation marks) to "ScanTimeOut=on" (without the
quotation marks).

For more information on how ScanDisk fixes bad sectors, query on the following
words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   " how and scandisk and fixes and bad and sectors " (without the quotation
   marks)
