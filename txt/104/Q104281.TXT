-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks support customized
addressing templates for these gateway types:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision

 - Microsoft Mail Message Service for IBM SNADS

 - Microsoft Mail File Format API for Gateways

Mail administrators use these templates to add information to the address lists
for these external addresses.

NOTE: The PROFS, SNADS, and FFAPI templates are all created with the Import
utility (IMPORT.EXE). All the examples below use PROFS as an example, but you
can substitute FFAPI for PROFS.

Defining a Template
-------------------

The text file that defines the template begins with information such as:

   T PROFS: Gatewayname/Nodeid

   Full Name:~10~25~A~John Doe~
   Location:~10~25~~A~

The first line designates the type of address template you are creating; the "T"
designates the file as a template definition. The second line gives the type of
address information, and the third gives the associated gateway and host IDs.

NOTE: Use Gateway/DGN for SNADS; Network/Postoffice for FFAPI.

Each succeeding line defines a template field. The fields all start in column 2
with the field data starting position, field length, and then a default value
for the field. For more detailed information about these fields, see the
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks "Administrator's Guide."

Use the IMPORT.EXE program to import the template file into the postoffice. For
example

   import admin -ppassword -ftmplt.txt -t

where TMPLT.TXT is the text file containing the template definition and -t
specifies that the import support template information.

Adding Names with Template Information
--------------------------------------

After the template has been created in the postoffice, PROFS addresses can be
imported into the postoffice along with additional information for the template
fields. The import file for the addresses should follow this example:

   A Mike Sterns                     PROFS:PSSGATE/MSVM6/MSTERNS
   - Full Name:/Mike A. Sterns
   - Location:/New York, NY
   A John Foe                        PROFS:PSSGATE/MSVM6/JFOE
   - Full Name:/John G. Foe
   - Location:/LOS Angeles, CA

The "A" designates that this address is to be added to the postoffice, along with
the template information. Each following line of template information must start
with a dash (-) followed by a space. The order of the prompts in the information
should match the order of the prompts in the template definition.

Use the IMPORT.EXE utility to import these addresses into the post office. For
example

   import admin -ppassword -fnames.txt -t

where NAMES.TXT is the text file containing the gateway names with template
information and -t specifies that the import should support template
information.

NOTE: You can combine a template's definition and address into one file and
import it into the mail database in one step.
