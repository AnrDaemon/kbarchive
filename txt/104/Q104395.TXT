-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

StretchDIBits faults inside GDI when passed a 24-bpp Presentation Manager (PM)
style device-independent bitmap (DIB) on a device that supports RC_STRETCHDIB.

CAUSE
=====

GDI must convert the old style BITMAPCOREINFO structure into a new BITMAPINFO
structure before passing it to a driver's RC_STRETCHDIB function. If the old
style DIB has no color table, GDI will fault as it attempts to append a
zero-length color table to the end of its temporary BITMAPINFOHEADER.

RESOLUTION
==========

On devices that support RC_STRETCHDIB, do the conversion into the new style DIB
format for GDI before calling into it when using 24-bpp PM-sytle DIBs.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
