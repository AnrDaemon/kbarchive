KEYWORDS:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a, included with:
    - Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows needs to notify you of an event, it
displays a Reminder pop-up dialog box. This dialog box asks whether you want to
be reminded again. A field is available for entering a new reminder frequency.
This field is not pen-aware (that is, it does not accept handwritten numeric
inputs). Instead, the cursor remains an I-beam and pen input is disabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the Control Panel Pen application for Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing,
turn on the Enable Writing In All Applications option.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 1.0 and 1.0a of
Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: schedule plus 1.00 1.00a
