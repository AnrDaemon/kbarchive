-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You cannot use ScanDisk on a LANtastic server because all local drives are seen
as network drives. To use ScanDisk, disable the LANtastic server service by
using the REM command to remark out the server command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file, then restart the computer. After you run ScanDisk, remove the REM command
from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and restart your computer again.

This situation occurs only when the machine is running the LANtastic server
software.


Additional query words: 6.20 scan disk
