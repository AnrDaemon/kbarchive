The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups SDK, version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The NCBS and SESSIONS settings found in the [MS$NETBEUI] section of the
PROTOCOL.INI file, affect only the real mode NetBEUI; the protected mode NetBEUI
(VNB.386) ignores these settings and allocates resources dynamically from the
Virtual Memory Manager's heap.

The real mode NetBEUI is used only if the commands NET START NETBEUI or NET START
FULL are issued before Windows for Workgroups is started. Otherwise, the
protected mode NetBEUI and redirector are used, freeing up more conventional
memory.


Additional query words: wfw wfwg settings parameters
