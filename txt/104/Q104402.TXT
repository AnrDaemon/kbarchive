TITLE   :PC WSPlus: Err Msg: Not Enough Disk Space Available...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,1.0a,3.0,3.0b,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Setup program (SETUP.EXE) to install version 1.0 or 1.0a of
Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, the following error message may appear:

   There is not enough disk space available to install Schedule+

The error message indicates that there is not enough disk space on the drive
where Schedule+ is being installed. However, this message will also appear when
there is not enough disk space available on the disk drive or partition where
Microsoft Windows is installed.

NOTE: This error message may also appear when you try to load versions 3.0, 3.0b,
and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.

CAUSE
=====

When the Setup program determines available disk space, it looks at the target
drive for information. When the Setup program attempts to write to the Windows
directory (on a different drive), there may not be enough disk space to write
the SCHDPLUS.INI into the Windows directory and the necessary .DLL files into
the WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Move or delete files to free up the drive and ensure there is enough disk space
available on the drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================
