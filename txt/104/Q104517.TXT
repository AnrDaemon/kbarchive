 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) from
versions 3.0 and 3.0b of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks to run the MAPIAddress()
function, you may receive the following error message:

   Out of Memory

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs if a second MAPI session is started and closed, and the
MAPIAddress() function is then executed in the first session. The window class
of the first session is destroyed because its window class is duplicated by the
second session.

RESOLUTION
==========

Upgrade to version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows to obtain the new
FRAMEWRK.DLL file.

FRAMEWRK.DLL is also available with version 1.0 of Microsoft Electronic Forms
Designer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the FRAMEWRK.DLL file included
with versions 3.0 and 3.0b of Microsoft Mail for Windows. This problem was
corrected in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows.
