The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to AT T, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Version 1.0 of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to AT&T is based on the Microsoft
Mail File Format Application Program Interface (FFAPI). FFAPI is used to place
mail messages into and extract messages from the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
postoffice. The gateway uses the FFAPI executables common to the SMTP gateway
because they both require the same SMTP addressing components and mail queues.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SMTPGET.EXE and SMTPPUT.EXE executable files are spawned by the AT&T
gateway executable using the following command lines:

   smtpput -f1 -h -l\attgate\log.txt mmff.put

   smtpget -f1 -h -j -l\attgate\l\log.txt mmff.get

Both the MMFF.PUT and MMFF.GET files are placed in the ATTGATE\MMFF subdirectory
on the Microsoft Mail postoffice. They are in an ASCII text file that contains
the complete mail message in FFAPI format.

NOTE: This is a good test to use when trying to determine if a problem with the
gateway is caused by FFAPI executables or the gateway executables themselves. It
is a good starting place for mail and database issues.
