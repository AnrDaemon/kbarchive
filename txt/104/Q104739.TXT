TITLE   :Apps and Copying Files to Floppy Seem Slow with Automount
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

Under MS-DOS 6.2, copying files to (or from) removable media disks seems slower
when the Automount switch for DoubleSpace-compressed floppy disks is enabled.
Applications that are disk intensive (such as Microsoft Defragmenter [Defrag])
may also seem slower under MS-DOS 6.2 when accessing removable media disks.

CAUSE
=====

The additional Automount functionality comes with some performance tradeoffs.
Those who want maximum floppy performance or who don't plan to use compressed
floppies may choose to disable automatic mounting.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, disable Automount. To do this, type the following
at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER:

   " dblspace /automount=0" (without the quotation marks)

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information on DoubleSpace and Automount, type "help automount"
(without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

Additional query words: 6.20 floppy disk diskette performance slow auto mount slowly
