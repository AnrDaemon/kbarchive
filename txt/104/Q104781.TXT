TITLE   :Cannot Delete SUBST Drives If You Are Using DoubleSpace
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

SUBST does not correctly delete substituted drives when you are using
DoubleSpace.

For example, if you use SUBST as follows to create an E drive, you cannot
correctly remove it:

   SUBST E: C:\DOS

When you type "SUBST E /D" (without the quotation marks), the drive is not
deleted correctly.

Some programs (such as Microsoft Diagnostics [MSD]) still report the drive is
valid. If you attempt to access the drive from the MS-DOS command prompt, you
receive the message "Error reading drive E, Abort, Retry, Fail?" instead of the
message "Invalid drive specification."

NOTE: This problem occurs only when you use a drive letter that is reserved for
use by DoubleSpace. To determine which drives are reserved for use by
DoubleSpace, type "dblspace /list" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS
command prompt and then press ENTER.

CAUSE
=====


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this situation, restart your computer.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS versions 6.0 and 6.2. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
