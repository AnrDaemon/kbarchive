SUMMARY
=======

The Iniheadr.exe sample defines a function called GetPrivateProfileSections(),
which parses a given .INI file and returns a buffer containing the section
headers separated by NULLs and terminated by a double NULL. SECTION.C contains
the function and a necessary helper function. The sample allows the user to
choose an .INI file using the Open common dialog box. The section headings are
then placed in a list box.

The Windows SDK does not define a function to read all of the section headers
from a profile (.INI) file. An application must read the entire .INI file and
parse it to obtain the section headers.

NOTE: Microsoft recommends using Windows's application programming interfaces
(APIs) to read .INI files. The method described below is not guaranteed to work
on future releases, especially for system .INI files such as WINFILE.INI,
WIN.INI, SYSTEM.INI, CONTROL.INI, and so forth.

A profile file (WIN.INI) or a private profile (such as CLOCK.INI) must have the
following form:

   [section heading]
   entry=value

      .
      .
      .

For example, given a profile containing the following section headings

   [windows]
      .
      .
      .

   [Desktop]

      .
      .
      .
   [Extensions]

GetPrivateProfileSections() parses the profile file and places the following in a
buffer:

    windows<NULL>Desktop<NULL>Extensions<NULL><NULL>
