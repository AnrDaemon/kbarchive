TITLE   :FIX: String Comparison Stops at Char(0) (NUL)
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The string comparison operators stop the comparison operation at the occurrence
of the first NUL character. The rest of the string after the first NUL character
is not compared.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the string termination character only at the end of the string.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS,
version 1.0. This problem has been resolved with FORTRAN PowerStation
maintenance release version 1.0a for MS-DOS.

FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0 can be differentiated from the maintenance
release version 1.0a by invoking the linker. Typing "link32 | more" (without the
quotation marks) from \F32\BIN directory will show version 2.8 for FORTRAN
PowerStation version 1.0, and it will show version 1.0f for the maintenance
release version 1.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The string comparison operation works correctly in Microsoft FORTRAN version
5.1. Compiling and executing the following code with PowerStation will
demonstrate the problem.

Sample Code
-----------

   C No compiler options required
          character*10 a,b

          a = "1234567890"
          b = "123456789A"

          a(5:5) = char(0)
          b(5:5) = char(0)

          print *, "Should be: F T T T F F"
          print "(' Result:   ',L2,\)", ( a .eq. b )
          print '(L2,\)', ( a .ne. b )
          print '(L2,\)', ( a .lt. b )
          print '(L2,\)', ( b .gt. a )
          print '(L2,\)', ( b .le. a )
          print '(L2)', ( a .ge. b )

          end
