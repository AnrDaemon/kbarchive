======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

SORT adds an extra character to the end of the file being sorted if an
end-of-file (EOF) or carriage return (<CR>) character is missing from the
end of the file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some text editors don't automatically add a <CR> or EOF character to the
end of the file (unlike MS-DOS Edit).

If you use this type of editor and your file doesn't have a trailing <CR>
or EOF character, your sorted file contains an extra character. For example, if
you sort the following file (which does not have an EOF or <CR> character
at the end of the file)

   AA<CR>
   BB<CR>
   CC<CR>
   AA

with the command SORT < TEXT.TXT > TESTOUT.TXT, your sorted output is

   AA<CR>
   AAx<CR>
   BB<CR>
   CC<CR>

where x is a random character from memory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, edit the file you want to sort and add a <CR>
to the end.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS versions 5.x, 6.0, 6.2,
and 6.21. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
