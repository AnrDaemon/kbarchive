MORE INFORMATION
================

The information displayed by the Dispatch Mail Postoffice Status (F2) and
External Mail Postoffice Status (F3) screens comes directly from the
conventional memory used by the External Mail program.

The routing tables stored in memory are compiled from the MASTER.GLB,
ACCESS2.GLB, GROUP.GLB, NETWORK.GLB, and all the .XTN files stored on the home
postoffice. By default, routing tables are updated every 30 minutes.
