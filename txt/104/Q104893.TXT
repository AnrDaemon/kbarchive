TITLE   :FIX: Using /4Yb and /Ox Together Is Not Recommended
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Running a program compiled with both full optimization (/Ox) and extended error
handling ($DEBUG or /4Yb) may cause several problems including: incorrect
results, incorrect range errors, or hanging.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid these problems, remove either the full optimization compiler switch
(/Ox) or the extended run-time debugging option (/4Yb or $DEBUG).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS,
version 1.0. This problem has been resolved with FORTRAN Powerstation
maintenance release version 1.0a for MS-DOS.

FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0 can be differentiated from the maintenance
release version 1.0a by invoking the linker. Typing "link32 | more" (without the
quotation marks) from \f32\BIN directory will show version 2.8 for FORTRAN
PowerStation version 1.0, and it will show 1.0f for the maintenance release
version 1.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code generates an incorrect range error if compiled with both /Ox
and /4Yb, but runs correctly if either /Ox or /4Yb is not used:

   1
   test.for(6) : run-time error F6096: $DEBUG
   - array subscript expression out of range
   Execution traceback:
   from main program in test.for(6)

This is not a problem in Microsoft FORTRAN 5.1 or earlier.

Sample Code
-----------

   C Compiler options required: /Ox and /4Yb
           INTEGER IA(4)
           data IA / 1, 2, 3, 4 / 
           DO 20 I=1,2
             write(*,*) i
             WRITE(*,*) (IA(J),J=(I-1)*2+1,4)
   20      CONTINUE
           end
