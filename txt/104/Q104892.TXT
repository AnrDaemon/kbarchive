TITLE   :FIX: F2836 on Type Declaration After Entry Statement
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Declaring a variable after an ENTRY statement may cause the compiler to generate
the following error message:

   error F2836: statement out of order

RESOLUTION
==========

Make all the type declarations before all the ENTRY statements to avoid this
error message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS,
version 1.0. This problem has been resolved with FORTRAN Powerstation
maintenance release version 1.0a for MS-DOS.

FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0 can be differentiated from the maintenance
release version 1.0a by invoking the linker. Typing "link32 | more" (without the
quotation marks) from \F32\BIN directory will show version 2.8 for FORTRAN
Powerstation version 1.0, and it will show 1.0f for the maintenance release
version 1.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Compiling the following code demonstrates the problem:

Sample Code
-----------

   C No options required
         subroutine sub(x)
         entry suben(x)
         real x
         end
   C The compiler generates the following incorrect error:
   C error F2836: statement out of order

This error message can be avoided by moving the declaration for x above the ENTRY
statement but below the subroutine statement.
