TITLE   :DoubleSpace Maintenance Program Does Not Display All Drives
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

When you compress an existing drive or create a new compressed drive using the
DoubleSpace maintenance program, some of your drives may not appear in the list
of available drives.

CAUSE
=====

The DoubleSpace maintenance program does not display drives that do not have
sufficient free space to be compressed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, ensure the disk you want to compress has enough
free disk space. To determine how much space is required, refer to the following
table:

   Disk Type                                     Free Space Required
   ---------                                     -------------------

   Non-Boot Disk (compressed from command line)        1.13 MB
   Non-Boot Disk (compressed from                      1.13 MB
                  DoubleSpace Manager)
   Boot Disk (compressed from command line)            1.45 MB
   Boot Disk (compressed from command line)            1.63 MB
   Floppy Disk                                         1.10 MB

NOTE: MS-DOS 6.2 Help contains incorrect numbers for free space required if you
are attempting to compress a boot disk.

For more information, type "help dblspace /compress" (without the quotation
marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.
