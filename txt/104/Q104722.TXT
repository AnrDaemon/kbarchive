======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using MS-DOS Delete Sentry and the setting ARCHIVE=FALSE has been
changed to ARCHIVE=TRUE in the UNDELETE.INI file, some files may not be backed
up in the SENTRY directory.

CAUSE
=====

If you set the ARCHIVE= setting in the UNDELETE.INI file to TRUE, the only files
that are stored in the SENTRY directory are those that have the Archive
attribute set. Any files that do not have the Archive attribute set at time of
deletion are not stored in the SENTRY directory and cannot be recovered using
Undelete Delete Sentry (UNDELETE /S).

WORKAROUND
==========

There is a possibility that the file may be recovered using the standard MS- DOS
method of recovering files (UNDELETE /DOS).
