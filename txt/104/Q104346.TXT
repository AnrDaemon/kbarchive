SUMMARY
=======

Accessing and using general fields with RQBE has a few limitations. Although
general fields are available through the RQBE interface and for selection
output, general fields cannot be used to set join conditions. The interface will
allow it, but when the query is executed, the following error message appears:

   Illegal operation for a general field

If an ORDER BY or GROUP BY clause is issued on a general field, it follows the
same rules as above, but it gives one of the following error messages when
executed:

   SQL invalid ORDER BY

   -or-

   SQL invalid GROUP BY

Additional query words: VFoxWin FoxWin 2.50 errmsg err msg
