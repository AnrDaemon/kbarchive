XTree Gold version 2.5 by XTree Company may perform screen redraws
very slowly while running in a window under Windows NT. In order to
correct this problem, the configuration of XTree needs to be changed.

There are two ways to get to the XTree Configuration screen:

1. While in XTree, press ALT+F10.

2. At the Command Prompt, run XTG_CFG.EXE from the XTree directory (C:\XTGOLD is
   the default).

Once you are in the XTree Configuration screen follow these steps:

1. Select menu item 1, Modify Configuration Items.

2. On the next screen, select Next Page.

3. You should now be on Page 2 in Configuration Items. In the Display section,
   change option 2, Display is "flicker free," to Yes. Use ENTER to toggle
   between Yes and No.

The "flicker free" setting in XTree is used to correct some display
problems like snowy or flickering lines that occur with some display
adapters. This setting will effect the speed at which the screen is
redrawn.

NOTE: If you are running Windows NT version 3.5 and the display flicker
free is set to Yes, the system can stop functioning. The only option is to
power down.

XTree Gold is manufactured by the XTree Company, a vendor independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this product's performance or reliability.
