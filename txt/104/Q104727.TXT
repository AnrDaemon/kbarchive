-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


EMM386.EXE version 4.48 does not enable HIGHSCAN for some AMI BIOS.

CAUSE
=====

EMM386.EXE checks the AMI BIOS date and does not enable HIGHSCAN if the BIOS
date is one of the following:

   04/25/91
   05/05/91
   07/07/91
   06/01/92

These AMI BIOS chip sets use the F000h-F7FFh upper memory area (UMA) range and
are therefore incompatible with HIGHSCAN.

Additional query words: 6.22 6.20 mem maker memmaker 4-25-91 7-07-71 5- 05-91 date dates high scan f000-f7ff
