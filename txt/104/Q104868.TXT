TITLE   :Backup Err Msg: Invalid Volume Information Block Detected
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.21,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when rebuilding a catalog using
Microsoft Backup for Windows (MWBACKUP.EXE) if you are using the last disk of
the backup set to rebuild the catalog.

   Invalid Volume Information Block Detected. The component cannot be used.

CAUSE
=====

This error message may occur if the backup set was created using the BACKUP
command from a version of MS-DOS earlier than 6.0.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correctly restore the backup set, you must use the RESTORE.EXE command from
MS-DOS versions 6.0 and later. For information on using RESTORE, type "help
restore" (without the quotation marks) at an MS-DOS command prompt.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error is not generated when using MS-DOS versions 6.0 and later Microsoft
Backup for MS-DOS (MSBACKUP.EXE) to rebuild the catalog. Backup for MS-DOS
correctly determines that the backup set was created using the previous MS-DOS
BACKUP command and displays the appropriate error message. Also, if any disk
other than the last disk is used to rebuild the catalog in Backup for Windows,
then it too correctly determines that the backup set was created using a
previous MS-DOS BACKUP command and displays the appropriate error message.

Additional query words: 6.00, 6.20, 6.21, 6.22 BACKUP.EXE
