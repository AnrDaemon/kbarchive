TITLE   :DBLSPACE ERR Msg: Invalid DBLSPACE.INI Setting: SWITCHES=/N
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you modify the DBLSPACE.INI file with the DBLSPACE /SWITCHES command in
MS-DOS 6.2 and then uninstall 6.2 and use MS-DOS 6.0, you receive one of the
following error messages when you boot your computer:

   Invalid DBLSPACE.INI setting: SWITCHES=/N
   Invalid DBLSPACE.INI setting: SWITCHES=/F
   Invalid DBLSPACE.INI setting: SWITCHES=/FN

CAUSE
=====

These switches are not valid for the MS-DOS 6.0 DBLSPACE.INI file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, edit the DBLSPACE.INI file and then add the
switches to the CONFIG.SYS file. For example:

1. Use the ATTRIB program to clear the DBLSPACE.INI file attributes. For
   example:

      attrib -r -h -s h:\dblspace.ini

   To determine which drive is your host drive, type "dblspace /list" (without
   the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

2. Using MS-DOS Editor, edit the DBLSPACE.INI file and remove the SWITCHES
   entries.

3. Save the DBLSPACE.INI file.

4. Edit the CONFIG.SYS file on drive C and add the SWITCHES entries.

5. Save the CONFIG.SYS file and exit MS-DOS Editor.
