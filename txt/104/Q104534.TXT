PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.21,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have an Adaptec 1542B SCSI disk, a SCSI CD-ROM drive, and ASPI4DOS.SYS is
loaded when you install MS-DOS, you may receive the following error message:

   Hard disk not readable

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when Setup thinks the CD-ROM drive is the boot drive. This
problem occurs when you have the CD-ROM drive and the SCSI drive set to #0 and
#1, respectively.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Remove the disk from the CD-ROM drive, restart your computer, and run Setup.

 - Remove ASPI4DOS.SYS from the CONFIG.SYS file, restart your computer, run
   Setup, put ASPI4DOS.SYS back in the CONFIG.SYS file, and then restart your
   computer again.

 - Reconfigure the CD-ROM drive so it uses a SCSI ID other than 0 or 1.
