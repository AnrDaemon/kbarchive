If you download files with FTP from a UNIX or Internet server, the files
may be in tape archive (TAR) format, which is a storage method that saves
disk space. These files will not be usable unless they are restored to
their native format.

Both TAR and COMPRESS are standard utilities for concatenating files and
compressing files for storage on UNIX systems. They also provide the
facilities to restore files to their native format.

Windows NT does not include either the TAR or Compress utilities; however,
they are available through several sources including several different
anonymous FTP sites on the Internet.

TAR files can be processed using the PAX command that ships with Windows
NT.

NOTE: You cannot use PKUNZIP to uncompress a file compressed by the UNIX
COMPRESS utility.
