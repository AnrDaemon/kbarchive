SUMMARY
=======

The following information concerns GDI's simulation routines for device
drivers:

GDI discards its simulation routines when more intelligent drivers provide the
required information. GDI is demand-loadable and discardable. When a smart
driver registers its capabilities with GDI, GDI dumps the simulation routines
that it uses for less intelligent display drivers. For example, when writing a
driver that can handle all the OUTPUT functions, GDI will avoid loading all the
simulation routines.

In addition, GDI's simulation routines are optimized. However, it is usually the
case that device drivers can complete output functions a lot faster because no
GDI object or memory must be allocated during the operations, and device drivers
can deal directly with the hardware device.
