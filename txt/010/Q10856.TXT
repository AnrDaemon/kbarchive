SUMMARY
=======

When running a Windows-based application with multiple instances, check
hPrevInstance if you need to know if your instance is the first instance. If it
is NULL, this is a new instance of static data; if it is not NULL, it is not a
new instance of static data. You can give the instance a unique name by doing
either of the following:

1. Use CreateWindow() and give it a unique name.

2. Use GetWindowLong() to access the CREATSTRUCT structure passed when
   processing a WM_CREATE message and specifically change the lpszName field (if
   you want to change the caption name on the existing, already named instance).

You cannot change the icon name dynamically. You should use the second method to
update the icon name from untitled to a unique name.
