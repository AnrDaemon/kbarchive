 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Placing a comma in the text you type into the "Setup dialog box caption" text
box in step 4 of the Setup Wizard causes the following error:

   <setup name> Setup was not completed successfully.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not use a comma character in the "Setup dialog box caption" text box in step
4 of the Setup Wizard.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug has been fixed in the updated version of the Setup Wizard Vfp6swiz.exe
dated 10/08/1998. This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you run the Setup Wizard and place a comma in the "Setup dialog box
caption" text box, the Setup Wizard continues and builds the disk images.
However, when you run the Setup routine and select OK in the "Change Folder"
window, the error occurs.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. From the Tools menu, point to Wizards and then choose Setup. In the Microsoft
   Visual FoxPro dialog box, click Locate Directory and then in step 1 select a
   folder that has an .exe or .app file.

2. Make any selection in step 2 and then, in step 3, point to the folder in
   which you want the distribution disks created.

3. In step 4, type "Mysetup, Files" (without the quotes) in the "Setup dialog
   box caption" text box and type anything in the Copyright information text
   box.

4. Click Finish twice to create the setup disks.

5. Go to the destination folder and run the Setup.exe file in the Disk 1 folder.

6. Continue through the setup routine by selecting the Continue and OK buttons,
   and note that the error occurs.

7. Run the Setup Wizard again, taking the comma out of the "Setup dialog box
   caption" text box, and note that the distribution installation completes
   successfully.
