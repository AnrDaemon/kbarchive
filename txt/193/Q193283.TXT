SYMPTOMS
========

If you send a meeting request to another user, use the Move Server Wizard to
move the Microsoft Exchange Server computer on which your mailbox is located to
a different site, and then send a meeting update to the other user, you may
receive a non-delivery report (NDR).

When you send the meeting update under these conditions, the attendee's X.400
address contains a blank common name (/cn=) field. This prevents the server from
delivering the meeting update.
