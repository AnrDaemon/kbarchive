The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0, on platform(s):

SUMMARY
=======

Visual Basic 6.0 applications cannot run on the Windows NT 3.51 platform. The
Visual Basic 6.0 run-time libraries check for the version of the running
operating system; if the Windows NT 3.51 operating system is recognized, the
application will not be allowed to start.

The documentation under Section "System Requirements for Visual Basic
Applications" in Appendix A "Visual Basic Specifications, Limitations and File
Formats" of "Visual Basic 6.0 Programmer's Guide", states that Visual Basic 6.0
applications can run on Microsoft Windows NT 3.51, this is incorrect.

Please refer to the correct system requirements at the back of the Visual Basic
6.0 software package.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Attempting to run an application created with Visual Basic 6.0 on a machine with
Windows NT 3.51 installed, results in the following error:

   Wrong version of operating system, Requires Windows NT 4.0 (build 1381
   with Service Pack 3 or above), or Windows 95 (build 708 or above)
