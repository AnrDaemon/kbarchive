version 1.2.

The third-party products discussed here are manufactured by vendors independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, perform the following steps on the Systems Management
Server site server:

1. In the <SMS_root_directory>\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\X86.bin
   directory on the site server, replace the Invos2.exe file with the version
   obtained from the hotfix.

   NOTE: You can perform Step 1 automatically by using Hotfix.exe with the
   provided Hotfix.ini file.

2. The file will be replicated at the next Maintenance Manager work cycle to all
   Systems Management Server logon servers to the SMS\Logon.srv\X86.bin
   directory. When that occurs, the clients can be updated.

   To update the clients, either manually run Upgrade.bat on each client, or
   follow the instructions in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
   Base:
