Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new ActiveX EXE project in Visual Basic. Class1 is created by
   default.

2. Add the following code to Class1:

         Private Sub Class_Initialize()
            Err.Raise vbObjectError + 1024
         End Sub

3. In the Project Properties, set the Project Name to MyServer.

4. Save the project as MyServer.vbp, and then make MyServer.exe.

5. Create a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

6. Add the following code to Form1 in the new Standard EXE project:

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            Dim oServer As Object
            On Error GoTo Err_Init

            Set oServer = CreateObject("MyServer.Class1")
            Exit Sub

         Err_Init:
             Set oServer = Nothing
         End Sub

7. Run the standard EXE project, and then close it.

   In Windows 95 or Windows Me, press the CTRL+ALT+DEL key combination to open
   the Close Programs dialog box.

   -or-

   In Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000, press the CTRL+ALT+DEL key combination, and
   then click Task Manager.

   Note that MyServer.exe is still in memory.
