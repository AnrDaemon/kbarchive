TITLE   :Stop 0x0000002E Using Qlogic Driver Version 2.29
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a Qlogic SCSI adapter (with the Qlogic driver version 2.29) and you
modify the NumberofRequests registry value to a number greater than the default
of 128, the system generates the following blue screen error message:

   STOP: 0x0000002E (0xFACEFEED, 0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x80ADD9C8)
   DATA_BUS_ERROR

NOTE: The four parameters inside the parentheses will vary according to the
configuration of the system.

This value does not normally appear in the registry and must be added manually to
change the default setting of 128.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
