TITLE   :XFOR: Date/Time Stamps Not Preserved on Migrated Notes Messages
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When migrating users from a Lotus Notes or Domino Server, you may notice that
the date and time stamps are not preserved on some messages.

CAUSE
=====

This will often occur with messages that are in the Drafts folder when the user
is migrated.

During migration, if the PostedDate or DeliveredDate attributes are not defined
on a note in the user's Notes mail database, then the received date in Exchange
Server defaults to the time and date of migration. This is true for any note
that hasn't been posted or delivered, including:

   Appointments
   Reminders
   Anniversaries
   Events
   Tasks

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 1.
