TITLE   :SMS: Despooler Reports Out of Disk Space in Event Log
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDespooler smsdespooler

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When redistributing a package, despooler may report out of disk space in the
application event log (Event 109) even though there is sufficient disk space. In
addition, the package will not be copied to the distribution point.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur if a file that already exists in the distribution share
point is open or in use when that file is being recopied.

WORKAROUND
==========

Restarting the computer that contains the open file will clear file contention
issues. If the problem occurs again, it may be necessary to troubleshoot
conflicts with backup software, antivirus software, and the file system.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following event will appear in the Windows NT application event log:

      Event 109
      Failed to install package. There isn't sufficient disk space on package
      server \\<Server>\<Share>\<PackageID>. Disk space available on that
      server is megabytes, space required is megabytes.

Note that <Server>, <Share>, and <PackageID> above will be the
name of your server, your package distribution share, and the ID of the package
you are sending.

Also note that the amount of disk space required and disk space available is
reported as null, or blank.

In the despooler log file, Despool.log, an error similar to the following error
will be logged:

      ~Copying E:\_S M0000.TMP\filename.EXE to
      E:\SMS_PKGE\DOG0005D\filename.EXE, Failed, Win32 Error = 32
      $$>SMS_DESPOOLER><Thu Sep 10 09:55:37 1998~><thread=1D0>

This error identifies the file that could not be copied. Win32 Error 32 indicates
that the process cannot access the file because it is being used by another
process. The file is in use.

Event 109 should indicate that there is a file contention error, or that the file
is in use, not that there is a disk space problem.
