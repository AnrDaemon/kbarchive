SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to send the SQL database used by version 3.2 of
LinkAge Directory Exchange (LDE) to a Microsoft support professional.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are times when it may become necessary to send a copy of the LinkAge LDE
SQL database into Microsoft so a support professional can look at it. To save
the SQL database with information to allow it to be reloaded for
troubleshooting, follow these steps:

1. Using the SQL Enterprise Manager, set up a disk-based backup device called
   LDEDump. This is accomplished by opening the property tree for the LDE SQL
   server in the SQL Enterprise Manager. Under the property tree, right-click on
   the folder called Backup Devices. Select "New Backup Device."

2. Using ISQL/w under the Query window, type:

   sp_helpdb lsdxmmd

   And run this by clicking Query, then Execute from the menu bar. This will
   return the database properties for Lsdxmmd. Save the results into a .rpt file
   called LDEDump.RPT by selecting Save As on the File menu.

3. Using ISQL/w under the Query window, type:

   dump database lsdxmmd to LDEDump

   And run this by clicking Query, then Execute from the menu bar. This will dump
   the contents of the Lsdxmmd database into the file defined by the backup
   device created earlier, called LDEDump. By default, the backup device will be
   created in the Mssql\Backup directory with a .dat file extension.

4. Compress the file defined by the backup device, LDEDump, and LDEDump.rpt into
   one ZIP file. The Microsoft support professionals will give you a name for
   this file and tell you how to upload or mail the file to them.
