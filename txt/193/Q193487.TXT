 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0SP1, 3.0SP2, 3.0SP3, 4.0, 4.0SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server supports LU6.2 session security, where a hex or character security
key is configured as part of the Remote APPC LU definition. When you use the
SNACFG command-line tool to display the configuration, this security key is
displayed in clear text, which compromises security.

CAUSE
=====

The SNACFG command-line tool was designed to display the full Remote APPC LU
definition, including the session security key.

RESOLUTION
==========

--------------

3.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0 (through
SP3) and SNA Server version 4.0 (through SP1). This problem was first corrected
in SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION

The updated Snacfg.exe command-line tool behaves as follows:

 - The encrypted key may now be input and output using the new /SECURITYEX:
   option.

 - The unencrypted security key (/SECURITY option) is no longer displayed.

 - It is still possible to enter an unencrypted key using the /SECURITY option.
