TITLE   :W3SVC Counters Fail after a Successful Install
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Although Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 appears to be installed
correctly and the registry appears to be configured correctly to load
W3ctrs.dll, the Web Service counter does not appear in performance monitor. This
occurs whether you are running perfmon locally on the system or monitoring it
remotely.

The counters appear on the computer when everything is initially installed, but
within a few hours of activity, they do not appear. From that time on, they do
not appear even after restarting the computer and attempting to reload the
counter DLL.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
version 4.0. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0
and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 4.

Additional query words: perfmon, counters, administration, remote, w3svc, analysis
