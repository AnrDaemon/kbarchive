The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

After you remove files, queries against Index Server still return links to the
deleted files.

CAUSE
=====

When Index Server catalogs a document, if the document has both a long filename
and a short (8.3) filename, both filename entries are indexed. However, when you
delete a file from the file system, only a notification to remove the short
filename from the catalog occurs. The entries for the long filename stay in the
catalog.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Windows 2000 Indexing Service.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

To work around this problem, change the value of
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Filesystem\DisableNTFS
8dot3NameCreation to 1. This disables the creation of 8.3 (short) filename
entries for long filename entries. Be aware that this may have a negative effect
on Legacy applications.

STATUS
======

This problem has been corrected in Windows 2000 Indexing Service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Legacy clients (particularly Windows 95 SR1 and earlier) will stop
responding when accessing a network share on the server where the
Disablentfs8dot3namecreation registry change has been applied. For more
