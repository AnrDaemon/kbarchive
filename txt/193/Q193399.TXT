TITLE   :BUG: TabStrip Loses Selection When Placement Property is Changed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When changing the Placement property of a TabStrip control (Placement determines
the location of the tabs: top, bottom, right, left), the TabStrip may lose track
of which Tab is selected. The selected Tab should not change when the Placement
is changed.

RESOLUTION
==========

The workaround for this problem is straightforward. Because the TabStrip may not
retain the selected tab properly, you must do it programmatically. This value
can be stored in a variable at the beginning of the procedure (or before
changing the Placement property), and then restored at the end of the procedure
(or after changing the Placement property). The following code will fix the
problem as presented in step 7 of the Steps to Reproduce Behavior section of
this article:

      Dim objSaveTab As Object
      With TabStrip1
         Set objSaveTab = .SelectedItem
         If .Placement = 3 Then
            .Placement = 0
         Else
            .Placement = TabStrip1.Placement + 1
         End If
         Set .SelectedItem = objSaveTab
         Debug.Print .SelectedItem
      End With

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created default.

2. Add the TabStrip component to the toolbox by selecting Components from the
   Project menu, checking "Microsoft Windows Common Controls 6.0," and then
   clicking OK.

3. Add an instance of the TabStrip to Form1.

4. Add a second tab to the TabStrip.

5. Set the Caption property of Tab1 to "One" and the Caption of Tab2 to "Two."

6. Add a CommandButton to Form1.

7. Add the following code to Form1:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            With TabStrip1
               If .Placement = 3 Then
                  .Placement = 0
               Else
                  .Placement = TabStrip1.Placement + 1
               End If
               Debug.Print .SelectedItem
            End With
         End Sub

8. Run the project and click on the tab labeled "Two."

9. Click the CommandButton twice and note that the selected tab (printed in the
   Immediate Window) changes from Two to One.
