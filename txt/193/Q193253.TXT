TITLE   :BUG: HalfHeightCaption Form Causes Small Empty Control Menu
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run a top-level form with the HalfHeightCaption property set to true
(.T.) and you minimize the form, right-clicking the form icon on the system task
bar causes a small empty control menu to display.

RESOLUTION
==========

Here are the two workarounds for this problem:

Method 1
--------

Create the form using the following code example:

      PUBLIC oform  && If run from a program file.
      oform = CREATEOBJECT('form1')
      oform.Show()
    
      DEFINE CLASS form1 AS form
         ShowWindow = 2
         AutoCenter = .T.
         HalfHeightCaption = .T.
         Name = "Form1"
         Caption = "Form1"
      ENDDEFINE

Method 2
--------

If the form is created with the Form Designer, place the following code in the
Deactivate and Paint events of the form.

In the Deactivate event:

      DoDefault()
      IF Thisform.WindowState = 1
         Thisform.HalfHeightCaption = .F.
         Thisform.Icon = Thisform.Icon
      ENDIF

In the Paint event:

      IF Thisform.WindowState = 1
         Thisform.HalfHeightCaption = .F.
      ELSE
         Thisform.HalfHeightCaption = .T.
      ENDIF

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior does not occur if the form is created using code instead of the
Form Designer.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form named Myform.

2. Set the two following properties of the form:

         HalfHeightCaption = .T.
         ShowWindow = 2 - As Top-Level Form

3. Save and run Myform.

4. Click the minimize button to minimize the form.

5. In the System Taskbar, right-click the icon to display the control menu. A
   small empty control menu displays.
