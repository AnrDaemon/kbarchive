TITLE   :FIX: Passing Array to Init with Addobject Passes First Element
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to add an object at run-time to a second object with the second
object's AddObject method, the added object receives an array as a parameter to
it's Init method. Then when you attempt to pass the array to the Init method by
reference, it is not passed as an array, instead the first element is passed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code from a program (.PRG) file:

         LOCAL loCustObj, laTest[3]

         Clear

         * Populate array.
         laTest[1] = 'One'
         laTest[2] = 'Two'
         laTest[3] = 'Three'

         * Pass array to cst1 Init by reference in CREATEOBJECT()
         loCustObj = CREATEOBJECT('cst1', @laTest)

         * Pass array to cst1 Init by reference in AddObject()
         loCustObj.AddObject('cst2','cst1', @laTest)

         ?loCustObj.aprop[2]
         ?loCustObj.cst2.aprop[2]

         DEFINE CLASS cst1 AS custom

            DIMENSION aprop[1]

         PROC Init
            LPARAMETER taArray
            * Error "'TAARRAY' is not an array." occurs here from AddObject
            =ACOPY(taArray, this.aprop)
         ENDPROC

         ENDDEFINE

An error dialog displays with the following error:

   'TAARRAY' is not an array.

This occurs on the ACOPY() function, when the array is being passed from the
AddObject() method. The array is passed correctly from the CREATEOBJECT()
function. The array is passed correctly from the AddObject() method under Visual
FoxPro 6.0.

If you wish to pass an entire array instead of a particular element to a method
or function in Visual FoxPro, you must pass it by reference. This is
accomplished by preceding the arrayname with an @ sign, or using the SET UDFPARM
command.
