TITLE   :Medium Protocol Level Logs Same Data as Maximum
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the diagnostic level is set to Medium, SMTP Protocol Log contents should
include only the "SMTP commands and headers," yet the entire data packets of the
message can be seen. This information should only be visible when the diagnostic
level is set to Maximum, according to Appendix B, page 676, of the Microsoft
Exchange Server Administrator's Manual. Currently, there is no difference in the
way protocol logging appears for the Medium or Maximum levels.

RESOLUTION
==========

Apply the latest service pack for Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For
information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
