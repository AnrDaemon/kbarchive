TITLE   :Simulated RTC Presents the Century Byte with 19 Instead of 20
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbYear2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The simulated Real Time Clock (RTC) will always present the century byte
representing 19 instead of 20 in the 21st Century. This causes MS-DOS-based
programs that access the Real Time Clock to receive the wrong date. For example,
the year 2000 is interpreted as the year 1900.
