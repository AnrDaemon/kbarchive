TITLE   :XADM: NDR When Message Is Routed Between Multiple Connectors
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you send a message through a connector on a Microsoft Exchange Server
computer, and the message is routed through another connector to reach one or
more recipients, you may receive a non-delivery report (NDR). For example, if
you send a message through the Internet Mail Service, and the message is routed
through the Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail to reach one or more cc:Mail
recipients, you may receive an NDR. This problem can also occur with the
Exchange PROFS Connector, Exchange Notes Connector, and Exchange SNADS
Connector.

However, if the message is also sent to a user on the Microsoft Exchange Server
computer, and that user replies to all the original recipients, the reply is
successfully sent to the recipient on the foreign system.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the information store does not set the Internet message
ID (PR_INTERNET_MESSAGE_ID property) correctly.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
