SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply an Exchange Server 5.5 post-SP1 hotfix to the store component
(any build between 2232.x and 2402.0 of Store.exe), users may be unable to reply
to messages in their Inbox. When users reply to a message, the From: field
automatically appears in the message header and is populated with the name of
the originator of the message. Attempting to send this reply results in an
"access denied" error message.

version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
