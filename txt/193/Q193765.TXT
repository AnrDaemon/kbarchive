TITLE   :HOWTO: Using Visual FoxPro Online Help Without Installing MSDN

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Previous versions of Visual FoxPro used a WinHelp implementation for online
help. Since WinHelp is included as part of the operating system, it is possible
to simply copy a Windows help file (*.hlp) to the system and expect to be able
to view the contents of the help file. Visual FoxPro 6.0 uses the HTML Help
system for online context-sensitive help. In order to be able to view the HTML
Help file for Visual FoxPro (FoxHelp.chm), the correct version of the HTML Help
engine must be present. This article describes how to configure a system with
the necessary version of the HTML Help engine without having to install the
Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Configuring the System with the HTML Help Engine
------------------------------------------------

1. Insert the Visual FoxPro 6.0 CD or Visual Studio 6.0 Disk 1 CD.

2. Open the HTMLHelp folder on the CD.

3. Double-click the Htmlhelp.exe file.

4. Proceed through the HTML Help Workshop Setup.

5. Choose Custom Setup when given the option.

6. Choose only HTML Help in the Custom Setup options dialog box.

7. Complete the installation.

Once you have installed the HTML Help engine, you can view HTML Help files on
this system. You can configure Visual FoxPro to use the help file directly from
the CD, or you can copy the help file (FoxHelp.chm) to your Visual FoxPro
directory. Use the Visual FoxPro Options dialog box to configure the location of
the help file.

It is important to recognize that this method of installing online help for
Visual FoxPro 6.0 is far from complete. This method enables you to view the
Visual FoxPro help topics contained in the Foxhelp.chm file, but it does not
provide online help for common components, such as ActiveX controls, Win32 API
functions, and so forth. To ensure that you have installed all the documentation
for the various components, it is recommended that you install the Microsoft
Developer Network.
