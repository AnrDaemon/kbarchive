TITLE   :TCP/IP Does Not Allow MAC Addresses to Change Dynamically
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFEA kbWinNT400sp4fix kbWinNT400sp4fea

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Service Pack 3 and earlier, if the media access control address of a network
interface card (NIC) is changed dynamically (for example, through kernel mode
drivers), the TCP/IP protocol will not automatically respond to the change.

In Service Pack 4, a new status indication was added so that TCP/IP may respond
appropriately to the change.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
