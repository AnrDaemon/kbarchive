SYMPTOMS
========

Dirsync constantly fails with Fatal 203 errors. Using the Outlook client with
Journaling enabled on a Microsoft Mail for PC Networks postoffice can cause
directory synchronization to fail with the following error message:

   Global Address List not installed on this Postoffice

CAUSE

The Journaling feature polls the postoffice every 2 minutes to get information
updates for the client. If the user does not close the Outlook client when
rebuild is running, this error will occur.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Close all Outlook clients that use Journaling before dirsync occurs.

-or-

 - Do not use the Journaling feature on the Microsoft Mail (PC) postoffice.
