TITLE   :BUG: Recursive History Fails if Used With -f- Switch
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:_IK kbSSafe500bug kbSSafe600bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the SourceSafe History command is used on a project with the -r (recursive)
and -f- (Do Not Display Individual File Updates) switches, the -r switch does
not work correctly.

CAUSE
=====

This problem only occurs when using the -r and -f- switches together.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the SourceSafe Explorer to generate a recursive project history that does
not show file updates.

To accomplish this, clear the "Include file checkins" option in the Project
History Options dialog box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

From the SourceSafe Explorer:

1. Create a project named TestProj under $/, then add a subproject named SubProj
   under TestProj.

2. Add some files to the TestProj and SubProj projects. Next, check out, modify,
   and check in the files to create some history for the files.

From the Command Line:

1. Set the current database with the following command:

        set ssdir = <path to SourceSafe directory>

2. Get the history for the project, $/TestProj in addition to the subprojects
   for $/TestProj with the following command:

         ss history -r -f- $/TestProj

Notice that only the files contained in $/TestProj are listed instead of the
files in both the $/TestProj and $/TestProj/SubProj directories.
