TITLE   :INFO: WhatsThisHelp is Different in Visual FoxPro 6.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The WhatsThisHelp function in previous versions of the Help engine provided a
small pop-up with Help information. Visual FoxPro version 6.0 uses HTMLHelp,
which causes WhatsThisHelp to display the same way as if Help were launched
using the F1 key or from the FoxPro menu.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code demonstrates how WhatsThisHelp displays. The code assumes
that you have Help set to the FoxPro Help file (either Msdnvs98.col or
FoxHelp.chm).

When the form appears, click the WhatsThisHelp icon on the title bar of the form
and then click the form. The ShowWhatsThis Help topic should appear.

Sample Code
-----------

      ***Start of Code
      frmWhatsThisHelp = createobject("xHTMLHelp")
      frmWhatsThisHelp.show(1)

      DEFINE CLASS xHTMLHelp AS form
         Caption = "WhatsThisHelp"
         MaxButton = .F.
         MinButton = .F.
         WhatsThisHelpID = 1342177719
         WhatsThisHelp = .T.
         WhatsThisButton = .T.
      ENDDEFINE
      ***End of Code
