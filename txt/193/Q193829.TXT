======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After a password change is received and processed, a memory leak of 150 bytes
per password change is observed.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT Account Synchronization service is responsible for synchronizing
passwords between a host and a Windows NT domain.

SNAHOSTPROCESS and SNAPMP work together to synchronize host-initiated password
changes. SNAHOSTPROCESS is controlled by the Host Account Synchronization
service. SNAHOSTPROCESS sends host-initiated password changes to SNAPMP via
encrypted RPC. SNAPMP is not releasing the memory allocated for RPC responses
during this process.

RESOLUTION
==========
