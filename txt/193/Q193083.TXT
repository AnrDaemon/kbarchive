TITLE   :PRB: "User-Defined Type Not Defined" Error with Shdocvw.dll Enum
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0

KEYWORDS:kbCompiler kbIE400bug kbVBp kbVBp300 kbVBp400 kbVBp600 kbVS600bug kbWebBrowser kbGrpDSV

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run code that uses the BrowserNavConstants or RefreshConstants
enumeration variables (Enums) on a computer that has Internet Explorer 4.x
installed, you receive the following error message:

   Compiler error:

   User-defined type not defined

However, the same code works on a computer that has Internet Explorer 3.x
installed.

CAUSE
=====

The BrowserNavConstants and RefreshConstants Enums are found in the older
versions of Shdocvw.dll that shipped with Internet Explorer 3.x. However, the
newer versions of Shdocvw.dll that come with Internet Explorer 4.x (and Visual
Studio 6.0) do not contain those Enums.

Therefore, the following code will work on a machine with Internet Explorer 3.x:

      Dim x As BrowserNavConstants

However, if you compile the code on a machine with either Visual Studio 6.0 or
Internet Explorer 4.x installed, you will get the "User-defined type not
defined" error message.
