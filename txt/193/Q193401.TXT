TITLE   :BUG: Can't Change UserControl FontTransparent if Default = False
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the FontTransparent property of a UserControl is programmatically set to
True, the UserControl still behaves as if FontTransparent is set to False. The
actual property value changes but the behavior does not. Once something has been
printed on the control, the FontTransparent can be changed successfully. This
problematic behavior occurs only if the FontTransparent property is set to False
in design mode.

RESOLUTION
==========

The workaround for this problem is to always set the FontTransparent property of
a UserControl to True in design mode. If the design mode value is True, it can
be changed programmatically without incident. If it is set to False, the
problems described above will occur.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created default.

2. Select Add Project from the File menu to add an ActiveX Control project to
   the project group.

3. Assign the Picture property of the UserControl to a large bitmap.

4. Set the FontTransparent property of the UserControl to False.

5. Add the following code to the UserControl's module:

         Private Sub UserControl_Click()
            FontTransparent = True
            Print FontTransparent
            FontTransparent = False
            Print FontTransparent
            FontTransparent = True
            Print FontTransparent
         End Sub

6. Close the UserControl window, and place an instance of the UserControl on
   Form1.

7. Run the project, and click on the UserControl.

8. Note that the first value printed on the control does not exhibit
   FontTransparent behavior.

9. Open the UserControl1 project and change the FontTransparent property of the
   UserControl to True, and then repeat step 7. Note that the behavior is
   correct.
