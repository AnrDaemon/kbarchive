TITLE   :BUG: SET("DATE","TO") Returns "0" Rather Than Valid Setting
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Running the following command returns a zero (0) rather than a valid DATE
variable setting (such as AMERICAN):

      SET("DATE","TO")

The zero might be a one or a two, depending on the date setting.

CAUSE
=====

The SET("DATE") function supports a second argument that reports the date
ordering. This second argument is documented as the number 1 in the Help file.
If the SET("DATE") function detects a second argument, it reports the date
ordering whether this argument is a number, logical, date, character or null
value. Although using something other than the number 1 as the second argument
does not cause an error, it should be avoided. Future changes to Visual FoxPro
could cause the SET("DATE",<not 1>) syntax to create an error.

RESOLUTION
==========

Rather than using the command SET("DATE","TO"), use the command SET("DATE"). If
date ordering is desired, use the SET("DATE",1) syntax.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the following code in the Visual FoxPro Command window to explore the values
returned by the SET("DATE") function when it is given a second argument:

      SET DATE TO "British"
      ? SET("DATE")
      ? SET("DATE",1)   && British dates are ordered DMY, this returns 1.
      ? SET("DATE","Hello")
      ? SET("DATE",.NULL.)
      ? SET("DATE",.F.)
      ? SET("DATE",{05/05/05})
      ? SET DATE TO "YMD"
      ? SET("DATE","TO")

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Run the following code from the Visual FoxPro Command window:

      SET DATE TO "American"
      ? SET("DATE","TO")
      ? SET("DATE")

Notice the difference in what each returns.
