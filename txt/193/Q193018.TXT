TITLE   :INFO: Java and Visual C++ Cannot Access Hidden VB Interface
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Java and Visual C++ programs cannot access hidden Visual Basic interfaces that
are defined with an underscore ( _ ) as the first letter in the name, such as
the Visual Basic Collection interface declared in MSVBVM60.DLL. Problems that
arise from this issue include the following:

 - The interface is hidden (with underscore as the first letter in the name) so
   that tools such as JCOM will skip over it.

 - The interface is only declared in the Visual Basic run-time and there are no
   *.h files and *.java files existing for cross-language implementation.

 - A Visual C++ or Java component cannot return a VB-style collection to a
   Visual Basic component.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you want to gain access to a server that returns a public Visual Basic
collection from Visual C++/Java (which is a very common scenario for in- proc
servers), you have to construct your own Header file or Java file.

Alternatively, you can use an externally-defined interface that does not contain
an underscore as the first letter in the name. Although you cannot use the
components defined in Visual Basic or provided as part of Visual Basic (such as
the Collection object), you can still enable all necessary functionality.
