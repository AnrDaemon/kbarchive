KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A new section named [Do Not Redistribute] has been added to the VB6Dep.ini file
that is used by the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW) to build a Visual Basic
6.0 application distribution set.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following kinds of files are listed under the new section:

 - Files that are not needed at run-time and have no dependencies of their own.

   -and-

 - Files that cannot be redistributed by the PDW due to Microsoft redistribution
   policy. For example, the Microsoft Internet Controls (Shdocvw.dll) cannot be
   distributed using the PDW.

When the PDW creates a distribution set for a Visual Basic 6.0 application, it
checks VB6Dep.ini for any dependency of the files that are included in the set.
It will specifically exclude the files listed under the [Do Not Redistribute]
section when building the set.
