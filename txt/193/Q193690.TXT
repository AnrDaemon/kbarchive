TITLE   :Wildcard Certificate Rule Mappings Disappear
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Wildcard rule mappings may disappear after deleting other wildcard rule
mappings.

CAUSE
=====

Wildcard rule mappings are not re-indexed when a deletion occurs. Any mappings
with an index higher than the index of the deleted mapping will be orphaned from
the list of wildcard mappings, but will still reside in the metabase. When new
mappings are created, a duplicate may appear if it uses a index that correspond
to one of the existing orphaned mappings.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
version 4.0. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0
and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before you apply this fix, install the fix described in Q191385, "Duplicate
Rules Appear in Secure Channel Account Mappings Advanced," to avoid additional
deletion problems in Certmap.ocx.


This fix is not included in the Windows NT Option Pack QFE update.
