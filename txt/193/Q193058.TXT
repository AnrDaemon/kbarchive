SUMMARY
=======

The documentaion does not explain how to correctly use the third parameter
(pBufferLength) of the RasSecurityDialogReceive API.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The documentation does not mention that the third parameter of the
RasSecurityDialogReceive API should be set to the number of bytes expected to be
received before the API is called. Upon API completion, this parameter will have
the number of bytes received (excluding a terminating NULL character).

For example, if the user expects to enter a password up to 10 characters long,
the following code could be used:

      WORD dwBytes = 10;
      gfpRasSecurityDialogReceive ( hPort, pRecvBuf, &dwBytes, 0, hEvent);
      DWORD dwWait = WaitForSingleObject (hEvent, MY_TIMEOUT);
      if (dwWait == WAIT_OBJECT_0)
      {

          // We have received data
          wsprintf (szTemp, "Bytes recevied: %d, buffer received: %s\n",
          dwBytes, pRecvBuf);
      }

For more information about using this API, please refer to the RASHOST sample
located in the Win32 SDK.
