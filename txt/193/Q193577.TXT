KEYWORDS:_IK kbSSafe400 kbSSafe500 kbSSafe600 kbSSExplorer

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0a, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

By design, Visual SourceSafe does not allow you to pin multiple files from
Visual SourceSafe Explorer. You can pin multiple files from the command prompt
using the following command:

   ss pin <path to the files> -V#

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step-by-Step Procedures
-----------------------

To pin an individual file, type the following command at the command prompt:

   ss pin $/project1/first.doc -V1

RESULT: This pins the file first.doc at version 1.

To pin multiple files, separate the file names with a space as follows:

   ss pin $/project1/first.doc $/project1/project11/second.doc -V1

RESULT: This pins the files first.doc in project1 and second.doc in project11 at
version 1.

You can also pin files using wildcard specifications as follows:

   ss pin $/project1/*.doc -V1

RESULT: This pins all the document files under project1 at version 1. Also, you
can use the *.* wildcard to pin all the files under project1.

To pin the files in the subprojects as well, you have to select the Recursive
option. To do this, go to the Tools menu, click Options, and select the Act on
projects recursively check box on the General tab. This adds a line "Recursive =
Yes" in the ss.ini for the current user.

NOTE: The recursive option is set only after you make the changes and close
Visual SourceSafe Explorer.

After you set the recursive option, type the following command:

   ss pin $/project1/*.* -V1

RESULT: This pins all files in project1 and its subprojects at version 1.
