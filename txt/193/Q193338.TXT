TITLE   :PRB: Setting RightToLeft to True Returns Out Of Memory Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to change the "RightToLeft" property of either a Horizontal or
Vertical ScrollBar control to True generates an "Out Of Memory" error.

CAUSE
=====

The RightToLeft property is a design feature in localized Arabic and Hebrew
versions of Visual Basic 6.0 and should have no effect in other language
versions. The above error can be ignored in non-Arabic and non-Hebrew language
versions.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Place either a Horizontal or Vertical ScrollBar control on Form1.

3. Click the control and press the F4 key to bring up the Property Window.

4. Change the value of "RightToLeft" from False to True. This results in an "Out
   Of Memory" error. Further attempts to set the property will result in the
   same error.

   NOTE: In Visual Basic 5.0, any attempt to set the RightToLeft property of
   either the Horizontal or Vertical ScrollBar control will be ignored instead
   of generating an error.
