SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to hide the Security tab of a file or folder when
Windows NT is formatted for NTFS. This may be useful if you do not want other
users to change the permissions on a particular file or folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Rshx32.dll file controls the Security tab. To hide the security tab, change
the permissions of this system file. By default, everyone has read permissions
to this file, and the local administrator has full control rights.

To change the permissions on the file:

1. Log on to the computer running Windows NT Server or Workstation as a local
   user who has Administrator rights.

2. Open Windows NT Explorer and go to Winnt\System32.

3. Search for the Rshx32.dll file.

4. Go to the Properties of this file.

5. Click the Security tab and then click Permission.

6. Remove the Read permission of everyone and then add the appropriate rights to
   the appropriate users or user groups.

7. Restart the computer.

Now, only the users who have been assigned the rights can see the Security tab.
