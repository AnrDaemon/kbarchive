SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Exchange Server to send an e-mail message to a Lotus
cc:Mail custom recipient, you may get a non-delivery report (NDR) message in
your inbox stating:

   To:   e-mail, Recipient
   Subject:   RE: test

   ***  Disk error in creating message item  ***

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a known bug in FX!32 that causes the cc:Mail connector
in Exchange Server to fail while running on an ALPHA server.

The cc:Mail connector uses Lotus' Import.exe and Export.exe, both 16-bit DOS
applications. FX!32 is trapping calls made by these two programs and incorrectly
generating the NDR back to the end user.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform one of the following:

 - Move the cc:Mail connector to an Intel server.

   -OR-

 - Disable or uninstall the FX!32 component.

Additional query words: FX!32, ccmail, NDR, disk error
