TITLE   :XCON: One Recipient Dropped on Exchange DL on Incoming Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT: 5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you send a message from another X.400 mail system to the X.400 address of an
Exchange Server Distribution List (DL), one Exchange Server recipient on the DL
will not receive the message. The expanded list of recipients is correct, but
one Exchange Server recipient will not receive the message. If you ask for
delivery receipts when you send the mail to the Exchange Server DL, you will not
receive a receipt for this one person on the DL.

CAUSE
=====

A logic error exists in DL expansion if the recipients are using the option to
disclose recipients.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
