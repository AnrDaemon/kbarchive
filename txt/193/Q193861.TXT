SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to use SQL Server's query tool to dump the current
propagation table for version 3.2 of LinkAge Directory Exchange (LDE) to
Microsoft.

The propagation table contains sequence and tracking numbers used by the LinkAge
LDE Dirsync Manager (DXM) to set up and organize data sent to and received from
LinkAge LDE agents.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are times when it is necessary to dump the current propagation table of a
Linkage LDE environment to send to Microsoft. To dump the propagation table of
the LinkAge LDE environment, complete the following steps:

1. Open the SQL Server query tool ISQL/w. Verify that LSDXMMD is the selected
   database.

2. Using ISQL/w, in the query window, type the following:

   " setuser 'DXAdmin' " (without the quotation marks)

   Carry out the command by clicking Query from the menu bar, and then click
   Execute. This will set the user to DXAdmin. If this does not complete
   successfully, the next step will not function properly.

3. Using ISQL/w, under the query window type the following:

   " SELECT * FROM propagation " (without the quotation marks)

   Carry out the command by clicking Query from the menu bar, and then click
   Execute. In the Results window, this will return the current propagation
   table for LinkAge LDE. Save the results off into a .rpt file called
   Propagation.rpt by clicking Save As on the File menu.
