TITLE   :SMS: CCM Removes LANDesk Files When Remote Control Isn't Enabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Intel LANDesk Management Suite Remote Control files conflict with the
Systems Management Server Remote Control files; these two Remote Control
packages cannot be installed concurrently on a single client computer. However,
even when Systems Management Server Remote Troubleshooting is not enabled on a
site, the Client Configuration Manager (CCM) will remove the files and registry
keys associated with Intel LANDesk.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. If you are not severely affected by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Systems
Management Server service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information on support costs, please go to the following

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or

   Date       Time    Version      Size    File name    Platform
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   09/24/98   04:01   1.2          365,392 Clicfg.exe   (x86)
   09/24/98   03:59   1.2          914,192 Clicfg.exe   (Alpha)


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The new version of CCM detects the presence of LANDesk by checking for the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\INTEL\LANDESK\WUSER32 registry key. If that registry
key is present, CCM leaves the LANDesk files and registry keys intact if Systems
Management Server Remote Troubleshooting is not enabled on the site.

To install the hotfix, perform the following steps:

1. Replace the Clicfg.exe file in the
   <SMS_root_directory>\Site.srv\<platform>.bin directory with the
   hotfixed version.

   NOTE: You can perform Step 1 automatically by using Hotfix.exe with the
   provided Hotfix.ini file.

2. Reset the site from Systems Management Server Setup. The updated Clicfg.exe
   will be copied to the Systems Management Server logon servers.
