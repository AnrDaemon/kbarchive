TITLE   :BUG: Blinking Hourglass When Expanding Object in Watch Window
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDebug kbVBp kbVBp600bug kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While expanding an object in the Watch Window, the mouse pointer (cursor)
becomes a blinking hourglass, and Visual Basic appears to stop responding.

CAUSE
=====

The run object being expanded contains member objects (clientsessions) that have
run member objects that are the same instance as the parent run. (This is a
circular reference.)

NOTE: The problem appears to only occur with objects that access a Microsoft
Transaction Server (MTS) component.


RESOLUTION
==========

To stop the blinking hourglass, press the CTRL+BREAK key combination. If the
hourglass does not stop blinking, press the CTRL+ALT+DEL key combination to get
to the Close Programs dialog box in Windows 95 and later, or the Task Manager in
NT 4.0 and later. From there, select the program, and click End Task.

To work around the problem, print the information to the Immediate window instead
of the Watch window using one of the following alternatives:

 - Use Debug.Print in the code.

-or-

 - Use the Print method (or ?) directly in the Immediate window.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
