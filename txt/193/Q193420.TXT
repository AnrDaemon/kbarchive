TITLE   :XFOR: Exchange Notes Connector Hangs If Trace Message Enabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a message is sent from Lotus Notes with trace setting on, the message
causes the Notes conversion process on the Exchange Notes Connector to stop with
errors. This impedes all further messages from moving to Exchange Server.

CAUSE
=====

The Notes Router generates trace reports back to the Notes Sender. Because the
Name and Address Book indicates that the user is no longer on Notes, the Trace
Report gets forwarded to Exchange Server, regardless of the fact that it was
sent from Lotus Notes in the first place. The Exchange Notes Connector then
stops responding (hangs) on the actual trace report.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do not enable the Trace Entire Path feature from
the Notes client.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
