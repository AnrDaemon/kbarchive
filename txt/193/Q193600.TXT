TITLE   :Windows NT Load Balancing Service Setup Screen Is Slow to Load
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Load Balancing Service 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Windows NT Load Balancing Service (WLBS) Setup dialog box starts, it
encounters a lengthy delay prior to returning control to the configuration
screen.

CAUSE
=====

The network is unreachable. You entered the final license key when installing
WLBS prior to setting up the TCP/IP configuration and ensuring network access.
The final license key causes the WLBS Setup dialog box to use the network to
resolve the cluster's full Internet name to the primary IP address. If the
network is unreachable, the dialog box will encounter a temporary delay.

RESOLUTION
==========

Be sure to use the initial license key until Windows NT Load Balancing Service
has been installed and network access has been established.

Additional query words: Convoy WLBS
