SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Advanced Find tool in the versions of Microsoft Outlook listed at
the beginning of this article to search one or more folders located on a
Microsoft Exchange Server computer, the search may never finish. This problem
does not occur when you use the Advanced Find tool to search folders located in
a set of personal folders (.pst file) or in an offline storage file (OST).

Note that this problem only occurs when you are using version 5.5.2363.0 or later
of the Emsmdb32.dll file, but earlier than version 5.5.2397.0.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the Emsmdb32.dll file does not notify the server that
the search has finished.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. If you are not severely affected by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.
