TITLE   :INFO: Status Bar Shows Currently Selected Object in Designers
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A new feature of Visual FoxPro 6.0 is that the status bar displays objects
selected in the various designers. The currently selected object in the Form
Designer or Class Designer window is displayed. Also, the currently selected
Data Environment object is displayed in the Form Designer or Report Designer.
When the selection is made, it displays for 5 seconds, then the status bar
clears.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In versions of Visual FoxPro prior to 6.0, there were two ways to determine the
currently selected object. You could look at the object selection handles (the
six small squares around a text box or other control, for instance), or look at
the current object in the Properties Window Object List. Neither of these
readily display the object hierarchy of the selected object on a single line.

Visual FoxPro 6.0 adds an additional cue to make it easier to determine the
selected object and where it falls in the object hierarchy. When an object is
selected, either by clicking the object in the Form or Class Designer window, or
selecting it from the Properties Window Object List, the object hierarchy and
name are shown.

Form or Class Designer Window
-----------------------------

If you are modifying a form, named Form1, which has a container called Container1
with a text box named Text1, the status bar displays the following text:

   form1.container1.text1.

Form or Report Designer Data Environment Window
-----------------------------------------------

If you are modifying a report with a Data Environment holding a cursor called
Cursor1, when the table is highlighted in the Data Environment window, the
status bar displays the following text:

   dataenvironment.cursor1.
