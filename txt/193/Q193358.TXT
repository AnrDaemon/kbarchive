SYMPTOMS
========

The Visual Basic Books Online causes an Invalid Page Fault (IPF) in module
unknown at the address 00DE:00000003. This occurs after installing the Microsoft
Certified Professional (MCP) Pre-Test software for the following book by Sybex:

cause the error to occur:

   By Michael McKelvy

CAUSE
=====

The Sybex software contains a non-released beta version of the Visual Basic
run-time DLL, Msvbvm50.dll (version 6.00.73.22), which replaced any previous
versions during setup.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the problem, you should remove the Msvbvm50.dll file from your
Windows system directory and re-install the correct run-time file. You can
download the latest version of this file from Microsoft. Please see the
following Knowledge Base article for details:
