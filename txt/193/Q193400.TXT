MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created default.

2. Add an ActiveX Control project to the project group by completing the
   following steps:

   a. Select the File/Add project menu option to display the Add Project dialog
      box.

   b. In the New tab, select ActiveX Control.

   c. Click Open to close the Add Project dialog box. UserControl1 is created by
      default.

3. Copy the following code in the Code window of UserControl1, and then close
   all windows associated with UserControl1

         Option Explicit

         Private Sub UserControl_Hide()
            Debug.Print "HIDE"
         End Sub

         Private Sub UserControl_Initialize()
            Debug.Print "INIT"
         End Sub

         Private Sub UserControl_Show()
            Debug.Print "SHOW"
         End Sub

4. Add an instance of UserControl1 to Form1. Set the Index property of
   UserControl1 to 0.

5. Add a CommandButton to Form1.

6. Copy the following code to the Code window of Form1:

         Option Explicit

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            Load UserControl11(1)
            UserControl11(1).Visible = True
            UserControl11(1).Visible = False
         End Sub

7. Press the F8 key to step through each line of code until Form1 appears. After
   Form1 appears, click the Command1 CommandButton and press the F8 key to step
   through each event. Note that the Show event does not execute in response to
   clicking the CommandButton. The expected behavior is for the Show event to
   execute after the Initialize event.
