TITLE   :XFOR: Chat Portals No Longer Connect after Installing SP1
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After installing the Chat Server Service Pack 1 for Exchange Server 5.5, portals
linking previous versions of the chat server no longer work.

Microsoft Exchange Chat Service version 5.5 Service Pack 1 does not support
mixed-version chat networks. You cannot connect a server running this version
with servers running earlier versions of the Chat Service product (Internet Chat
Server 1.0 or Microsoft Exchange Chat Service version 5.5).

Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 with Service Pack 3 and Microsoft
Exchange Chat Service version 5.5 Service Pack 1 must be installed on each
server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Two or more chat server computers may be connected into a network through the
configuration of portals. A portal represents the connection between two chat
servers on a network. Each portal consists of a name, an IP address, a port
number, and a unique server ID number, which identifies the chat server at the
other end of the portal.

One important thing to note is that the Microsoft Exchange Chat server is not
able to communicate with other non-Microsoft Internet Relay Chat (IRC) chat
servers. Each IRC chat network implements the IRC protocol differently.

Additional query words: chatsrv portal sp1
