-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5

SUMMARY
=======

After the Microsoft Exchange Directory Synchronization service (DXA) is started
for the first time, several files appear in the exchsrvr\dxadata subdirectory.
These files are Jet database files related to directory synchronization between
Exchange Server and Microsoft Mail servers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following files are Jet database components for directory synchronization:

 - Xdir.edb. Jet database. Includes mappings list of all transactions that have
   been sent by the DXA.

 - Edb.chk. External checkpoint file that marks the position in the log files at
   which the database is in a consistent state.

 - Edb.log. Write-ahead transaction log for directory synchronization
   transaction.

 - Temp.edb. Log file used to store transactions that are in progress. Temp.edb
   is also used for some transient storage during online compaction.

 - Res1.log and Res2.log. Reserved disk space, so that if the database or log
   file hard disk drive is full, Exchange Server can still be cleanly stopped.

NOTE: The Res1.log and Res2.log files are created with the size of 1,024 KB
instead of 5,120 KB, which is the size for directory and information store
databases' log files.
