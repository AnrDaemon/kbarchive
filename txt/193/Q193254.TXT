KEYWORDS:kbOOP kbvfp600 kbvfp600bug kbVS600sp3fix kbGrpDSFox

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After using the ResetToDefault method to set a custom class array property,
attempting to DIMENSION the array causes a fatal exception error.

RESOLUTION
==========

This behavior only appears to occur with a Visual Class. If you use a
programmatic class, DEFINE CLASS myclass, for example, the fatal exception error
does not occur.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Visual Custom Class called ClassTest with a new array property named
   MyArray(1,1). For example, type the following and add the property in the
   Class Designer:

   CREATE CLASS ClassTest AS CUSTOM OF ResetTest

2. Run the following code:

   ****Start of Code.
   SET CLASSLIB TO ResetTest.vcx
   PUBLIC ox
   ox = CREATEOBJECT('ClassTest')
   ox.ResetToDefault('myArray')
   DIMENSION ox.MyArray[1,3] && The failure occurs here.
   ****End of Code

   *****************************************************************
   * If the following class definition is included in the preceding
   * program, an error does not occur.
   *
   * DEFINE CLASS ClassTest AS CUSTOM
   * DIMENSION myArray(1,1)
   * ENDDEFINE
