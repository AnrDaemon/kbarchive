PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5,5.5 SP1

KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix exc55 exc55sp1

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you send a message that contains a bulleted list of double-byte character set
(DBCS) text to a computer that is running the U.S. version of Microsoft Exchange
Server, and then the message is replied to, some of the DBCS text may not be
displayed correctly when you view the reply in an e- mail client. Note that this
problem only occurs when the reply is received using Post Office Protocol
version 3 (POP3).

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the DBCS text is not converted properly when the
information store converts the message from Rich Text Format (RTF) to Hypertext
Markup Language (HTML).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
