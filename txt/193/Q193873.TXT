======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC for Oracle version 2.5 Build 2.573.2927 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To determine what Oracle components are installed on your system (and the
version of these components) open either the NT.rgs or WIN95.rgs file. These
files are located in the \ORINST directory off the Oracle home directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you need to know what Oracle software components are installed on your system
you can open either the NT.rgs or WIN95.rgs file (depending on which version of
Windows you are using). The .rgs file is a text file that contains information
about what Oracle components are installed on the system. The file looks similar
to the following:

    0 ntinstall     all      "orainst"    "3.3.1.0.0C" "Oracle Installer"
   20 w32tcp80      adp80    "tcp80"      "8.0.5.0.0"  "Oracle TCP/IP Pro
   23 w32nmp80      adp80    "nmp80"      "8.0.5.0.0"  "Oracle Named Pipe
   26 w32util80     all      "util80"     "8.0.5.0.0"  "Oracle8 Utilities
   34 w32rsf80      all      "rsf80"      "8.0.5.0.0"  "Required Support
   47 w32netclt80   net80    "netc80"     "8.0.5.0.0"  "Oracle Net8 Client
   69 w32plus80     all      "plus80"     "8.0.5.0.0"  "SQL*Plus"

There is a lot more information than what you see in the preceding display. The
additional information includes when the installation of the components took
place and a detailed description of the component.

The .rgs files (both NT.rgs and WIN95.rgs) are found in the \ORAINST directory
off the Oracle home directory. The location of the Oracle home directory is
dependent on which drive you install Oracle on and what operating system you
use. For example, the Oracle home directory for a Windows NT installation on
drive C:\ would be as follows:

   C:\ORANT

Therefore, the path for your .rgs file on this installation would be:

   C:\ORANT\ORAINST\NT.RGS

Additional query words: install version
