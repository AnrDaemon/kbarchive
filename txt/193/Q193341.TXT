SYMPTOMS
========

When you have a User Control acting as a container of another User Control, an
error in the embedded control could generate an invalid "Circular dependencies
between modules" error when the program is run.

If you attempt to save the project, you may encounter another error while saving
the container UserControl:

   Error loading c:\windows\temp\vbXXXX.tmp. A control could not be loaded due
   to load error. Continue?

If you click Yes, an Invalid Page Fault may occur.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new ActiveX Control project in Visual Basic. UserControl1 is created
   by default.

2. Add two new User Controls (UserControl2 and UserControl3) to the project.

3. Close the design windows of UserControl2 and UserControl3.

4. From the control toolbox, add an instance of UserControl2 and UserControl3 to
   UserControl1.

5. Close the design window of UserControl1.

6. Paste the following code into UserControl2's code window:

         Private Test As MyTest

7. Press the F5 key to run the program. An error "Circular dependencies between
   modules" occurs. The expected error message should read:

   "User-defined type not defined".
