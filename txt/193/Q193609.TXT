TITLE   :Visual Basic 5.0 Run-time DLL Has Read-only Attribute
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under some conditions, during the installation of the Windows NT 4.0 Option
Pack, the Visual Basic 5.0 run-time dynamic link library (DLL) Msvbvm50.dll is
marked with the read-only file attribute. This causes errors when you run any
setup program created by the Visual Basic Setup Wizard. In some cases, it will
cause an error with components created by Visual Basic that are downloaded into
a browser.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design.

RESOLUTION
==========

To solve this problem, remove the read-only attribute from the Msvbvm50.dll file
on the server.
