TITLE   :DNS Zone Transfer Fails from WinNT Server to UNIX DNS Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When transferring a primary zone from a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 DNS server to a
secondary zone on a UNIX DNS server, the zone transfer may fail if the Windows
NT DNS zone is configured for WINS lookup or WINS Reverse Lookup.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft DNS server may have a WINS or WINS-R (NBTSTAT) record included in
the DNS file, which is not understood by UNIX DNS. This may cause the zone
transfer to fail when the UNIX DNS server reaches the record in the transfer.
The WINS record is the result of configuring WINS Lookup for a zone. The WINS-R
(NBTSTAT) record is the result of configuring WINS Reverse Lookup for a reverse
lookup zone.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is an additional flag that can be set for the WINS and WINS-R (NBTSTAT)
records in the zone transfer file that allow better interoperability with a UNIX
DNS server. To avoid sending the WINS or WINS-R (NBTSTAT) records to DNS servers
that do not have the WINS or WINS-R capability, configure the zone properties to
specify "Settings only affect local server."

The "Settings only affect local server" configuration will insert the LOCAL flag
immediately after the WINS or WINS-R (NBTSTAT) record. For example:

   @  0 IN WINS  LOCAL 1.1.1.1  1.1.1.2
   @  0 IN WINS-R LOCAL domainname.com

On the primary Microsoft NT DNS server, the LOCAL flag keeps the record from
being sent in a zone transfer.

To configure "Settings only affect local server" for a zone that uses WINS
Lookup, perform the following steps:

1. Select the zone and right-click it.

2. Click Properties.

3. Click the WINS Lookup tab.

4. Click to select the "Settings only affect local server" check box.

5. Click OK.

6. Click the DNS menu.

7. Click Update Server Data Files.

To configure "Settings only affect local server" for a zone that uses WINS
Reverse Lookup, perform the following steps:

1. Select the reverse lookup zone and right-click it.

2. Click Properties.

3. Click the WINS Reverse Lookup tab.

4. Click to select the "Settings only affect local server" check box.

5. Click OK.

6. Click the DNS menu.

7. Click Update Server Data Files.
