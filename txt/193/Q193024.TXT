TITLE   :BUG: KEYBOARD Multiple Tabs Do Not Work in Browse Window
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the KEYBOARD command to issue multiple tabs, to programmatically move from
column to column in a Browse window, does not work.

RESOLUTION
==========

Separate the tabs by some non-functional keystroke. For example, to workaround
the problem, you may use these two techniques:

      KEYBOARD
      '{TAB}{CTRL+ALT+RIGHTARROW}{TAB}{CTRL+ALT+RIGHTARROW}{TAB}{CTRL+ALT+
      RIGHTARROW}{TAB}'

   -or-

     #DEFINE TAB '{TAB}{CTRL+ALT+RIGHTARROW}'
     KEYBOARD TAB+TAB+TAB+'{TAB}'

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In the Command window, issue the BROWSE command for a table that contains
   more than four fields.

2. Create a program and enter the following code in the program:

         ACTIVATE WINDOW <Browse name>
         KEYBOARD '{Tab}{Tab}{Tab}{Tab}'

3. Save and run the program.

In Visual FoxPro 5.0x and 6.0, the highlight cursor moves to the next column
instead of to the fourth column. In Visual FoxPro 3.0b, the third column of the
browse appears highlighted. However, In Visual FoxPro 3.0b, if you keyboard less
than three Tabs, it works properly.
