TITLE   :XADM: Information Store's Directory Query Returns LDAP Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the information store performs a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP) query on the directory, an LDAP error may be returned instead of an error
indicating that no matching objects were found.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the information store performs a query based on a
distinguished name (DN) that does not exist in the directory. When the fields in
the search filter are converted to internal values, invalid distinguished names
are not handled properly.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 2.
