SUMMARY
=======

This article demonstrates how to call the _ShellExecute Foundation Class in the
_Environ Visual Class Library.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the _ShellExecute Foundation Class in the _Environ Visual Class
Library to either open or print the file that passed to _ShellExecute. If the
file is found, or if there was no association with the file, you can test the
return value for possible reasons why the ShellExecute failed. A return value
over 32 indicates success.

The following code shows how to print a Microsoft Word 97 document named Test.doc
in the Word97 directory using the _ShellExecute Foundation Class.

Sample Code
-----------

      * Start of code *
      * Program using _ShellExecute class in _Environ library
      *
      * Pass in three parameters:
      *    tcFileName= file to open/print
      *    tcWorkdir = path to file
      *        tcOperation = what to do with the file, Open or Print
      *
      *  Return:   2  - Bad Association (e.g., invalid URL)
      *            29 - Failure to load application
      *            30 - Application is busy
      *            31 - No application association
      *
      *            Values over 32 indicate success
      *
      LPARAMETERS tcFileName,tcWorkDir,tcOperation
      tcFileName = "Test.doc"
      tcWorkDir = "C:\Word"         && Use appropriate directory here
      tcOperation = "Print"
      runapp = NEWOBJECT("_ShellExecute",HOME()+"Ffc\_Environ.vcx")
      retval=runapp.ShellExecute(tcFileName,tcWorkDir,tcOperation)

      IF retval <= 32
         =MESSAGEBOX("ShellExecute was unsuccessful.")
      ENDIF
      * End of code *

You can also use the _ShellExecute Class to run another application. The
following example opens Windows Explorer:

Sample Code
-----------

      * Start of code *
      * Program using _ShellExecute class in _Environ library
      tcFileName = "Explorer.exe"
      tcOperation = "Open"
      retval=runapp.ShellExecute(tcFileName,tcWorkDir,tcOperation)
      IF retval <= 32
         =MESSAGEBOX("ShellExecute was unsuccessful.")
      ENDIF
      * End of code *
