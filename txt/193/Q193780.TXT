TITLE   :XFOR: Message Sent with X.400 One-Off Address Generates NDR
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Exchange Server through
the Exchange Notes Connector using an X.400 one-off address, the message may not
be delivered successfully, and you may receive a non- delivery report (NDR).

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the X.400 one-off address does not contain a leading
slash mark (/). The Exchange Notes Connector requires that X.400 one-off
addresses have a leading slash mark, but Lotus Notes does not allow X.400
one-off addresses to be created in this format.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

   Component: Exchange Notes Connector

   File Name     Version
   -------------------------
   Lsmexif.dll   5.5.2232.19

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 2.
