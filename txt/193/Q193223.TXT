SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to call the MessageBeep() API function to play wave
files associated with the Windows System sound assignment.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The system sound assignments are made through the Sounds icon in the Control
Panel. The MessageBeep() function can accept one of the five functions in the
following list. The definitions for the constants were taken from the
MessageBeep section in the "Visual Basic Programmer's Guide to the Win32 API".

   Constant              Description
   ----------------------------------------------
   0xffffffff            Standard beep
   MB_ICONHAND           System hand sound
   MB_ICONQUESTION       System question sound
   MB_ICONEXCLAMATION    System exclamation sound
   MB_ICONASTERISK       System asterisk sound

The values normally assigned to these constants follow. For the standard beep,
zero can be used.

      #DEFINE MB_OK                 0
      #DEFINE MB_ICONHAND           16
      #DEFINE MB_ICONQUESTION       32
      #DEFINE MB_ICONEXCLAMATION    48
      #DEFINE MB_ICONASTERISK       64

To use the MessageBeep() function, use the DECLARE statement and then call
MessageBeep() with one of the constants. For example:

      DECLARE INTEGER MessageBeep IN Win32API INTEGER
      =MessageBeep(MB_ICONASTERISK)
