SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to use SQL Server's query tool to dump the current
WorkQueue for version 3.2 of LinkAge Directory Exchange (LDE) to a file to send
to Microsoft.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are times when it is necessary to dump the current WorkQueue of a LinkAge
LDE environment to a file to send Microsoft. To do this, perform the following
steps:

1. Open the SQL Server query tool ISQL/w. Verify that LSDXMMD is the selected
   database.

2. Using ISQL/w, under the query window, type the following:

   " setuser 'DXAdmin' " (without the quotation marks)

   Carry out the command by clicking Query from the menu bar, and then click
   Execute. This will set the user to DXAdmin. If this does not complete
   successfully, the next step will not function properly.

3. Using ISQL/w, in the query window, type the following:

   " SELECT * FROM WorkQueue " (without the quotation marks)

   Carry out the command by clicking Query from the menu bar, and then click
   Execute. In the Results window, this will return the current WorkQueue for
   LinkAge LDE. Save the results in a .rpt file called WorkQueue.rpt by clicking
   Save As from the File menu.

Additional query words: LDE Linkage Dirsync
