SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to use SQL Server's query tool to dump the current
schedule for LinkAge Directory Exchange (LDE) version 3.2 to Microsoft.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are times when it is necessary to dump the current schedule of a LinkAge
LDE environment to send to Microsoft. To do so, complete the following steps:

1. Open the SQL Server query tool ISQL/w. Verify that LSDXMMD is the selected
   database.

2. Using ISQL/w, under the query window type:

   " setuser 'DXAdmin' " (without the quotation marks)

   And on the Query menu, click Execute. This will set the user to DXAdmin. If
   this does not complete successfully, the next step will not function
   properly.

3. Using ISQL/w, under the query window type:

   " SELECT * FROM schedule " (without the quotation marks)

   And on the Query menu, click Execute. In the Results window, this will return
   the current schedule for LinkAge LDE. Save the results in an .rpt file called
   Schedule.rpt by selecting Save As on the File menu.
