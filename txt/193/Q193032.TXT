SUMMARY

MORE INFORMATION
================

For a more information on how to print a directory list, see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q65445 Printing Directory Listings from Windows File Manager

SYMPTOMS
========

There is no direct method to print a list of files or directories from Microsoft
Windows NT Explorer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this limitation, you can print the list of files using a batch
file. Or, if the file list is short enough, you can press the ALT+PRINT SCREEN
key combination to copy the active Explorer window, paste the information into
another Windows program, such as Microsoft Paint or Word, and then print the
bitmap from Paint.
