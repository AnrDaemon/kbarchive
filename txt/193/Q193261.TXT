PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you use a For Each to loop over a Variant containing an array of User
Defined Types (UDTs), the following error may occur:

   Run-time error '458': Variable uses an Automation type not supported in
   Visual Basic.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new ActiveX EXE project in Visual Basic. Class1 is created by
   default.

2. Paste the following code into Class1:

         Type MyType
            x As Integer
            y(5) As Integer
         End Type

3. Add a standard module to the project by selecting "Add Module" from the
   "Project" menu.

4. Paste the following code into Module1:

         Sub main()
            Dim x(5) As MyType
            Dim y as Variant
            y = x
            For Each g In y
            Next g
         End Sub

5. Open the Immediate Window by selecting it from the View menu.

6. Type "main" (without quotes) into the Immediate Window and press the ENTER
   key to run the main subroutine. Note that the above error occurs on the For
   Each line.

   NOTE: If you change the line "For Each g In y" to "For Each g In x" so that
   the "For Each" statement will loop through the array X, the correct error
   description "For Each may not be used on an array of user-defined types or
   fixed-length strings" will occur instead.
