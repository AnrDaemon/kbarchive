TITLE   :PRB: Compiling a VB Project Generates "Fatal Error C1083"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to compile a Visual Basic project residing on a network that only
supports 8.3 filenames may generate the following error:

   "fatal error C1083: Cannot open compiler generated file:
   '[path to file]\[projectname]1.OBJ': No such file or directory."

CAUSE
=====

If there are N modules in a project, Visual Basic will create N + 1 object
files; one for each module and one for the project as a whole. The names are
derived from either the module name or, for the project, the EXE name. The name
used is either "<basename>.obj" or "<basename><number>.obj." A
number is added if the base names of the N + 1 files have naming conflicts (such
as test.bas and test.frm).

Therefore, even if the project name may be fewer than 8 characters, the Visual
Basic compiler/linker generates object files with the name
<projectname>1.OBJ when a conflict is detected, resulting in 9-character
filenames.

In a network environment that does not support long filenames, such as a Novell
network, the above error will occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

Create shorter names for your form, module, and project so that if a name
conflict occurs, the appended number will not violate the short filename
requirement of your network environment.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
