SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft has made available an add-in for Microsoft PowerPoint that clones the
active presentation. This cloning process is similar to inserting slides from a
file or using a copy and paste operation in Slide Sorter view. You can use this
add-in to create a corruption-free copy of a presentation that you suspect may
be corrupted.

The Microsoft PowerPoint Presentation Cloning add-in is available as a
self-extracting archive in the Microsoft Download Center. To install this
add-in, download the Cloneme.exe file from the Microsoft Download Center and
then double-click the Cloneme.exe file to start the Setup program.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:
