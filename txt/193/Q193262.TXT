TITLE   :PRB: Quotes Added When Using Write# to Write Numbers to File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When writing numerical data obtained from a database recordset to a text file
using the Write# command, Visual Basic erroneously places quotes around the
numbers.

RESOLUTION
==========

See the workaround as described in the MORE INFORMATION section below.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Select References from the Project menu and check Microsoft DAO 3.5 Object
   Library or Microsoft DAO 3.51 Object Library.

3. Paste the following code into the declarations section of Form1:`

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            Dim wrkJet As Workspace
            Dim dbsNorthwind As Database
            Dim rsInvoices As Recordset
      
            'Create Microsoft Jet Workspace object.
            Set wrkJet = CreateWorkspace("", "admin", "", dbUseJet)
      
            'Open Database object from saved Microsoft Jet database for
            'exclusive use.
      
            MsgBox "Opening Northwind..."
            Set dbsNorthwind = wrkJet.OpenDatabase("Nwind.mdb", True)
            Set rsInvoices = dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("select _
            [Salesperson],[OrderID],[OrderDate],[ProductID] from [Invoices]")
      
            Open "test.tmp" For Output As #1
            Write #1, rsInvoices.Fields("productid").Properties("Value").Value
            Write #1, rsInvoices!ProductID
            Close #1
      
            rsInvoices.Close
            dbsNorthwind.Close
            wrkJet.Close

            Dim a As Long, b As Long
            Open "test.tmp" For Input As #1
            Input #1, a, b
            Msgbox "a=" & a
            Msgbox "b=" & b
            Close #1
      
         End Sub

4. Press the F5 key to run the project. The message boxes "a=24" and "b=0" are
   displayed.

   NOTE: The file test.tmp that is created in the project or default Visual Basic
   directory has the following contents which demonstrates that Visual Basic has
   placed quotes around the number:

         24
         "24"

Workaround
----------

A workaround to this problem is to change the code that writes to the text file
from:

      Write #1, rsInvoices!ProductID

to:

      Write #1, rsInvoices!ProductID.value
