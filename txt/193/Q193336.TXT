======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======


Crystal Reports is not part of the Visual Basic or Visual Studio setup. However,
you can install it from the Visual Basic and Visual Studio CDs.

NOTE: Starting with Visual Basic 6.0, Microsoft has included a new report
generator called the Microsoft Data Report Designer. You may use either the new
Report Designer or Crystal Reports. For more information about the new Report
Designer, please search the MSDN Library included within Visual Studio 6.0 on
the phrase "Microsoft Data Report Designer."

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install Crystal Reports, run Crystl32.exe. The location of Crystl32.exe
depends on which version of Visual Basic or Visual Studio you own. In all cases,
it is in the following relative path:

   \Common\Tools\VB\CrysRept\Crystl32.exe

Use the following table to determine which CD to use:

   Product                        Disk
   -----------------------------------
    Visual Basic Professional      1
    Visual Basic Enterprise        1
    Visual Studio Professional     2
    Visual Studio Enterprise       3

NOTES:

 - The Learning Edition does not include Crystal Reports.

 - The version of Crystal Reports is 4.6.1.0, which is the same version that
   comes with Visual Basic 5.0.

 - Where the Help file (Crw.hlp) refers to Visual Basic 5.0, you can assume the
   same applies to Visual Basic 6.0.

 - The setup program (Crystl32.exe) does not add a shortcut to the Programs menu
   in Windows. To start Crystal Reports, run Crw.exe in the installed folder or
   click Report Designer on the Add-Ins menu in Visual Basic.

 - Microsoft supports installation of the version of Crystal Reports that ships
   with Visual Basic. For usage issues, please contact Seagate Software. For
   additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:
