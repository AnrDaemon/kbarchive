TITLE   :FIX: New Version of RDO 2.0 Breaks VB5 UserConnection Designer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While trying to add queries using the UserConnection Designer in Visual Basic
5.0, you may see an error message stating:

   "Unable to create the type information for this connection". Closing the
   UserConnection Designer at this point may lead to a GPF.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused by installing the latest version of RDO 2.0 that
ships with many of the Visual Studio 6.0 products without installing the latest
version of the UserConnection Designer.

This problem does not occur if the version of the UserConnection Designer that
ships with Visual Basic 6.0 is installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

For Visual Basic 5.0 customers who do not have access to Visual Basic 6.0, the
following file updates the UserConnection Designer so that it will work properly
with the new RDO 2.0 components:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0. This
problem was corrected in version 6.0.
