======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta Virtual Globe 99, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You may be unable to distinguish between features shown in the map legend when
you use the "Earth At Night" map style of Encarta Virtual Globe 99.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Encarta Virtual Globe was designed to take advantage of the higher screen
resolutions and color palettes available with current monitor and display
adapter combinations. As a result, the contrasts in color and tone between Ice
And Sand, Vegetation, and Water are very small in the "Earth At Night" map style
of Encarta Virtual Globe.

To distinguish between features shown in the "Earth At Night" map style of
Encarta Virtual Globe 99, we recommend that you use a screen resolution of 800 x
600 or higher and a color palette of at least High Color (16-bit).
