IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you specify an exact domain match in the Message Filtering dialog box of
the Connections property page of the Internet Mail Service, the following error
message may appear:

   The domain or user name you have specified is invalid.

CAUSE
=====

The routine that handles domain name validation does not account for
"#@<domain>" being a valid entry for this field.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

   Component: Internet Mail Service

   File Name      Version
   -------------------------
   Imcadmin.dll   5.5.2395.0


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you can use the TurfTable registry value to add
exact domain match entries via the registry. To do so, use the following steps.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the TurfTable value under the following key in the registry:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC
      \Parameters
   

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. On the Edit menu, click Multi String, add the domain after the other entries,
   and then click OK.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 1. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server
5.5 Service Pack 2.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Exact domain match entries are valid per the Exchange Server version 5.5 Release
Notes:

For example, a domain specified in the list using the following format prevents
all messages addressed from domain.com from being delivered.

   #@domain.com

A domain specified in the list using the following format prevents all messages
addressed from domain.com and all of its subdomains from being delivered.

   @domain.com

The Message Filtering dialog box currently allows for the following entries:

   user@domain.com
   @domain.com
   #domain.com
   user

In the following two formats, [xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx] represents a valid IP address.

   user@[xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx]
   @[xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx]
