OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbservicepack kbEditor kbide kbVC600bug kbDevStudio kbVS600sp2 kbVS600SP1 kbVS600sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Type Info is requested for the keyword __asm, Developer Studio hangs. If
Developer Studio is set to automatically generate Type Info, this problem can
occur when the mouse is positioned over the __asm keyword; otherwise, Type Info
can be generated manually in one of the following ways:

 - Pressing CTRL+T.

 - Clicking Type Info from the Edit menu.

CAUSE
=====

Developer Studio is caught internally in an endless loop.

RESOLUTION
==========

Force Developer Studio to shut down. Unfortunately, any unsaved information will
be lost.

To shut down Developer Studio:

1. Press CTRL+ALT+DEL.

2. Under Windows NT or Windows 2000, click Task Manager. Windows 95, Windows 98,
   and Windows Millennium Edition (Me) automatically display a Close Program
   dialog box.

3. Click on the Developer Studio icon in the Task list.

4. Click End Task.

5. A message appears informing you that Developer Studio is not responding.
   Click End Task again.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information

automatic Type Info as follows:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

At this point, any type information must be generated manually as described in
the SYMPTOMS section of this article.
