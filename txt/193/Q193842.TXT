TITLE   :XFOR: DXA Does Not Handle Long MAC Mail Addresses Properly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange DXA does not ensure that Mail ALIAS (MAILBOX) names are
truncated to 10 characters. Furthermore, the DXA does not remove invalid
characters such as a comma.

If the total length of the user's alias is more than 10 characters, the names are
discarded and never included in directory synchronization (dirsynch) operations.
The application log shows an error and a warning for each name it discards. For
example:

   Event: 247
   Source: MSExchangeDX
   Type: Error
   Category: MS Mail 3.2
   Description: The e-mail address of the following transaction is not a
   valid format. See previous events logged by the Microsoft Exchange
   System Attendant component for details. The transaction is A User02,
   MacGroovy@GroovyMac MSMAIL:User02, MacGroovy@GroovyMac. (Thread 0)

   Event: 5
   Source: MSProxy
   Type: Warning
   Category: none
   Description: Microsoft Mail address failure. The Mailbox name
   'MS:Microsoft/testproxy/User02, MacGroovy' is not valid. There must be
   1-10 valid characters.

RESOLUTION
==========
