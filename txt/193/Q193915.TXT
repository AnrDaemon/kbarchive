SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses how to troubleshoot problems you may encounter when you
attempt to view Internet content in the Microsoft programs listed earlier in
this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you click a Web link in one of the programs listed earlier in this article,
the program starts your default Web browser to display the Web content. To view
or use Internet features, you must have an active Internet account with an
Internet Service Provider (ISP).

To troubleshoot Internet problems with these programs, use the following
troubleshooting methods.

Check for Error Messages
------------------------

Click a Web link or an Internet feature in Streets, Trip Planner, or Virtual
Globe.

If you receive the following error message

   Internet Explorer cannot open the Internet Site

please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q192441 Expedia Err Msg: Internet Explorer Cannot Open the Internet Site

If your Web browser starts, but you cannot connect to the Internet, proceed to
the "Web Browser Starts but Does Not Connect to the Internet" section later in
this article.

If your Web browser does not start, or if you receive the following error
message, continue with the next troubleshooting method:

   Your browser could not be launched. Close any open application and try again.
   If nothing else is open, re-install your browser and try again.

ISP Requires Proprietary Internet Software
------------------------------------------

If your ISP does not require you to use a proprietary Web browser or dialer,
proceed to the next troubleshooting method.

If your ISP requires you to use proprietary Internet software, upgrade to the
latest version of the ISP software designed for Windows 95 or later, and then
configure the proprietary Internet software as your default Web browser.

NOTE: If the latest version of the proprietary Internet software for your ISP is
not designed for Windows 95 or later, connect to your ISP, and then start the
proprietary browser before you attempt to view Web-based content in any of the
programs listed earlier in this article.

Set a Default Windows 95/98 Web Browser
---------------------------------------

If a Web browser designed for Windows 95/98 is installed on your computer, follow
these steps to set the browser as the default:

1. Start your Web browser.

2. If you are prompted to set the browser as the default browser for Windows
   95/98, click Yes.

   If you are not prompted to set the default browser, follow these steps:
   a. Quit the browser and any other programs that are running, and then
      disconnect from the Internet.

   b. Use the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel to remove and reinstall
      the browser.

   c. Repeat steps 1 - 2.

If a Web browser designed for Windows 95/98 is not installed on your computer,
follow these steps:

1. Download and install the latest version of Microsoft Internet Explorer from
   the following Microsoft Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/download/default.htm

2. Start Internet Explorer.

3. Click Yes to set Internet Explorer as the default browser.

If your Web browser starts, but you cannot connect to the Internet, proceed to
the next method.

Web Browser Starts but Does Not Connect to the Internet
-------------------------------------------------------

If you use a Local Area Network (LAN) to connect to the Internet, contact your
network administrator for information about how to configure the connection and
proxy settings for your browser.

If you use a dial-up connection to connect to the Internet, verify that your
browser is configured to use your ISP dial-up connection. If no dial-up
connection is available, verify that Dial-Up Networking is installed, and then
contact your ISP to obtain information about how to configure your dial-up
connection.
