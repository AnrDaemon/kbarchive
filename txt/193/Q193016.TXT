TITLE   :PRB: Error Compiling VB5 Project Using LPVOID in Type Library
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While compiling a Visual Basic 5.0 project in Visual Basic 6.0, if the Visual
Basic 5.0 project uses a type library that has a function that returns a LPVOID
or a structure that contains a LPVOID field, the following error occurs:

   Compile Error : Variable uses an Automation type not supported in Visual
   Basic

CAUSE
=====

LPVOID is a Typedef to "void *." Visual Basic 6.0 is changed to explicitly
prohibit the use of pointers in structures and as function return values.

RESOLUTION
==========

Avoid using LPVOID as a field in a structure or as a return value in the type
library. Instead, change them to type LONG respectively.

NOTE: Do not change the Typedef for LPVOID to LONG, because that would change the
meaning of LPVOID in function parameters where it is valid and desirable.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
