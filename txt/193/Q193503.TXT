TITLE   :PRB: TABLEUPDATE() Returns .T. When View's SendUpdates is False
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Executing the command TABLEUPDATE(.T.)on a view, with the SendUpdates property
set to False, returns True (.T.).

CAUSE
=====

The TableUpdate() command should return False if the update fails. In effect,
there must be an attempt to update at least one record that fails. When the view
property SendUpdates is set to False, TableUpdate never tries to update any
records, hence, the TableUpdate() returns True.

RESOLUTION
==========

Check the SendUpdates property of the view using the DBGetProp() function, and
apply the TableUpdate() function only in cases where the SendUpdates property is
set to True (.T.).

For example:

      MyVar1=DBGETPROP("MyView","View","SendUpdates")

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior

Place the following code in a program file and run the program in a new
directory:

      CLOSE DATA ALL
      CREATE DATA test1
      CREATE TABLE tbl1 (fld1 c(10),fld2 d)
      FOR i = 1 TO 4
         INSERT INTO tbl1 VALUES (STR(i),DATE())
      ENDFOR
      CREATE SQL VIEW test2 AS SELECT * FROM tbl1
      DBSETPROP("test2.fld1","field","KeyField",.t.)
      DBSETPROP("test2.fld1","field","Updatable",.t.)
      DBSETPROP("test2","view","SendUpdates",.F.)
      USE test2
      UPDATE test2 SET fld1 = 'Testing'
      ?TABLEUPDATE(.T.)
      ?DBGETPROP("test2","view","SendUpdates")
