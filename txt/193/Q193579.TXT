TITLE   :FIX: SSAPI: Mssccprj.scc File Does Not Have SCC_Aux_Path Info
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbSSafe500bug kbSSafe600fix kbVBp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you Get a source-controlled Visual Basic project from Visual SourceSafe
Explorer, the Mssccprj.scc file does not contain SCC_Aux_Path information.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been corrected in Visual
SourceSafe 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you add a Visual Basic project to Visual Sourcesafe, Visual SourceSafe
creates a Mssccprj.scc file in the project folder. The .scc file will have the
following information:

      SCC=This is a Source Code Control file

      [Project1.vbp]
      SCC_Project_Name = "$/KB/KB5", TJAAAAAA
      SCC_Aux_Path=C:\VSS,

SCC_Project_Name is the path to the Visual SourceSafe project the Visual Basic
project is associated with and TJAAAAAA is its physical file name.

SCC_Aux_Path is the path to the Visual SourceSafe database the Visual Basic
project associated with.

However, if you perform a Get Latest Version on the Visual Basic project from the
Visual SourceSafe Explorer, SCC_Aux_Path information is not written in the
Mssccprj.scc file.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open Visual Basic.

2. Create a standard .exe project, and save the project under C:\proj1.

3. Add the project to SourceSafe under $/proj1.

4. Close Visual Basic.

5. Open Windows Explorer, and go to C:\proj1.

6. Open Mssccprj.scc file in Notepad.exe. The following information is in the
   file:

         SCC=This is a Source Code Control file

         [Project1.vbp]
         SCC_Project_Name = "$/Proj1", TJAAAAAA
         SCC_Aux_Path=C:\VSS,

7. Close Mssccprj.scc file.

8. Delete all the files under C:\Proj1.

9. Open Visual Sourcesafe Explorer, right-click the Project $/Proj1, and click
   Get Latest Version.

10. If it is not already there, type "C:\proj1" in the "To" edit box.

11. Repeat steps 6-8, and you will find the following information in the
   Mssccprj.scc file:

         SCC=This is a Source Code Control file

         [Project1.vbp]
         SCC_Project_Name = "$/Proj1", TJAAAAAA
