TITLE   :Naming FPNW Server Same as PDC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use FPNW, do not alter the "_FPNW" extension given the server. FPNW
will name the simulated NetWare server portion of Windows NT after the name of
the Windows NT server it is installed on. For example, if the Windows NT server
is named SMS1, the FPNW server would be named SMS1_FPNW.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It has been noted that having FPNW loaded in two domains and altering the FPNW
extension has caused connectivity issues. Do not rename FPNW servers to match
the PDCs on which they are loaded. Do not alter the "_FPNW" extension, load, and
configure in the normal manner.
