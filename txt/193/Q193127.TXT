SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to set up Microsoft Internet Authentication Server
(also known as Microsoft Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS
Server) for authentication to a third-party ODBC data source. The purpose of
this article is to walk you through the process of setting up a sample ODBC
source (in this case SQL Server is used) and Microsoft RADIUS Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

How to set up a SQL Server 6.5 database for RADIUS authentication:

1. Install SQL Server 6.5 with Service Pack 4.

2. For Language, select 850multi-lingual.

3. For Sort-Order, select "Alternative Directory Order, Case-Insensitive".

4. For Network Options, select Named Pipes.

5. When SQL Server is installed, register the database and create two database
   devices and one database with a name of your choice.

6. Create a new table called "Network_Users"

NOTE: it must be called "Network_Users".
The ODBC table should be in the following format.

   Table Name: Network_Users

   For an Access ODBC Source:

   Name          Type   Size

   UserName      Text    50
   Password      Text    64

For a SQL ODBC source:

   Name          Type     Size

   UserName      varchar   50
   Password      varchar   64

To register and configure an ODBC authentication server and Database, perform the
following:

1. On the RADIUS Server, on the Authentication Providers tab, select ODBC
   Authentication, and then click Configure.

2. Enter a description of the authentication database in the Authentication
   database description box, and then click Configure Database.

3. On the Machine Data Source tab, verify that you have already configured a
   data source.

   If you have already configured a data source, locate the data-source name and
   click OK.

   -or-

   If you are creating a new data source, click New and follow the "Create New
   Data Source" Wizard. Select the ODBC table "Network_users_" that you set up
   in the previous steps.

The ODBC data source should be configured as a system Data Source Name (DSN).
Users should now be able to log in through Radius via SQL Server.
