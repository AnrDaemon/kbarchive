MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new ActiveX EXE project. Class1 is created by default.

2. Paste the following code in Class1:

         Type test
            x(5) As Integer
         End Type

3. Add a standard module to the project by selecting "Add Module" from the
   "Project" menu.

4. Paste the following code in Module1:

         Sub main()
            Dim x As test
            x.x(0) = 5
            MsgBox x.x(0)
            Erase x.x
            MsgBox x.x(0)

            Dim y As Variant
            y = x
            y.x(0) = 5
            MsgBox y.x(0)
            Erase y.x         'fails
            MsgBox y.x(0)
         End Sub

5. Open the Immediate Window by selecting it from the View menu.

6. In the Immediate Window, type "main" (without quotes) and press the ENTER
   key. After the message boxes "5","0","5" are displayed, the above error will
   occur on the "Erase y.x" line, instead of emptying the array elements.
