PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0; :8.0,8.01,8.02,8.03

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97, versions 8.0, 8.01, 8.02, 8.03 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Find feature, located on the Tools menu, in the Microsoft
Exchange or Outlook clients, the display name or part of the display name must
be used in the To or From text box. Using alias names will not find items to or
from the user or distribution list.

WORKAROUND
==========

You may use either of the following methods to successfully find items to or
from a particular recipient or distribution list.

 - Choose the display name of the user or distribution list from the Global
   Address Book by selecting the Sent To or From button.

   NOTE: When using Outlook 98, you must select the Advanced button in the Find
   window.

 - Copy the display name of the user from an item and paste it in the To or From
   text box.

NOTE: The alias name cannot be resolved using CTRL+K in any of the Find dialog
boxes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Example 1
---------

Mailbox Display Name = Katherine Smith
Alias Name = Kaths

The following query will not find items from Katherine Smith:

   Find From: Kaths

However, the following query will find items from Katherine Smith because Kath is
a portion of the Display Name:

   Find From: Kath

Example 2
---------

Distribution List Display Name = New York Event Committee
Alias Name = Nyevent

The following query will fail to find items sent to the New York Events Committee
distribution list:

   Find To: Nyevent

However, the following query will find items sent to the New York Event Committee
because Event is a word contained in the Display Name:

   Find To: Event

Similarly, searching on the word, Committee, will also find items sent to the New
York Event Committee, and any other items which contains the word Committee in
the Display Name.


Additional query words: 8.5
