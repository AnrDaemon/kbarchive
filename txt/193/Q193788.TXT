TITLE   :Devices with 64-bit Base Address Registers Do Not Function
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A device that has the capability to access 64-bit base address spaces does not
work in an x86 computer. Some of the newer devices such as fiber channel cards
and high performance SCSI adapters have the capability to use a 64-bit address
space.

CAUSE
=====

Devices that have the capability to support 64-bit base address registers do not
run on x86 computers because x86 computers only support a 32-bit address space.

RESOLUTION
==========

Because of the limitations of hardware, Windows NT can only support the 32-bit
address space. The device will not function properly if installed.

STATUS
======
