MORE INFORMATION
================

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q194699 Extended Log File Format Always in GMT

In Service Pack 4, the behavior was changed so that Log files roll over at
midnight according to the local time zone when metabase property ID 4015 is set
to 1 using MetaEdit (shipped with the IIS Resource Kit) for each concerned Web
site.

You can use the following command to add this metabase key:

   mdutil.exe SET -svc w3svc -i 1 -utype UT_SERVER -dtype DWORD -attrib INHERIT
   -prop 4015 -value 1

Where -svc is the name of the service (for FTP, the service would be MSFTPSVC)
and -i is set to the number of the Web site where you want to set the logging
parameter.
