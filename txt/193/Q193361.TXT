TITLE   :MSGINA.DLL does not Reset WINLOGON Structure
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A previous user's old password is visible to a third-party Gina.dll file because
the Microsoft Msgina.dll file does not reset the old password flag and the old
password string.

CAUSE
=====

When a user changes his or her password because of the "Password Expiration" or
"User Must Change Password During Next Logon" policy during the logon process,
MSGINA keeps a flag indicating that the password has changed and stores the old
password. When the next user logs on, this flag is not reset and the previous
user's old password is stored, even though the new logged on user did not change
his or her password.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition or the individual software
update. For information on obtaining the latest service pack, please go to:
