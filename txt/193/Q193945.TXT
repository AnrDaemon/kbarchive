======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you save a class and give it a filename of a class that already exists, the
following error occurs even if SET SAFETY is OFF:

   A class with that name already exists, overwrite it?

Visual FoxPro provides you the ability to suppress an overwrite screen on forms,
reports, and etc. However, there is not a way to suppress this message when
overwriting a class.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Issue the following commands in the Command window:

         SET SAFETY OFF
         CREATE CLASS mycheck OF myclass AS checkbox

2. Close and save the Class Designer dialog box.

3. Issue the CREATE CLASS command shown in Step 1 in the Command window again.
   Note that a message box appears asking to overwrite the class. The SET SAFETY
   command does not turn off the message box when saving a class.
