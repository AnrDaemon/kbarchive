======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Various performance improvements have been implemented within the SNA Server
client (Snadmod.dll, Snalm.dll) and the Win32 APPC .dll (Wappc32.dll) to help
maximize performance of APPC or CPIC applications. Improvements include:

 - More efficient internal buffer allocation/deallocation within the SNA client
   software.

 - Reduced thread usage when an application calls RECEIVE_ALLOCATE more than
   once and specifies the same TP name.

 - Improved routing of incoming FMH-5 to the SNA client computer where the
   invokable TP is running.

 - Improved SNA Server performance while handling an incoming FMH-5 Attach
   request.


RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has produced an update to SNA Server 4.0 which improves performance
for APPC or CPIC applications. This update is included in the latest SNA Server
