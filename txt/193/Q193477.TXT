TITLE   :FIX: Developer Studio Exits When Creating a Derived Class
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbEditor kbide kbVC600bug kbDevStudio kbGrpDSTools kbNoUpdate

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When creating a derived C++ class, Developer Studio exits with no warning or
error message.

CAUSE
=====

A global variable of that class was declared before the derived C++ class was
defined.

RESOLUTION
==========

Always define the class first before declaring global variables from that class.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++ .NET.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open a C++ project in Developer Studio.

2. In one of the source files, declare the following global variable:

         CDerivedTest g_Test;

3. Position the cursor above this declaration, and begin defining the
   CDerivedTest class as follows:

         class CDerivedTest : public CBaseTest

RESULTS: Before finishing the first line of the class definition, Developer
Studio will exit without warning.

In this example, writing the CDerivedTest class definition first avoids the
problem.
