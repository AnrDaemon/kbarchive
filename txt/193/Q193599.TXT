TITLE   :Windows NT Load Balancing Service Cluster Fails to Converge
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Load Balancing Service 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you start the cluster hosts, the hosts start converging but never report
that convergence has completed.

CAUSE
=====

Either a different number of port rules or incompatible port rules on different
cluster hosts were entered. This will inhibit convergence.

-or-

Two or more Windows NT Load Balancing Service (WLBS) hosts have the same priority
number.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, run the WLBS Setup dialog box on each cluster host
and verify that all hosts have identical port rules and that no two hosts have
the same priority number.

Additional query words: Convoy WLBS
