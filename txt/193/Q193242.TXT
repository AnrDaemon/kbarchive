SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start your Windows-based computer after connecting an
external Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) device, your computer may stop
responding (hang) at the Windows logo screen.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if your computer contains a SCSI adapter with two
internal ports as well as an external port, and there are devices connected to
both of the internal ports. Connecting a device to the external port is not
supported in this configuration.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, disconnect the external SCSI device and then restart
your computer.

For information about how to reconfigure your SCSI devices, please refer to the
documentation included with your computer or the SCSI adapter, or contact the
computer's or adapter's manufacturer.
