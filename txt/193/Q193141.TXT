The first time you play a single-player game of Motocross Madness in the Stunt

usually measured in frames per second) may be reduced during the first minute of

smooth.

This behavior can occur if an nVidea Riva 128-based or 3Dfx Voodoo-based 3-D
accelerator card is installed in your computer.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Motocross Madness,
version 1.0.
