PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Open Subdomain feature in SNA Manager from either a SNA Server
or computer running Windows NT Workstation with the SNA Server Manager
components installed, the first attempt will complete the request, but the next
attempt will fail.

Steps to Reproduce the Problem
------------------------------

1. In SNA Manager, on the File menu, click Open Subdomain.

2. Type in the desired SNA Subdomain using any of the following three possible
   syntaxes: Subdomain, \\<Server_name> or \\<IP_Address>.

3. If the request fails, a series of diagonal lines will be displayed across
   Manager with the following error message also being displayed: <syntax>
   NOT FOUND error message.

4. Close this window and try opening it again using the same syntax as before,
   this time it will work displaying the SNA Subdomain chosen.

CAUSE
=====

This problem was inadvertently introduced as part of an unrelated change
implemented in SNA Server version 3.0 Service Pack 3.
