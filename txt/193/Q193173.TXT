TITLE   :PRB: Silent Setup of PDW Package Cannot Create New Folder
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW) in silent mode, it gives
the following error if the script contains a folder that does not already
exist:

   "Cannot package the project in silent mode because the package folder
   <path to folder> does not exist."

CAUSE
=====

Unlike the interactive PDW, the silent mode works without user intervention. It
is not supposed to create a new folder without approval from the user. To allow
PDW to work silently, the folder must exist and must be empty.

RESOLUTION
==========

To create a new folder as part of batch processing, you can have your batch file
create the folder before performing silent packaging and deployment.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
