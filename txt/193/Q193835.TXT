The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to publish or import a Web, thousands of .tmp files are created on
the server, and the Author.exe or Inetinfo.exe process consumes all available
resources, which will eventually cause the server to stop responding.

CAUSE
=====

Two or more HTML pages include a style sheet reference to each other. This is
caused by using the <BODY STYLESRC="pagename.html"> tag, which references
another page from which to inherit page attributes. Using this method of style
sheets causes an infinite loop when recalculating hyperlinks. For example:

   Page1 includes the following tag in its HTML code:

         <BODY STYLESRC="page2.html">

   Page2 includes the following tag in its HTML code:

         <BODY STYLESRC="page1.html">

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, make sure there are no instances of the <BODY
STYLESRC=""> tag that refer to pages that point back to the referring page.
