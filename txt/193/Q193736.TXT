PROD/VER::Service Release 2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, version Service Release 2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform an Administrative installation of SR-2, the HTML converter no
longer appears as an installed converter when you use the Save As command from
the File menu. This may occur if the following conditions are true:

 - You install the HTML Authoring Tools.

 - You choose to leave shared components on the server.

   -and-

 - You install Internet Explorer 4.01.

CAUSE
=====

When SR-2 is installed, the Internet Explorer 4.01 installation changes the
registry key of the HTML converter to point to the local hard drive but does not
install the HTML converter to the local hard drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow one of these methods:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys and
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

Method 1: Delete the Registry Keys and Run Setup
------------------------------------------------

Delete the registry key and then run Office setup with the /y switch to reinstall
and re-register the converter.

To delete the registry keys, follow these steps:

1. On the Start menu, click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks), and then click
   OK.

3. Locate the following registry key:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Shared Tools\Text
      Converters\Import\HTML

   and

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Shared Tools\Text
      Converters\Export\HTML

4. Click the registry key to highlight it and press the Delete key.

To run Setup with the /y switch, follow these steps:

1. Insert the Word or Office CD into the CD-ROM drive. If you installed Word or
   Office from floppy disks insert the Setup Disk 1 in the floppy disk drive of
   your computer.

2. On the Windows Start menu, click Run.

3. In the Open box, type the following:

   <drive>:\setup /Y

   where <drive> is the letter of the drive that contains the CD or Setup
   Disk 1.

4. Click OK.

5. Click Reinstall.

Method 2: Modify the Registry Key To The Server Installation Path
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Modify the above key to correctly reflect the server installation path of your
shared components. To Modify the path, follow these steps:

1. On the Start menu, click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks), and then click
   OK.

3. Locate the following registry key:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Shared Tools\Text
      Converters\Import\HTML

   Click the HTML registry key and on the right, click Path. From the Edit menu,
   click Modify to change the path.

   and

   Click on the HTML registry key and on the right, click on Path. From the Edit
   menu, click Modify to change the path.

Method 3: Move the Converter To the Location That Is Set In the Registry
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Move the HTML32.cnv file to the location that is set in the registry key.

======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
