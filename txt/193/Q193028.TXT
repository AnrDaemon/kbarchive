SYMPTOMS

2. Double-click Display.

3. Click the Settings tab.

4. Move the Screen Area slider to the right until the screen resolution shown
   underneath the slider is 800 x 600 pixels or higher.

5. Click OK, and then click OK again.

6. When you are prompted to keep the new desktop setting, click Yes.

7. Close Control Panel.
