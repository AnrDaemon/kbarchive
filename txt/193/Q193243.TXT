SUMMARY
=======

This article shows how you can use OLE automation to open the Printer Setup
dialog box in Word 97 for Windows and change the default Windows printer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Word has the ability to open a Printer Setup dialog box that allows
the user to select another printer as the default printer. The following code
demonstrates how to accomplish this task:

      *** Begin code example ***
      oWord=CREATEOBJECT("Word.Application")
      dlg = oWord.Dialogs(97)   && Open printer setup dialog box in Word.
      WITH dlg
         .Show
      ENDWITH
      oWord.Quit
   *** End code example ***

When the code executes, a Printer Setup dialog box appears that contains the
current Windows printers. From this dialog box, you can reset the current
default printer. After choosing the printer, Word briefly appears but then
closes.
