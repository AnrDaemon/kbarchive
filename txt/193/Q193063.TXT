2. On the Insert menu, click Script.

3. In the Language section, click JavaScript.

4. In the Script box, type the following script:

         var version = navigator.appVersion;

         // sets variable = browser version
         if (version.indexOf("MSIE") != -1)
         // checks to see if using IE
            {
            window.location.href="ie.htm"
            /* If using IE, it shows this page
            replace ie.htm with page name */ 
         }else
         window.open("other.htm", target="_self")
         /* else open other page
         replace other.html with page name */ 

5. Click OK.
