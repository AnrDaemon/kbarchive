TITLE   :PRB: Policy to Not Display Last Username on RDP Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When connecting to Terminal Server from an RDP client and the policy "Do not
display last logged on user name" is enabled, the client still displays the
username as if no policy exists. The behavior at the console is as expected.

CAUSE
=====

Built into the RDP client is the functionality to display the username and the
domain to which the client last logged on using the client. This information is
also automatically filled in when connecting to servers that the client has
never connected to before. By doing this, the client only has to enter his or
her password.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The registry location for this policy is

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon
   REG_SZ Value DontDisplayLastUserName

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

A value of 1 indicates that the policy is enabled, and a value of 0 indicates
that it is disabled.
