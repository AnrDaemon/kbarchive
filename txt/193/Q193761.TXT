TITLE   :XFOR: cc:Mail Connector Doesn't Deliver NDRs from Certain ADMDs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When Lotus cc:Mail recipients send incorrectly addressed messages to X.400 users
who are reached through certain X.400 providers, the resulting non- delivery
report (NDR) is not delivered to the cc:Mail recipient.

This occurs in an environment in which Exchange Server and Lotus cc:Mail
messaging and dirsync connectivity has been established through the Exchange
Connector for Lotus cc:Mail, with Exchange acting as an X.400 switch into an
X.400 service provider.

CAUSE
=====

This issue is caused by the Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail not being able
to handle NDRs from Administrative Management Domains (ADMDs) that have no P2
(content). Many providers send the content back with the NDR. The Exchange
Connector for Lotus cc:Mail can correctly deliver the NDRs back to the cc:Mail
originator; however, for those providers that have content return disabled for
NDRs, the resulting NDR is not delivered.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

   File Name   Version
   ----------------------

   Ccmsg.dll   5.5.2358.0

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 2.
