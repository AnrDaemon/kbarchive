TITLE   :BUG: Data Form Wizard Mishandles '-' in Table or Field Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbAddin kbwizard kbVBp kbVBp600bug kbGrpDSVBDB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When loading a form created by the Data Form Wizard, you may receive one of the
following error messages:

   Run-time error '-214217900 (80040e14)', "Syntax error in FROM clause"

   -or-

   Run-time error '-214217904 (80040e10)', "No value given for one or more
   required parameters"

CAUSE
=====

If the data source for a form created by the Data Form Wizard contains a dash
'-' in its name or in the name of a field, it is required that the data source
name or field name be delimited by brackets in a SQL statement. The Data Form
Wizard does not include brackets around these names.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, modify the code created by the Data Form Wizard by
placing brackets around references to any data sources or field names that
contain the '-' character.

Alternatively, data sources and their fields could be renamed to eliminate '-'
characters. This solution could involve more work in general, but may be
acceptable at the beginning stages of application development.

NOTE: You should follow standard Windows naming conventions and not include the
following characters in your database names:

   \ / : * ? < > |

Although some databases such as Access allow forward slashes ("\"), you receive
the above-mentioned error when you use this database through Visual Basic.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a database containing a table so that either the table name includes a
   '-' character or the name of a field in that table contains a '-' character
   (or both).

2. Create a Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created default.

3. From the Add-Ins menu, select the Data Form Wizard command. If this command
   does not appear, load the Data Form Wizard using the Add-In Manager, which
   can be invoked by a corresponding command on the Add-Ins menu. The Data Form
   Wizard command will be added to that menu.

The following instructions refer to the Data Form Wizard:

1. Click the Next button on the first page of the wizard.

2. Select the type of database created in step 1, and click Next.

3. Enter the connection information for the database selected at step 5, and
   click Next.

4. Select ADO Code as the data binding method, and click Next.

5. For the data source, select the table created in step 1, and select all
   fields from the Available Fields list into the Selected Fields list. Click
   Next.

6. Click Finish.

7. Select Project Properties from the Project menu, and then set the Startup
   Object property to refer to the form just created.

8. Run the project. Note that one of the two errors indicated above.

   The workaround is as described above.
