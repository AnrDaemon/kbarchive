TITLE   :FIX: MFC Doesn't Call CPrintDialog::OnInitDialog
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCmnDlg kbVC600bug kbVS600SP1fix kbGrpDSMFCATL

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The OnInitDialog() function (which is called in response to a WM_INITDIALOG
message) for a CPrintDialog-derived class, was called in MFC prior to Visual C++
6.0. However, this is no longer true for MFC DLLs of Visual C++ 6.0. Therefore,
programs that rely on OnInitDialog() to be called will not work as expected.

CAUSE
=====

Previously, MFC set up a message hook for CPrintDialog. This hook was the only
way to catch a WM_INITDIALOG message. MFC for Visual C++ 6.0 purposely removed
this hook so MFC applications would automatically get the new Print dialog by
default on Windows 2000; however, this causes applications that rely on
CPringDialog::OnInitDialog() to fail to work.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set up the message hook function, _AfxCommDlgProc(), in the constructor of your
CPrintDialog-derived class as shown below:

      // CMyPrintDialog is a CPrintDialog-derived class.
      CMyPrintDialog::CMyPrintDialog(DWORD dwFlags)
      : CPrintDialog(FALSE,dwFlags)
      {
         //{{AFX_DATA_INIT(CMyPrintDialog)
         //}}AFX_DATA_INIT
         // MFCBUG: MFC 6.0 doesn't set the message hook!
         m_pd.Flags |= PD_ENABLEPRINTHOOK | PD_ENABLESETUPHOOK;
         // _AfxCommDlgProc is exported from static MFC libraries
         m_pd.lpfnPrintHook = _AfxCommDlgProc;
         m_pd.lpfnSetupHook = _AfxCommDlgProc;
      }

Then, make your project statically linked to MFC.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in the Visual Studio 6.0
Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Derive a class from CPrintDialog.

2. Add a message handler for WM_INITDIALOG in the CPrintDialog-derived class.
   The message handler OnInitDialog() is not called in Visual C++ 6.0.
