OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Memory leaks in the HP SCSIINFO Agent, the HPLER agent, or the HP NIC agent may
be observed on Hewlett Packard computers that have HP TopTools for Servers
version 3.11. Side effects of these memory leaks may include "Out of Virtual
Memory" messages or the complete system may stop responding (hang) when memory
is totally exhausted.

Performance Monitor logs indicate that Private Bytes and Virtual Bytes for these
processes are increasing linearly with time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some versions of HP TopTools have memory leaks. Version 3.2 of the HP NT Agents
should fix the problem and be available on the Hewlett Packard Web site in
September 98.

The third-party products discussed here are manufactured by vendors independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
