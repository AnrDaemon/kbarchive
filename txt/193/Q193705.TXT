SYMPTOMS
========

After you configure your Windows 95-based computer to use more than ten Musical
Instrument Device Interface (MIDI) ports, your computer may stop responding
(hang), or you may receive the following error message:

   Msgsrv32.exe This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut
   down.

If you then click Details, you may receive the following error message:

   MSGSRV32 caused invalid page fault in module KERNEL32.DLL

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because Windows 95 does not support using more than 10 MIDI
ports.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, configure your computer to use 10 MIDI ports or less. For
information about how to do so, view the documentation included with your MIDI
device.

Note that you can use more than 10 MIDI ports in Microsoft Windows 98.
