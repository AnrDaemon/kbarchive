-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Page 272 of the Windows SDK (Software Development Kit) version 3.1 "Programmer's
Reference, Volume 3: Messages, Structures, and Macros" contains an error. The
fAckReq field of the DDEDATA structure describes what should be the fResponse
field, and vice versa.

In addition, the DDEDATA structure documented on page 15-11 of the Windows SDK
version 3.0 "Reference, Volume 2" incorrectly describes what should be the
fResponse field, as fRequested.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows SDK versions 3.0 and the 3.1 both define the DDEDATA structure in
DDE.H as follows:

        typedef struct tagDDEDATA
        {
            WORD  unused: 12,
                             fResponse:1,
                             fRelease:1,
                             reserved:1,
                             fAckReq:1;
            int            cfFormat;
            BYTE     value[1];
        } DDEDATA;

The WM_DDE_DATA documentation for Windows SDK versions 3.0 and 3.1 correctly
describes the structure's fAckReq field. fAckReq is a flag to indicate whether
the server application expects to be acknowledged by the client application
(with a WM_DDE_ACK) when data is received.

The fResponse field, on the other hand, is just a means to distinguish whether
the WM_DDE_DATA message the client received was sent in response to a
WM_DDE_REQUEST (if it is, it is set to TRUE) or WM_DDE_ADVISE (in which case it
is set to FALSE).
