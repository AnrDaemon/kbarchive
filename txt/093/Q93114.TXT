SUMMARY
=======

Page 987 of the Windows SDK "Programmer's Reference, Volume 2: Functions" manual
incorrectly describes the HELP_PARTIALKEY command for the WinHelp API as:

   Displays the topic found in the keyword list that matches the keyword passed
   in the dwData parameter if there is one exact match. If there is more than
   one match, displays the Search dialog box with the topics found listed in the
   Go To list box.

This statement is not correct.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the HELP_PARTIALKEY command is specified when calling the WinHelp API and
more than one match exists, or if there is one exact match for the keyword but
the keyword is defined for more than one topic, then the search dialog box is
displayed. The Go To list box found in the Search dialog box does not display
the topics as the documentation states.

The first keyword that matches the dwData parameter is selected in the keyword
combo box. If the keyword is an exact match, then the user should choose the
Show Topics button to display the topics in the Go To list box. If there are
multiple matches, then the user should decide which keyword is correct, select
that keyword, and choose Show Topics in order to fill up the Go To list box.

For example, if a Help file contains the following keywords

   Rectangle
   Stack
   Stand
   Start
   Stop
   Triangle

and WinHelp is called using the HELP_PARTIALKEY command, with dwData pointing to
a string containing "st", the Search dialog box will be displayed with the
keyword "Stack" selected in the keyword combo box. The user must determine which
of the keywords beginning with "st" is correct, select that keyword, and choose
the Show Topics button, which causes the Go To list box to be filled.

In this same example, if Stack is passed as a keyword, there is one exact match.
If only one topic has Stack for a keyword, then that topic will be displayed in
the Help engine. If multiple topics have Stack as a keyword, then the Search
dialog box will be displayed with Stack selected in the keyword combo box, but
the Go To list box will remain empty until the user chooses the Show Topics
button. When this button is chosen, the Go To list box will be filled with the
titles of the topics marked with the keyword Stack.
