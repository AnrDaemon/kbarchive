KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After upgrading to Microsoft Windows for Workgroups (WFWG) version 3.1 from
Microsoft Windows version 3.0 or 3.1 with Intel Faxability installed, the
following error message occurs when you try to run Windows for Workgroups in
enhanced mode:

   A device has been specified more than once in the SYSTEM.INI file or a device
   specified in SYSTEM.INI conflicts with a device that is being loaded by an
   MS-DOS device driver or application. Remove the duplicate entry from the
   SYSTEM.INI file and restart Windows.

CAUSE
=====

Both Intel Faxability for Windows and Windows for Workgroups install a virtual
communications driver (VxD). When Windows for Workgroups upgrades, it places a
second VxD in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file. Even though these
drivers have different filenames, Windows for Workgroups sees them as duplicates
because they are both virtual communications drivers.

Intel Faxability originally adds:

      DEVICE=CAS31VCD.386

Windows for Workgroups upgrade then adds:

      DEVICE=VCD.386

WORKAROUND
==========

The following procedure eliminates the above error message:

1. Edit the SYSTEM.INI file with any text editor (such as Notepad).

2. Locate the [386Enh] section and find the following lines:

         DEVICE=CAS31VCD.386
         DEVICE=VCD.386

3. To enable the default Windows for Workgroups driver, insert a semicolon (;)
   at the beginning of the DEVICE=CAS31VCD.386 line, as follows:

         ;DEVICE=CAS31VCD.386
