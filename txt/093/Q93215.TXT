SUMMARY
=======

When you double-click an item in a directory list box control, it opens the
directory and displays its subdirectories.

The directory list box control ignores the Enter key by default. To cause a
directory list box to treat the Enter key the same way as a double-click, set
the Path property to List(ListIndex) from within the KeyPress event handler.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code shows how to cause a directory list box to open the selected
directory when the user presses the ENTER key. This code causes a Change event,
just as when you double-click an item.

      Sub Dir1_KeyPress (KeyAscii As Integer)
         If KeyAscii = 13 Then
            Dir1.Path = Dir1.List(Dir1.ListIndex)
         End If
      End Sub

If your form contains a command button with the Default property set to True,
pressing the ENTER key clicks the command button instead of firing the KeyPress
event. In this case, set the Path property to List(ListIndex) from within the
button Click event handler. For example:

      Sub Command1_Click ()
         Dir1.Path = Dir1.List(Dir1.ListIndex)
      End Sub
