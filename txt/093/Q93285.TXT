KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may encounter the following error message when you start Microsoft Windows
in standard mode or during the graphical portion of the Setup procedure:

   The ATI FlexDesk drivers require Windows to be running in 386 Enhanced Mode.

CAUSE
=====

The ATI Windows display drivers for the Mach32 series of video cards (Graphics
Ultra Plus and Graphics Ultra Pro) require that Windows 3.1 or Windows for
Workgroups 3.1 be running in 386 enhanced mode. This can cause problems if you
run the Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.1 Setup programs to upgrade or
reinstall, or if you run Windows in standard mode for testing purposes.

WORKAROUND
==========

Change the display driver to VGA or 8514/A before running Setup or starting
Windows in standard mode. This also means that you cannot install this driver
when installing Windows for the first time or to a new directory.

================
