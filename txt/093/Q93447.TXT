======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft C/C++ for MS-DOS 
 - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, 16-bit edition, versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.51 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When compiling a C++ program that uses the TRY and CATCH macros to implement
exception handling, the compilation fails with the following error message:

   error C2060: syntax error : end-of-file found

With Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, the following error is generated:

   fatal error C1004: unexpected end of file found

CAUSE
=====

A CATCH (or AND_CATCH) block is not closed with the END_CATCH macro. The CATCH
macro creates a code block that is to be terminated by the END_CATCH macro.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the program code to add the END_CATCH macro to the exception handling
code.
