KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You can start the real mode redirector before Windows for Workgroups by typing
any of the following at the MS-DOS command prompt:

   net start workstation
   net start full
   net start basic

After starting Windows for Workgroups, you cannot connect to or enable your own
shared resources. If you then disable the real mode redirector by typing "net
stop" (without the quotation marks) at an MS-DOS command prompt, you can enable
resource sharing. However, you still cannot connect to other computers on your
Windows for Workgroups network. If you try, the following error message is
displayed:

   The Windows for Workgroups network cannot be started. Run the Setup program
   again to correctly configure Windows for Workgroups.

CAUSE
=====

If you load the real mode redirector before starting Windows for Workgroups, the
protect mode redirector, VREDIR.386, does not start. However, VSERVER.386, the
resource sharing driver, does load. This is why, after stopping the real mode
redirector, some network services are available.

WORKAROUND
==========

To enable all network services, you must exit Windows for Workgroups, make sure
the real mode redirector is stopped, and then restart Windowsfor Workgroups.
