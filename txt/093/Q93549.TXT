MORE INFORMATION

Installation of the Pro Audio Spectrum 16 Windows drivers causes the following
changes:

Changes to the SYSTEM.INI file:

      CDAudio=mcicda.drv

      audio=mvproaud.drv,0,0,0

      [mvproaud.drv]
      dma=3
      irq=7

The settings for the DMA channel (3) and interrupt (7) are the factory defaults.
Valid settings for the DMA channel are 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7. Valid settings
for the interrupt are 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, and 15. The Pro Audio Spectrum 16
includes a Sound Blaster compatibility mode which is automatically set to DMA
channel 1, interrupt 5, and I/O port address 220. In most cases, DMA channel 1
can be shared with the Sound Blaster compatibility mode, but it is not possible
to share the same interrupt setting.
