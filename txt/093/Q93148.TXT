======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Panasonic KX-P4420 laser printer with a third-party memory board,
you may experience problems printing large print jobs from Microsoft Windows
version 3.1.

Microsoft Word for Windows, Aldus PageMaker, and Microsoft Windows Write may be
unable to print more than five pages, and graphics may be printed partially or
not at all.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may be caused by an incorrect jumper setting on a third-party
memory expansion board installed on the printer. In this case, there is no
indication of an error from the printer, and the printer memory appears to be
used normally by the Windows printer driver. However, the printer cannot
actually use the memory, and large print jobs cause the printer to jam.

WORKAROUND
==========

Remove the memory board from the printer. This should allow the large documents
to print normally. This may also help determine if the memory board is the
source of the problem.

For instructions on removing the memory board, contact your memory board
manufacturer.
