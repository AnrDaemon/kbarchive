SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses using OnTrack's Disk Manager version 5.1 with Microsoft
Windows version 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Compatibility with SmartDrive version 4.0
-----------------------------------------

According to OnTrack Technical Support, Disk Manager version 5.1 is compatible
with SmartDrive version 4.0, although there may be some problems using it with
SmartDrive's Double_Buffer command, depending upon your hardware configuration:

 - System with no SCSI adapter

   OnTrack recommends removing the

   DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE
      /DOUBLE_BUFFER

   line in the CONFIG.SYS on all systems that do not have a SCSI host adapter.

 - System with a SCSI adapter, but no drives with more than 1024 cylinders

   OnTrack recommends adding the line

   DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE
      /DOUBLE_BUFFER+

   in order to support partitions larger than 32 MB with MS- DOS versions 3.3 and
   earlier. If the plus sign is omitted, SmartDrive will fail.

 - System with a SCSI adapter and drives with more than 1024 cylinders

   OnTrack recommends removing the SmartDrive DEVICE= statement (even if it is
   using the Double_Buffer command) in the CONFIG.SYS file on all systems with a
   SCSI adapter and drives with more than 1024 cylinders. It should be noted
   that with this configuration Windows will not run in 386 enhanced mode.

Compatibility with Windows 3.1 Swap Files
-----------------------------------------

According to OnTrack, Disk Manager 5.1 is compatible with Windows 3.1 swap files
but you may be prevented from creating a permanent swap file in the following
situations:

 - Head or sector-per-track mismatch (unless IDE)

   If the number of heads and sectors per track specified by your CMOS drive type
   entry does not match the actual number of heads and sectors per track of your
   drive, your configuration prevents the use of a permanent swap file.
   Resolving this conflict requires that you reinstall your drive and will
   likely result in lost disk space. If you must use a permanent swap file,
   OnTrack Technical Support can provide suggestions on reconfiguring your
   system to allow it.

 - Large partitions with MS-DOS version 3.3 and earlier

   If you are using MS-DOS 3.3 or earlier and have a partition larger than 32 MB,
   you cannot use a permanent swap file. To use a permanent swap file with your
   system, you must either upgrade to MS-DOS 4.0 or later and reinstall your
   system or make all partitions 32 MB or less and reinstall with your current
   version of MS-DOS.

 - Drives with more than 1024 cylinders

   Permanent swap files can be accessed by Windows only if they are created
   within the first 1024 cylinders of your drive. Make sure you create your swap
   file on a partition that contains 1024 cylinders or less. Otherwise, Windows
   will issue a corrupt swap file error when started. If you have a drive with
   more than 1024 cylinders, you need to manually enable permanent swap file
   support by modifying the DMDRVR device statement in your CONFIG.SYS file to
   include a /P option as shown below:

   device=c:\dmdrvr.bin /p

If you have problems with corrupt swap file errors when using the /P option, it
is likely that your drive partition is not located within the first 1024
cylinders.
