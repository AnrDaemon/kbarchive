SUMMARY
=======

FoxPro creates backup files prior to performing certain operations that can
corrupt the database if the operation fails. The backup file is created in the
same directory as the original file and has the .BAK extension.

FoxPro creates a backup file before performing any of the following operations:

   APPEND FROM
   MODIFY STRUCTURE
   PACK
   UPDATE ON

If the database has an associated memo file, the backup copy of the memo file has
the .TBK extension.

The PACK command deletes the backup file once the operation has been completed
successfully.

To restore information from a backup file, delete or rename the .DBF file with
the same name, then rename the backup file so that is has the .DBF file
extension. The .BAK file may also be used as a database if the user specifies
the complete filename (including the extension) in the USE command.
