TITLE   :ERR: "Incorrect Results" When Using SET EXACT in FoxBASE+/Mac
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fox Miscellaneous Products
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.01
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for Macintosh, version 2.01 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When SET EXACT is set to ON, checking memory variables that contain different
numbers of spaces does not produce the expected results.

CAUSE
=====

The error occurs because the SET EXACT ON command removes the spaces from each
memory variable before they are compared.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following code displays the message

   Incorrect results.

However, if the first line of code is changed to SET EXACT OFF, the code displays
"Correct results."

      SET EXACT ON
      var1 = " "    && 1 space
      var2 = "   "  && 3 spaces
      IF var1 = var2
        WAIT "Incorrect results"
      ELSE
        WAIT "Correct results"
      ENDIF
