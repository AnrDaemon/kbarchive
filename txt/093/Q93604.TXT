SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT supports ISO 9660 CD-ROM format, but does not support any of the
RockRidge CD-ROM format extensions. ISO 9660 is an international standard that
defines a file system for compact discs. Almost all systems support ISO 9660.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Level one ISO 9660 is similar to the MS-DOS file system. Filenames are limited
to eight single-case characters, a period, and a three-character extension.
Filenames cannot contain special or extended characters, (no hyphens, tildes,
equal or plus signs), only single-case letters, numbers, and underscores.
Directory names cannot contain three-digit extensions, just eight single-case
characters.

All alphabetic characters are in uppercase letters; some software maps these to
lowercase letters. Either the filename or the extension may be empty, but not
both ("F." and ".E" are both legal filenames).

There is a "file version number" that can range from 1 to 32,767 and is separated
from the extension by a semicolon. The file version number is ignored on many
systems.

Subdirectories are allowed to nest up to eight levels deep.

Level two ISO 9660 allows longer filenames, up to 32 characters; however, most of
the other restrictions still apply. Level two discs cannot be used on some
systems, such as MS-DOS.

Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 supports Level 3 and allows for for Fragmented
files which is needed to support finalised Packet written disk. CDFS also
support Joliet extensions which allows for longer files names and unicode
names.

Rock Ridge is not supported in Windows NT or Windows 2000.
