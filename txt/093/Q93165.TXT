TITLE   :Intel EtherExpress Card Conflicts with Scanning Hardware
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You install Windows for Workgroups, and your graphics scanning device doesn't
work.

CAUSE
=====

The base I/O port address for many graphics scanning devices is 300. Because
this is also the default I/O port address for the Intel EtherExpress card that
is included with the Windows for Workgroups Starter Kit, many graphics scanning
devices don't work with Windows for Workgroups until you change the port address
on one of the cards.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the base I/O port address on either the
graphics scanning device or the EtherExpress card.

To change the port for the EtherExpress card:

1. Run Control Panel and choose the Network icon.

2. Choose the Adapters button.

3. Select the EtherExpress card from the Network Adapters In Use list.

4. Choose the Setup button.

5. Change the Base I/O Port address to an address that does not conflict with
   your graphics scanning device (or any other hardware devices) in your system.
