TITLE   :Setting up WfW with TCP Manually: Resource Kit Manual Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

On page E-5 of the Microsoft Windows for Workgroups "Resource Kit" version 3.1
manual, the device driver name in the [ms$tcp] section of the PROTOCOL.INI file
is incorrectly shown in lowercase letters:

   [ms$tcp]
   drivername=TCPIP$ (not tcpip$ as shown in the guide)

SYMPTOMS
========

If the drivername is lowercase, TCPDRV.DOS fails to initialize in the CONFIG.SYS
file, and this error message is displayed:

   DOS TCP/IP Resident Driver Initialzation failed

(with "initialization" misspelled as shown).

CAUSE
=====

Initialization fails because the drivername contains lowercase letters.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use uppercase letters for the drivername.

LAN Manager 2.2 includes a protocol disk in Windows for Workgroups format, so you
can ignore the NDIS transport protocol integration procedure described in the
"Resource Kit."

REFERENCES
==========
