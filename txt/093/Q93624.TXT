To activate the colors of a screen, issue a CLEAR command on the line
following the SCREEN definition. Doing so erases the screen and releases
all pending GET statements to allow the new color to be "painted" on the
screen. For example:

      STORE "My Name" TO x

      SCREEN 1 COLOR 0,0,0,-8552,-30998,-1 TOP
      CLEAR
      @ PIXELS 72,83 GET x COLOR 0,0,0,-1,-1,-1
      READ

Additional query words: 2.01 plus colour FoxBASE+/Mac
