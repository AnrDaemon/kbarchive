SUMMARY
=======

The Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet IIISi printer driver version 2.0 that comes
with Windows 3.1 provides the option to print in duplex. However, the HP
LaserJet IIISi printer may or may not have the duplex option installed.

To determine if your printer has the duplex option installed, run the 05 Self
Test on your printer and see the Installed Options line.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To print the 05 Self Test, press and hold down the Print Fonts/Test key on your
printer control panel until you see 05 SELF TEST on the LCD. For more
information, see page 4-8 of your "LaserJet IIISi Printer User's Reference
Manual."

To check for the duplex option on the printed report, look at the Installed
Options line. DUPLEX UNIT must be listed on the Installed Options line to print
duplex. For more information, see page 4-57, Figure 4-10 in your "LaserJet IIISi
Printer User's Reference Manual."

To configure the printer driver for duplex printing, do the following:

1. Choose the Printers icon from Control Panel.

2. Choose the Setup button.

3. Choose the Options button.

4. Select one of the two duplex printing options: Long Edge or Short Edge
