TITLE   :PC Adm: Deleting Users Does Not Delete Users from Groups
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Deleting a local user from a postoffice in version 3.0 or 3.0a of Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks does not remove the user's name from any group listings.

CAUSE
=====

The Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) does not search through all groups to
delete a user's name.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can leave the user's name in group lists--Mail will not send mail to an
invalid user name. If you want to remove the name anyway, edit the group list by
selecting Groups from the Local-Admin menu in ADMIN.EXE.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0 and 3.0a of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. This problem was corrected in version 3.2.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.00a 3.20 Admin
