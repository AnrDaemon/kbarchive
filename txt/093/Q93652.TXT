TITLE   :WFWG Err Msg with DblSpace: PRO0003E: PROTOCOL.INI File Open
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.22; WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

If Windows for Workgroups is installed on a DoubleSpace-compressed drive, you
may receive one of the following error messages or the system may stop
responding ("hang") when the network drivers are loading:

 - PRO0003E: PROTOCOL.INI file open failure

 - Unable to open Protocol Manager

 - Error 3653: The protocol manager could not be found

CAUSE
=====

These errors occurs because Windows for Workgroups cannot find the path to the
PROTOCOL.INI file in memory.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, make sure that the DEVICEHIGH command for
DoubleSpace is located before the DEVICE command for PROTMAN.DOS in the
CONFIG.SYS file. For example:

      devicehigh=c:\dos\dblspace.sys /move
      device=c:\windows\protman.dos /i:c:\windows

Additional query words: 6.00 6.20 3.10 wfw wfwg dblspace
