======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to add a user by using the Admin utility (ADMIN.EXE) in
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.0, you may see the following error
message:

   Error creating mailbox

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Mail may not be able to create the mailbox because there are not
enough available directory entries in the Novell NetWare operating system.
NetWare reserves a specific number of directory entries on the volume based on
the volume size. NetWare defines directory entries as files, subdirectories, and
trustee assignments. If there are not enough available entries, Mail cannot add
the new user.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can check to see how many directory entries are available on a NetWare
volume by running the VOLINFO NetWare utility. To do this, type VOLINFO at any
NetWare drive prompt.

If there are not enough free directory entries, add more disk space to the
NetWare volume or delete files, subdirectories, and trustee assignments.
