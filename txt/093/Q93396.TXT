TITLE   :DOCERR: PrependToPath Documented Incorrectly

SUMMARY
=======

The PrependToPath subroutine from the Setup toolkit is incorrectly documented in
the Setup toolkit's README.WRI file. The arguments to the subroutine should not
be enclosed in parentheses. PrependToPath is a subroutine and, unlike functions,
the arguments to subroutines are never put in parentheses.

The syntax of the PrependToPath call is:

      PrependToPath szSrc$, szDest$, szDir$, cmo%

An example of a call to PrependToPath is:

      PrependToPath "c:\autoexec.bat","c:\autoexec.new","c:\tmp",cmoVital

szSrc$ is the full path of the original file. szDest$ is the name of new file
created, which has the contents of the szSrc$ file with szDir$ added to the PATH
statements. szSrc$ and szDest$ should not be the same. You can use the Setup
function RenameFile to rename the original AUTOEXEC.BAT to a backup filename,
and then again to rename the new file (AUTOEXEC.NEW in the code above) to
AUTOEXEC.BAT.
