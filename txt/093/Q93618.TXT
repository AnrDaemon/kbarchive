The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for Macintosh, version 2.01 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To use a FoxBASE+/Mac database file in Microsoft Excel 4.0 for the Macintosh,
place the database file in the Excel Startup Folder. When Microsoft Excel
starts, it automatically opens the database file.

CAUTION: If the database file has a memo field, Microsoft Excel cannot open the
memo file. If you use Microsoft Excel to modify the contents of a database file
that has a memo field, and then open the file in FoxBASE+, the memo field will
be changed to a character field. Even if the field is changed back to a memo
field, you cannot access the memo file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On a machine running Apple System 6, the Excel Startup Folder is in the System
Folder. On a machine running Apple System 7, the Excel Startup Folder is in the
Preferences Folder in the System Folder.
