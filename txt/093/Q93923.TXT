TITLE   :Error Using LOADHIGH (LH) With Third-Party Shell

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


If you use the new MS-DOS 6.0 and later LOADHIGH (LH) parameters (/L or /S) with
a third-party command interpreter (sometimes called a shell), such as NDOS or
4DOS, you receive the following error message:

   Error: Unknown Command "/l:<region1>;<region2>"

CAUSE
=====

MS-DOS 6.0 and 6.2 COMMAND.COM supports two memory specific parameters: /L and
/S, which are determined by MemMaker. For example, "LOADHIGH /L:0;1 MOUSE.COM"
is a valid command in MS-DOS 6.0 and 6.2.

Third-party command interpreters such as 4DOS and NDOS are designed to replace
COMMAND.COM. These command interpreters have to be updated to work correctly
with the new /L and /S parameters.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem, either use COMMAND.COM for your command interpreter
or remove the /L and /S parameters from your LOADHIGH (LH) commands.

For more information or to obtain an update to your third-party command
interpreters, please contact your command interpreter vendor.

The 4DOS and NDOS products included here are manufactured by vendors independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
