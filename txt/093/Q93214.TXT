The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

On Page 126 of the Visual Basic Programmer's Guide, it incorrectly states that
all controls have an implicit property you can use for storing or retrieving
values. Some controls supplied with the Professional Edition of Visual Basic for
Windows use the Name property as their implicit property, which you cannot use
at run-time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following controls from the Visual Basic Professional Edition use the Name
property as their implicit property:

   Common dialog
   MAPI session
   MAPI message
   Spin button

Attempting to access the implicit property of these controls results in one of
the following errors:

   'Name' property cannot be read at run time
   'Name' property cannot be set at run time

You access the implicit property of a control (also known as the "value of a
control" or the "default value of a control") by writing the control name with
no property. For example, with a text box named Text1, you can write the
following statement to assign a value to the Text property:

      Text1 = "hello world"

The following list shows the implicit properties for all the controls in both the
Standard and Professional Editions:
