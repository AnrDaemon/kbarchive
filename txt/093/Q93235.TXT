======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Printing TrueType fonts on the C. Itoh CI-4, or Kodak Ekta Plus 7008 printer in
landscape orientation while emulating the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet IIP
results in incorrect output. Portrait orientation is not affected and TrueType
fonts print correctly.

CAUSE
=====

There is no specific driver available for this printer from either Microsoft or
Kodak. According to Kodak technical support, the problem occurs when the printer
is using the primary emulation of the HP LaserJet IIP. It does not occur when
using the HP LaserJet Series II driver supplied with Windows 3.1.

WORKAROUND
==========

Kodak recommends two workarounds: using the HP LaserJet Series II driver, or
selecting Print TrueType As Graphics.

Selecting Print TrueType As Graphics
------------------------------------

1. Run the Control Panel.

2. Choose the Printers icon.

3. Select the HP LaserJet IIP.

4. Choose the Setup button.

5. Choose the Options button.

6. Select the Print TrueType As Graphics check box.
