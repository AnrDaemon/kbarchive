TITLE   :DOCERR: CITATION .HPJ Statement Incorrectly Documented
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The CITATION Help project file (HPJ) option is missing from the Windows version
3.1 SDK "Programming Tools" manual and is incorrectly documented in the online
help file, WIN31WH.HLP. The following description, from the Help Authoring Guide
on the MSDN CD, is correct:

   CITATION Option

   Syntax

   CITATION=copyright-notice

   The CITATION option appends a custom copyright notice to the end of any
   information that is copied from the Help file using the Copy command. You can
   use this option if a publisher owns some material in your Help file and
   requires that you attach a copyright notice to that material.

   Parameter

   copyright-notice

   Specifies the copyright information you want to append to copied material. The
   notice appears at the end of text displayed in the Copy dialog box (the
   notice is appended whenever the user copies text from the original Help
   file).

   Comments

   The CITATION option differs from the COPYRIGHT option in two ways: a citation
   does not appear in the About dialog box, and a citation can be much larger
   than the standard copyright notice. The maximum size of the citation
   copyright notice is about 2K (compared to 50 characters for COPYRIGHT).

   Example

   The following shows a sample citation:

   CITATION=Information in this document is subject to change without notice and
   does not represent a commitment on the part of Microsoft Corporation. The
   software, which includes information contained in any databases, described in
   this document is furnished under a license agreement or nondisclosure

   may be reproduced in any form or by any means, electronic or mechanical, for

MORE INFORMATION
================

To put a notice in the About box, use the COPYRIGHT option rather than the
CITATION option.
