KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The External Mail program for versions 2.1 and 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks tries repeatedly to deliver mail to a postoffice with insufficient disk
space for the message. External keeps trying, and fails to deliver other
outgoing mail.

CAUSE
=====

When the External Mail program attempts to send a message or attachment that is
too large for the target postoffice's disk, the target postoffice sends the
following error message:

   Drive Error

External retries without logging an error in the SESSION.LOG file, and the
process continues in an endless loop, keeping External too busy to send other
mail waiting in the queue.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 2.1, 3.0, and 3.0a of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. This problem was corrected in version 3.2.

Additional query words: 2.10 3.00 3.00a MTA
