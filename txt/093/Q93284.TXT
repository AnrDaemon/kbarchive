TITLE   :WFWG Err Msg: Error 12: The Access Code Is Invalid
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you type "NET VIEW" (without the quotation marks) before the workstation
services have been started, the redirector is started, the user is logged on,
and then the following error message is displayed:

   Error 12: The Access code is invalid.

   The NET VIEW command is not carried out.

STATUS
======

This problem does not occur in later version of Windows for Workgroups.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows for Workgroups starts the default redirector at MS-DOS if any NET.EXE
command is entered (with the exceptions of NET STOP and NET LOGOFF). Windows for
Workgroups prompts the user for a logon name and password and then performs the
requested function. For example, typing "NET USE x: \\SERVER\SHARE" (without the
quotation marks) starts the workstation services, performs a logon for the user,
and makes the requested connection.


Additional query words: 3.10 redir service
