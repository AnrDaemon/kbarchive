TITLE   :FIX: /Z Switch Gives "Unknown Option" Error in MASM 6.0b
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 6.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the MASM compatibility driver provided with version 6.0b of the Microsoft
Macro Assembler is called with the /Z command line switch, the following error
occurs:

   Unknown option: z. Use /help for list of options

RESOLUTION
==========

Omit the /Z switch from the command line. The /Z switch has no effect.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 6.0b. This problem
was corrected in MASM for MS-DOS version 6.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ML driver invokes the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) versions 6.x. MASM
includes the MASM.EXE compatibility driver for backward compatibility with
makefiles written for the MASM driver used in versions 5.x and earlier.

In MASM versions 5.x, the /Z switch displays on the screen the source file lines
that contain errors. In MASM versions 6.0 and 6.0a, the /Z option is correctly
ignored. However, in version 6.0b, MASM generates an error in response to this
option switch and does not assemble the file.
