TITLE   :BUG: Memory Use Greater With DPMI Memory Than VCPI or XMS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER::4.0,4.01,4.05,4.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly kbCodeView kbDebug kbVCkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for MS-DOS, versions 4.0, 4.01, 4.05, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the memory manager provides DPMI memory, the CodeView debugger is unable to
load a very large MS-DOS application. However, CodeView can load the application
when the memory manager provides VCPI or XMS memory to CodeView.

CAUSE
=====

CodeView requires more than 64K conventional MS-DOS memory (addressed below
640K) when it runs with a DPMI memory manager and only 17K when it runs with a
VCPI or XMS memory manager.

RESOLUTION
==========

If insufficient conventional memory is available when the system is configured
for DPMI memory, change the system configuration to provide VCPI or XMS memory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft CodeView versions 4.0,
4.01, 4.05, and 4.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 4.00
