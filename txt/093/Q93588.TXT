-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you import an encapsulated PostScript (EPS) graphic into Microsoft PowerPoint
for Windows, it may display as a frame, not as a picture. This frame may contain
only the name of the file and the name of the application that created it. This
graphic prints correctly to a PostScript printer. If printed to any other type
of printer, it prints the same as it appears on the screen.

CAUSE
=====

This happens if the EPS file does not contain a screen representation of the
image in the file header. If the file does contain this preview, PowerPoint
displays a representation of the actual graphic rather than a frame. It is up to
the application that created the EPS file to provide the image preview.

MORE INFORMATION
================

According to the EPS File Format published by Adobe Systems, EPS files should
contain a "graphic representation" so that they "can be manipulated and
displayed on a workstation's screen prior to printing." This representation is
usually a low resolution black-and-white TIFF graphic, although it can, in
theory, be a Windows Metafile. Some programs omit this preview to reduce the
file size of the image. Others omit the preview because it is more difficult to
create an EPS image with a preview than one without.

Most EPS files sold as clip art by commercial vendors have an image header. These
images appear in PowerPoint and other applications.

EPS files created by using the Print To EPS File option in the Windows PostScript
printer driver do not contain an image header. These appear in PowerPoint and
other applications as a frame.

Illustration programs such as CorelDRAW and Micrografx Designer enable you to
create EPS files with or without image headers.

CorelDRAW and Micrografx Designer are manufactured by vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
