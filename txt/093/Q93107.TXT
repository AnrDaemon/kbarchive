SUMMARY
=======

You can print multiple documents with Windows 3.0 File Manager by selecting the
files you want to print and then choosing the Print command from the File
Manager File menu.

Performing these same tasks in Windows 3.1 generates a dialog box listing the
files to be printed. After you choose the OK button, you receive the following
error message:

   File Manager cannot print multiple files.
   Select only one file, and then try again.

This message also occurs when Print Manager is running minimized and you try to
drag and drop multiple files onto the Print Manager icon.


Additional query words: 3.10 3.1 error message winfile
