SUMMARY
=======

To align an output field in the Report Writer, select the desired alignment by
using the Format button, not the Style button.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: In Visual FoxPro for Windows, there is coordination between the Report
Writer's Format button and the Text Alignment command under the Format menu. The
format selected in the Text Alignment command becomes the default selection for
the report's Format button.

In the Report Expression dialog box, choose the Format button. If the field type
is character, Center and Right Align are the available options.

If the field type is numeric, Left Justify is an available option in FoxPro
version for MS-DOS. In FoxPro for Windows, however, the Left Justify option is
disable (dimmed) for numeric field types.

If you choose the Style button in the Report Expression dialog box, the Center,
Left, and Right alignment options are available. However, these options do not
change the alignment for the field unless the output is printed using a
PostScript printer driver. The Style selection is a MS-DOS only option.

To left-justify a field in FoxPro for Windows, choose Text Alignment from the
Object menu, then select Left.
