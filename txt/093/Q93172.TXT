The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1.49 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a system does not have any value assigned to the INIT environment
variable, Programmer's Workbench uses the value of the USER
environment variable to determine where to store the CURRENT.STS file.

For example, the USER environment variable is set with the following
MS-DOS command in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file or at the MS-DOS prompt:

   SET USER=username

If the current directory is C:\TEST and the INIT environment variable
does not exist, PWB attempts to create the CURRENT.STS file in the
C:\TEST\username directory.
