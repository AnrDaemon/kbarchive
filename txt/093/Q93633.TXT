KEYWORDS:kbcode

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS 
 - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for MS-DOS 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In FoxPro 2.x, to create or modify a database under program control, you can use
the COPY TO <name> STRUCTURE EXTENDED, the CREATE <name1> FROM
<name2> command.

In Visual FoxPro, you can use the ALTER TABLE command.

Also, you can use the CREATE TABLE command in any version of FoxPro.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code examples create a new database named TEMP that contains one
field. The field is named LASTNAME and is 30 characters long.

FoxPro 2.x
----------

      USE anyfile
      COPY TO temp STRUCTURE EXTENDED
      USE temp

      APPEND BLANK
      REPLACE field_name WITH 'lastname'
      REPLACE field_len WITH 30
      REPLACE field_type WITH 'C'
      REPLACE field_dec WITH 0
      CREATE newfile FROM temp

NOTE: To add more than one field to the table, perform another APPEND BLANK and
then the REPLACE sequence again.

The COPY STRUCTURE EXTENDED command creates a new database file that describes
the structure of the original database. Each record of the new database
describes a field of the original database.

NOTE: The COPY STRUCTURE EXTENDED and CREATE FROM commands also work in
stand-alone applications created with the FoxPro Distribution Kit.

Visual FoxPro
-------------

      USE anyfile
      ALTER TABLE Temp  ADD COLUMN  "Lastname" C(10)

CREATE TABLE Command
--------------------

You can also use the CREATE TABLE command to modify or create a database. Its
syntax is as follows:

      CREATE table <dbf_name>(<fname1> <type> [(<precision>[,
   <scale>])[,
         <fname2> ...]])

The following example creates a table with the NAME, ADDR, CITY, ZIP, and SALARY
fields, plus a memo field called COMMENTS:

      CREATE Table employee ;
         (name C(20), addr C(30), city C(30), zip C(5), salary N(8,2), ;
            comments M)
