SUMMARY
=======

Joint Data Systems G-Host S3 Local Bus video cards require Video BIOS version
1.8 or later to be fully compatible with Microsoft Windows 3.1. The Video BIOS
should be displayed as the computer is starting up or it can be determined by
choosing Video in the Microsoft Diagnostics Utility (MSD.EXE) included with
Windows 3.1.

To obtain a new Video BIOS, contact the computer dealer from where the computer
was purchased.

MORE INFORMATION
================

BIOS version 1.6 has known problems that conflict with Windows 3.1 and are
corrected with BIOS version 1.8. Joint Data Systems recommends you upgrade to
version 1.9 for full-feature support under Windows and Windows for Workgroups
3.1.

For Video BIOS version 1.8, Joint Data System recommends the S3 display driver
version 1.4. S3 display driver version 1.51 is recommended for use with Video
BIOS version 1.9. The updated S3 display drivers for the G-Host S3 Local Bus
video cards are available from Joint Data Systems.

For more information, call Joint Data Systems technical support.
