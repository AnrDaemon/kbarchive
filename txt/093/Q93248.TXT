======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The NET STOP command is designed to disable the Windows for Workgroups real mode
redirector, which is started by typing the following at the MS-DOS command
prompt:

   net start workstation/full/basic

If you use NET STOP from the Windows for Workgroups MS-DOS command prompt and
have not previously loaded the real mode redirector, the following error message
is displayed:

   Error 2184: The service has not been started.

NET STOP logs you off of the network but does not disable the protect mode
redirector (VREDIR.386). All network options remain available, but you are
prompted to log on if you attempt to use them.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you want to disable the protected mode redirector, exit Windows for
Workgroups.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups version
3.1.
