TITLE   :BUG: QuickHelp Paste Topic Command Pastes Two Extra Lines
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:1.7,1.83
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft QuickHelp for MS-DOS, versions 1.7, 1.83 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After pasting an example program from the Microsoft QuickHelp utility, compiling
the program generates the following errors, possibly among others:

   settime.c(1) : error C2143: syntax error : missing '{'
   before ':'
   settime.c(1) : error C2143: syntax error : missing ';'
   before ':'
   settime.c(81) : error C2143: syntax error : missing ';'
   before '-'

SETTIME.C is the example program to demonstrate the _dos_getdate() function.

CAUSE
=====

These errors are caused by the following two lines which are pasted into the
file with the QuickHelp utility:

   Topic: SETTIME.C

   -and-

   -<>-

The "<>" symbol in the second line is the character 0x04 that indicates the
end of the topic.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the file to comment out or delete the two lines indicated above before
compiling the example program.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in QuickHelp versions 1.7 and 1.83.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
