1. Q. What is the most common reason for unsuccessful installation of Microsoft
   Windows?

   A. Terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs loaded from the CONFIG.SYS and
   AUTOEXEC.BAT files are the most common cause of unsuccessful Windows
   installations. If you are having difficulty with Windows Setup, insert a
   system disk in your floppy disk drive and restart your computer. The system
   disk should contain CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files without any device
   drivers or TSR programs loaded, unless such items are needed to access the
   hard disk drive. If you use any special drivers for your hard disk drive,
   such as Disk Manager or Stacker(TM), make sure the drivers are in your new
   CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files and also on the system disk.

2. Q. When Windows Setup attempts to switch from the MS-DOS-based portion of
   Setup to the Windows-based portion of the installation, the hourglass
   disappears and Setup hangs, or Windows exits to MS-DOS. Why is this
   happening?

   A. Setup may stop responding if a corrupted SETUP.INF or SETUP.EXE file or an
   outdated version of one of these files is located in the WINDOWS or
   WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory. Search for SETUP.INF and SETUP.EXE in these
   directories and rename these files if you find them. (For example, rename
   SETUP.INF to SETUP.OLD.) After you rename the file or files, run the Windows
   Setup program again from the Windows disks.

3. Q. Setup correctly identifies that I have a Video Seven(TM) video card;
   however, when I switch from the MS-DOS-based portion of Setup to the
   Windows-based portion of Setup, my computer hangs. How can I correct this
   problem?

   A. The video drivers that ship with Windows 3.1 support most Video Seven video
   cards, but not those using the Headland Technology Video Seven HT-216 or
   HT-217 chip sets. If your card uses one of these chip sets, select standard
   VGA, rather than Video Seven, during Setup. If you need the additional
   resolution or color drivers for the card, contact Video Seven technical
   support.
