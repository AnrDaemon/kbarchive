======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a syntax error occurs when you try to load SMARTDrive version 4.0, 4.1, 4.2,
or 5.0 from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file or the MS-DOS command line, SMARTDrive does
not load. Instead of displaying an error message, SMARTDrive displays the online
help screen. This screen contains the same information that is displayed if you
type "SMARTDRV /?" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt.

Similarly, if the /C or /Q switches are used on the command line to load
SMARTDrive from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, SMARTDrive does not load, but it also
does not display any information, even if /V (Verbose) switch is used.

CAUSE
=====

Any syntax errors that appear on the command line used to load SMARTDrive
generate these problems. For example, if you try to enable write-behind caching
for drive C by typing "+C" (instead of "C+") at the end of the SMARTDRV.EXE
command line, SMARTDrive does not load, and the online help information is
displayed (even if you specified a /Q switch, which normally prevents the
display of SMARTDrive information on the screen).

In addition, the following command line switches prevent SMARTDrive from
loading:

   Command Line Option              Purpose
   -------------------              -------

   /C                               Writes all cached information to
                                    the hard disk.

   /S                               Displays additional information about
                                    the status of SMARTDrive.

   /?                               Displays online help about SMARTDrive.

These options are not designed to be used on the command line when you start
SMARTDrive.
