TITLE   :PRB: SDK INSTALL Having Problems Opening INSTALL.INF
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message occurs when attempting to install the Windows
Software Development Kit (SDK):

   Install is having problems opening INSTALL.INF
   Please check to see that this file is available.

CAUSE
=====

INSTALL searches the current directory for INSTALL.INF; therefore, it must be
run from the floppy drive containing the install disk.

Note: the same problem occurs when INSTALL.INF resides on a CD-ROM disc and that
drive is not the current drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

Run INSTALL from the floppy or CD-ROM drive. For example, type

   " a: <CR> install " (without the quotation marks)

rather than:

   " a:install " (without the quotation marks)

Additional query words: 3.10 no32bit
