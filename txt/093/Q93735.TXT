======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When Novell NetWare connectivity is installed and subsequently removed from
Windows for Workgroups, NetWarn=1 is NOT removed from the [Windows] section of
the WIN.INI file.

Normally if the value of NetWarn= is 1, and if Novell NetWare connectivity is
installed, and if MSIPX and NETX are not loaded, the following warning message
appears when Windows for Workgroups is started:

   The NetWare Shell has not been loaded.
   All Network functions will be disabled.

If Novell NetWare connectivity is removed, the warning message does not appear
when Windows for Workgroups is started.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some applications, such as Fifth Generation Systems FastBack Plus Windows
version 1.0, may cause Windows for Workgroups to display the above warning
message, indicating that the NetWare shell has not been loaded, even though the
message may be invalid because Novell NetWare connectivity may not be installed.
This error may also cause the system to stop responding (hang).

Workaround
----------

To work around the problem, use a text editor to change the NetWarn= value to 0
in the [Windows] section of the WIN.INI file or remove the NetWarn= line
entirely.
