The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each time you run an MS-DOS-based application in standard mode of
either Windows or Windows for Workgroups, the size of DSWAP.EXE in
memory increases by 16 bytes. This guarantees that each MS-DOS session
starts at a unique address.

MS-DOS keeps track of per-process information such as open files using
the address of the program segment prefix. If the size of DSWAP did
not increase, two MS-DOS-based applications could be started with the
same program segment prefix, and the system would have difficulty
distinguishing between them.

Additional query words: 3.10
