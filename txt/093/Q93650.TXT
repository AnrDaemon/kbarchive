SYMPTOMS
========

When you view a document, you may experience the following symptoms:

 - Menus and toolbars disappear from Word.

 - The screen may appear blank. The desktop may not be visible.

 - A small toolbar, consisting of one button.

 - If you press the ESC key, the words "Repeat Value:8" may appear at the bottom
   of the screen.

CAUSE
=====

You are in full screen view. Users who are accustomed to WordPerfect frequently
work in this view.

This view is useful if you want to see as much of the document as possible while
you are working in it. If you do not see any part of your document, you are in
full screen view with no document open.

ESC key.

Method 2: If there is a document open, use the following steps:

WordPerfect Navigation Keys or WordPerfect Help, use the following steps:

1. Press ALT+H to display the Help menu.
