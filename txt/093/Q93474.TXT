PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER::1992 edition
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Cinemania for Windows 1992 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run Microsoft Multimedia Viewer (VIEWER.EXE) from File Manager and open
CINMANIA.MVB with the File Open command, the following error message displays if
you attempt to run ListMaker:

   There was an error writing this file. The disk may be full, or it may be
   write-protected.

Choosing the Cancel button allows you to enter ListMaker; however, another error
message is then displayed:

   This list has been corrupted.

WORKAROUND
==========

Start Cinemania by choosing the Cinemania icon in Program Manager or by
selecting Cinemania from the Windows 95 Start Menu and run ListMaker.

MORE INFORMATION
================

ListMaker allows you to create a list and add movies; however, if Cinemania is
opened as describe above, you cannot save the list. This happens because the
working directory for the ListMaker defaults to the CD-ROM drive.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Cinemania 1992. This problem was
corrected in Cinemania 1994.

Additional query words: 2.00 1992
