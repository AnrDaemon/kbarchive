SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to save a data file on a Novell Network using Macro Recorder,
you may receive the following message if the root directory of the intended
directory does not have full "write" privileges:

   Recorder Error:

   Cannot create the X:\XXX\XXX.rec file.
   Make sure the path and filename are correct, or if you are using a network,
   that you can write to it.

CAUSE
=====

When you use Novell NetWare, Macro Recorder cannot save files to a subdirectory
if the root directory of that mapped drive does not have full "write" privileges
regardless of the subdirectory's rights.

To view the rights in any directory, type the command "rights" (without the
quotation marks) at the network drive prompt. These rights are set by the system
administrator using the SYSCON menu utility or the GRANT and REVOKE command line
utilities.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use one of the following workarounds to correct this problem:

 - Grant the root directory "write" privileges.

 - Map root the intended subdirectory.

 - Save the data file elsewhere and copy the file back into the intended
   subdirectory.
