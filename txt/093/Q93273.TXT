SUMMARY
=======

The release notes for Video for Windows (VFW1.WRI) decribes the procedure for
installing the run-time files. Installation of the run-time files makes several
changes to the Windows files and directories.

The contents of the WIN.INI, SYSTEM.INI, and REG.DAT files are modified as
follows:

WIN.INI
-------

   [mci extensions]
   avi=AVIVideo

   [embedding]
   MPlayer=Media Clip,Media Clip,mplayer.exe,picture

   [drawdib]
   display.drv=
   Result8=
   Result16=
   Result24=

NOTE: the entries to the right of the equal (=) sign in each of the lines in the
[drawdib] section will depend on the video driver being used.

SYSTEM.INI
----------

   [mci]
   AVIVideo=mciavi.drv

   [drivers]
   VIDC.MSVC=msvidc.drv
   VIDC.RT21=indeo.drv

REG.DAT
-------

The MPLAYER.REG file is merged with the existing REG.DAT file.

Files that are added in the WINDOWS directory:

   MPLAYER.EXE     113472 10-28-92  12:00a
   MPLAYER.HLP      78201 10-28-92  12:00a
   MPLAYER.REG        667 10-28-92  12:00a
   MCIOLE.DLL        8604 10-28-92  12:00a

NOTE: The MPLAYER.EXE and MPLAYER.HLP files replace the files with the same name
that ship with Windows version 3.1.

Files that are added in the SYSTEM directory:

   DISPDIB  DLL      5744 10-28-92  12:00a
   MSVIDEO  DLL     39584 10-28-92  12:00a
   MCIAVI   DRV     61136 10-28-92  12:00a
   MSVIDC   DRV     38432 10-28-92  12:00a
   INDEO    DRV    115552 10-28-92  12:00a
