TITLE   :Startup and Exit Sounds May Not Work with WFWG

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the sound files for Windows for Workgroups are on a network drive, the
Startup or Exit system sounds, which are assigned in the Sound section of
Control Panel, may not play when you start or exit Windows for Workgroups.

CAUSE
=====

The network redirector may not be active during the startup or exit of Windows
for Workgroups.

WORKAROUND
==========

Startup and Exit sounds should be placed on a local drive. Any other system
sound files can be placed on a network share.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On an installation created by SETUP /N on a Microsoft LAN Manager or Windows for
Workgroups server, the Startup and Exit sounds do work correctly; this is
because the real mode redirector is active.

On an installation created by SETUP /N on a Novell server, the sounds work only
if they are located on the Novell server. This is because MSIPX, not the real
mode redirector, is loaded.
