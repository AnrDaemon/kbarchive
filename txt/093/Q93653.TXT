-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

When running with MS-DOS version 6.x, Novell's NETX versions 3.31 and earlier
report the operating system version as MS-DOS 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NETX version 3.31 and earlier require MS-DOS 5.0 or earlier--it does not run
with MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2 unless you use SETVER.EXE to trick it. Since SETVER tells
NETX that the MS-DOS version is 5.0, NETX reports the MS-DOS version as 5.0.

This behavior could be a problem for network administrators who configure their
systems to map to specific directories for different versions of MS-DOS,
depending on the version reported by NETX. For example, suppose that machines
running MS-DOS 3.3 are mapped to Y:\DOS\V3.30 and machines running MS-DOS 5.0
are mapped to Y:\DOS\V5.00. In this example, when you use SETVER to tell NETX
you are running MS-DOS 5.0, you are logged onto the Y:\DOS\V5.00 directory.

NOTE: Novell's NETX.EXE version 3.32 is compatible with MS-DOS 6.x. The newer
version of NETX correctly reports the MS-DOS version and correctly maps the
directory. To obtain a new version of NETX.EXE contact Novell.

If you are using IPX, you can find the full NETX version number by using the NETX
/I command.
