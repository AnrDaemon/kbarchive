The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MS-DOS 6.0 and later allow you to bypass both AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS
by pressing the F5 key as you are starting your computer. This can disable
the effectiveness of some password-protection schemes. In order to disable
this feature, add the following line to CONFIG.SYS:

   " SWITCHES=/N " (without the quotation marks)

This line disables both the F5 and F8 keys, which allow you to modify your
startup configuration during the boot process. Note: This line can be put
anywhere in CONFIG.SYS.

Additional query words: 6.22 6.00 startup start up 6.20
