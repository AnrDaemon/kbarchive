-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If the OK and Browse buttons are unavailable (dimmed) for a particular file
extension in Windows version 3.1 File Manager when you choose Associate from the
File menu, then the file extension is on the "Programs=" line in the [Windows]
section of the WIN.INI file.

If a file extension is on the "Programs=" line under Windows version 3.0, the
Associate option is unavailable in File Manager when you attempt to associate
the file extension with an application.

To associate the file extension with an application, remove the file extension
from the "Programs=" line in the [Windows] section of the WIN.INI.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows treats files whose file extensions are on the "Programs=" line as if
they are executable files.

To determine if the file extension in question is on the "Programs=" line, run
File Manager and look at the icon next to a file that has the file extension in
question. If the icon next to the file appears as a rectangular gray box with a
green bar across the top (or a rectangular box with a smaller rectangular box
within it), then that file extension is on the "Programs=" line within the
WIN.INI file.

The icon should appear exactly like the icons to the left of files with the .EXE,
.PIF, .COM, or .BAT file extensions.

The same behavior may occur if you try to associate a file without a file
extension.
