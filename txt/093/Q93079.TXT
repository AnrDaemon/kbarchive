TITLE   :How to Interpret Userlevel Output from READCFG.EXE

SUMMARY
=======

READCFG.EXE will display information about LAN Manager resources and
configuration information. One entry is "userlevel" under the Auxilary data
field. The number that follows userlevel can be interpreted as follows:

   0 - Unlimited server
   2 - 10-user server
   4 - 20-user server
   6 - 30-user server
   8 - 40-user server
   10 - 50-user server
   12 - 60-user server

Any server that has more than five Additional User Paks on it will automatically
become an unlimited server, so userlevel will never be greater than 12.

Additional query words: 2.10
