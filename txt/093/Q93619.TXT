PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5x,2.6x,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6x 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After using RQBE to create a query that sends its output to a graph, a dialog
box containing the message "Here is your Graph" is displayed, accompanied by a
blank box.

CAUSE
=====

FoxPro cannot locate the Microsoft Graph utility using the settings currently
listed in your WIN.INI file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use a text editor to view your WIN.INI file, which is located in your WINDOWS
subdirectory (by default, C:\WINDOWS). In the [embedding] section, search for an
entry such as the following:

   MSGraph=Microsoft Graph,Microsoft Graph,
   C:\Windows\msapps\MSGRAPH\graph.exe,picture

NOTE: In your WIN.INI file, such entries appear on a single line.

Verify that the GRAPH.EXE file exists in the path specified in this entry. If an
MSGraph= line does not appear in your WIN.INI file, use this example as a
template to create an entry, then specify the correct path to the Microsoft
Graph utility.
