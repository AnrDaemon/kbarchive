SUMMARY
=======

After Dark's MS-DOS-based screen saver, AD_DOS.COM, can corrupt the screen
during MS-DOS Setup if it is allowed to clear the image on the screen and
replace it with a screen saver image.

Once the screen saver activates, you can return to a normal screen by pressing
any key. However, if this occurs during Setup, the restored screen is filled
with random characters. Setup continues to function correctly, but you may have
difficulty understanding the prompts.
