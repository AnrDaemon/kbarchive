MORE INFORMATION
================

Attempting to Lock - Press ESC to Cancel
----------------------------------------

This error usually appears when a command that performs an automatic or a manual
lock is unsuccessful. It appears in place of the SET MESSAGE message when
REPROCESS is set to -2, 0, or automatic, and NOTIFY is set on.

Cannot write to read only file (111)
------------------------------------

This error usually appears when the user attempts to change a file that has been
marked read-only. The error appears in a FoxPro error message box.

Exclusive open of file is required (110)
----------------------------------------

This error appears when an INDEX ON, INSERT, MODIFY STRUCTURE, PACK, REINDEX, or
ZAP command is issued for a database that is not open for exclusive access. This
error appears in a FoxPro error message box.

File access denied (1705)
-------------------------

This error appears when the user attempts to open a database for exclusive access
and the database is already opened by another user. It also appears when the
user attempts to open a database that is already opened for exclusive access by
another user. This error appears in a FoxPro error message box.

File in use by another (108)
----------------------------

This error is displayed in a FoxPro error message box, and appears when one of
the following occurs:

 - FoxPro attempts to lock a file when the file or a record is locked by another
   user.

   -or-

 - The user presses the ESC key in response to the "Attempting to lock" error
   message.

   -or-

 - You try to save an additional file to the root directory when the maximum
   number (512) of subdirectories and files already exist in the MS-DOS root
   directory


Record in use by another (109)
------------------------------

This error appears when the user attempts to lock a record using an automatic
locking command when the record is locked by another user. This error also
appears when the user presses the ESC key in response to the "Attempting to
lock" or "Waiting for lock" error messages. This error appears in a FoxPro error
message box.

Record not available. Please wait
---------------------------------

This error appears when a command that performs an automatic or manual lock is
unable to lock a record because the record is part of a transaction for another
user. This error appears in place of the SET MESSAGE message when the
NETWARE.PLB library is used to implement Novell Transaction Processing and the
"live lock" condition described above occurs.

This error can also be caused if VSHARE is not loaded. For more information about
the absence of VSHARE causing this error message, please see the following
