TITLE   :PC Win: Setup Does Not Change Language for Speller
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, with the
spell checking facility for one language, then install Mail with the spell
checking facility for another language, spell checking will not work. If you try
to check spelling in a message, Mail for Windows reports an error in loading the
spell checker.

CAUSE
=====

The Mail for Windows SETUP.EXE program adds or updates country information for
the Spelling entry in the [Proofing Tools] section of WIN.INI, but does not
update the [Proofing Tools] section in the MSMAIL.INI file.

As a result, the MSMAIL.INI Spelling entry retains an outdated language setting
if you re-install.

RESOLUTION
==========

Find the correct language number under Spelling entry in the Proofing Tools
section of WIN.INI and insert it under Spelling entry in the Proofing Tools
section of MSMAIL.INI. Restart Mail for Windows.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install Mail for Windows with spell checking for a different language
over a previously installed Mail, Mail checks the current MSMAIL.INI to see if
it contains a Spelling entry. If an entry already exists, Mail leaves it intact
as an existing valid value. When you install a new language, Mail detects the
discrepancy between the entry you want and the current WIN.INI entry, so it
writes the new WIN.INI Spelling entry. But Mail still considers the existing
entry in the MSMAIL.INI to be correct, and does not update the MSMAIL.INI
entry.

When you install the United Kingdom version of Mail for Windows over the USA
version, the Mail spell checker appears to work, but it uses the USA English
dictionary, not the UK English dictionary which should have been installed.
