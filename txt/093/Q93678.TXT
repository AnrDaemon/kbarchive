MORE INFORMATION

Corrections to Minor Problems for Better Handling Bad Sectors
-------------------------------------------------------------

SMARTDrive version 4.1 includes the following corrections:

 - SMARTDrive now correctly deals with bad sectors.

 - SMARTDrive now correctly handles the int 21 function 68h (Commit File) carry
   flag.

SMARTDrive Now Supports DoubleSpace
-----------------------------------

If a DoubleSpace volume is mounted before SMARTDrive version 4.1 is loaded, it
caches the DoubleSpace host drives. This functionality is similar to the way
SMARTDrive versions 4.0 and 4.1 work with Stacker. The caching of DoubleSpace
through the host drive is accomplished using a special interface to the
DoubleSpace components.

If you specify a DoubleSpace drive on the SMARTDrive command line, you get the
following message:

   You must specify the host drive for a DoubleSpace drive.

To use SMARTDrive with DoubleSpace, you must specify the host drive.

If SMARTDrive is caching a DoubleSpace host drive, it lists DoubleSpace drives
with asterisks (*) to indicate that that caching is really done via the host
drive.
