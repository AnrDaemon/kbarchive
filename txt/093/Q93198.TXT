   hardware failure error 5736

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur if one of the following conditions exists:

 - You are using an IBM Token Ring network interface card (NIC) and there is a
   memory conflict caused by a non-standard ROM address.

 - You have an Intel EtherExpress 16 network interface card (NIC) and your AMI
   Plug and Play BIOS "Interrupts from Available" CMOS entry is set to something
   other than "Used by ISA Slot."


 - You are using an IBM Token Ring PCMCIA network adapter and the IBMTOKCS.DOS
   driver written specifically for it.

 - You are using an Intel EtherExpress 16 network adapter and another device in
   your computer (such as a SCSI controller) is using base address 0x300.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use any one of the following methods to work around this problem:

 - Add the following line to PROTOCOL.INI file in the [MS$IBMTR1] section:

   RAM=0xD800

   NOTE: This section can also be named [MS$IBMTR2], [MS$IBMTR3], or [MS$IBMTR4].

 - Set your AMI Plug and Play BIOS "Interrupts from Available" CMOS entry to
   "Used by ISA Slot."

 - Change the default RAM address for your IBM Token Ring PCMCIA network adapter
   from D800 to D400, and change the IRQ from 10 to 5.

 - Configure the Intel EtherExpress 16 card to use a different base address.
