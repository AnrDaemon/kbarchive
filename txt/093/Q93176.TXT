TITLE   :PC MAPI: Err Msg: MAPI ERROR: Unknown Recipient
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you follow the directions on the MAPI technical reference disk (included with
Microsoft Mail for Windows versions 3.0, 3.0b and 3.2) to create and use
HELPREQ.EXE, you may receive the following error after you try to send a help
request to yourself:

   MAPI ERROR: Unknown Recipient

CAUSE
=====

HELPREQ.EXE does not deliver the help request correctly because the code in the
HELPREQ.C F ProcessHelpRequest section interchanges the recipient name and the
recipient address values. It doesn't work when you send Mail to an address such
as /network/postoffice/johndoe. It does work correctly when you send Mail to a
resolved name (such as John Doe), contrary to what is listed on page 40 of the
Microsoft Mail 3.0 "Technical Reference."

The Microsoft Mail "Technical Reference" also shows incorrect syntax for the
address, omitting "ms:". It should be "ms:network/postoffice/johndoe" instead of
"/network/postoffice/johndoe".

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Mail for Windows
versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can resolve this problem by interchanging the values for "recip.lpszName"
and "recip.lpszAddress" in the following section of code in HELPREQ.C. The value
assignments shown below are correct.

Partial Section of Code for HELPREQ.C
-------------------------------------

     BOOL FProcessHelpRequest(HWND hDlg, BOOL fSend, BOOL fReadDialog)

      // Now we need to create a message with this file as the attachment
      recip.ulReserved = NULL;
      recip.ulRecipClass = MAPI_TO;
      GetDlgItemText(hDlg, IDD_TO, szValue, cbValue);
   -> recip.lpszName = NULL;
   -> recip.lpszAddress = szValue;
