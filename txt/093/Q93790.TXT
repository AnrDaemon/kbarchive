TITLE   :RipBAR 6.0 Not Compatible with Windows NT 3.5
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

RipBAR for Windows NT, version 6.0, is not compatible with Windows NT version
3.5.

The application starts, but it doesn't complete painting the screen and an error
message appears stating that the instruction at "0x00033d4b" referenced memory
at "0x00000021" and the memory could not be read.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the application is dereferencing a GDI object handle
as if it were a pointer. This doesn't cause a problem in Windows NT version 3.1,
but it causes an access violation in Windows NT version 3.5.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been confirmed with SoftDesign and an update is now available.
To obtain an update to RipBAR version 6.04, contact the author, Jonathan
Carroll, at one of the following addresses:
