SUMMARY
=======

The drive letter for a CD-ROM drive is assigned by the MSCDEX.EXE command in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file, not by the device specific driver in the CONFIG.SYS file.
MSCDEX.EXE loads the Microsoft CD-ROM Extensions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MSCDEX.EXE assigns a CD-ROM the next available drive letter. For example, if a
computer has two floppy drives (drives A and B) and one physical hard drive with
two partitions (drives C and D), then MSCDEX will assign the CD- ROM the drive
letter E. It is possible to specify a drive letter to the CD- ROM by using a
command line switch on the MSCDEX.EXE of /L:x, where x is the drive letter you
want to assign. To assign a CD-ROM the drive letter H, you would use the
following command:

   MSCDEX /L:H

When using a RAM Drive along with a CD-ROM, the RAM Drive will be assigned the
first available drive letter, because RAMDRIVE.SYS (which loads in the
CONFIG.SYS) is loaded before MSCDEX. The CD-ROM will then be assigned the second
available drive letter.
