TITLE   :Windows Sound System Will Not Load on Diskless Workstations

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Sound System, versions 1.0, 1.0a, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When installing Microsoft Windows Sound System on a diskless workstation either
from a network share directory or from the original floppy disks, the following
error message appears:

   Setup cannot find a drive with enough space to install

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error occurs because the SETUP.EXE program for the Windows Sound System is
hard coded to look at the local hard drive for available space. This message
will also appear when installing to a drive that physically does not contain
enough free disk space. The Windows Sound System requires between 1 and 10 MB of
free disk space, depending upon the configuration.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Windows Sound System version
1.0, 1.0a, and 2.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 1.00 Window network
