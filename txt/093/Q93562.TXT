SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.0, has three ways of notifying you that
new mail has arrived:

 - The mouse arrow turns into an envelope. For example, if you are in a Windows
   application and new mail arrives, you'll see the arrow momentarily change to
   an envelope, then back to an arrow. In other words, the envelope flashes.

 - When Mail is minimized and new mail arrives, you will notice letters sticking
   out of the slot of the Mail icon. If the slot is empty, no new mail has
   arrived.

 - You can choose to have your computer sound a chime when new mail arrives. To
   do this, choose Options from the Mail menu, then select Sound Chime. If you
   have a sound board, you can choose the Sound icon from the Windows Control
   Panel. You will see an options for New Mail Notification where you can assign
   a .WAV sound file. Then your computer will play the .WAV file when new mail
   arrives.

NOTE: Independent shareware developers have developed other methods of mail
notification. More information on this topic may be available from Microsoft
