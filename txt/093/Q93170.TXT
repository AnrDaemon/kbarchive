TITLE   :BUG: PWB Stores Tabstops Value Incorrectly in TOOLS.INI
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:2.0,2.1.49
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.1.49 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Programmer's Workbench (PWB) versions 2.0 and 2.1.49 do not correctly
save the value of the Tabstops editor switch to the TOOLS.INI file. PWB saves
only the first tab width number; subsequent values are lost. Switch settings are
used for the duration of the current PWB session. The dialog box that appears
after choosing the Save button in the Editor Settings dialog box indicates that
only the first setting in the Tabstops field is recognized.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use a text editor to modify the TOOLS.INI file appropriately. The text below
illustrates an example of the tabstops entry in the [PWB] section of the
TOOLS.INI file:

   [PWB]
   tabstops: 4 10 4

In this example, PWB assigns a tabstop to columns 4 and 10, and every subsequent
fourth column.

For more information on changing settings in the TOOLS.INI file, see section 6.6
of the Microsoft C/C++ "Environment and Tools" manual, beginning on page 130.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in PWB versions 2.0 and 2.1.49. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
