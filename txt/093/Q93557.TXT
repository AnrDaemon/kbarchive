TITLE   :Controlling the Maximum Open Volumes for LMSFM
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

On a server with many Macintosh machines connecting to many volumes, an

   AFP0033:Request to open too many volumes

error can be generated when the default limit of 40 concurrently mounted volumes
is reached.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An undocumented parameter can be added to the LANMAN.INI file in the [MacFile]
section that controls the number of maximum concurrently mounted volumes the
MACFILE service can support at once. This parameter, maxvolumesopen, is
defaulted at 40. Its range is 0-500. By adding it to the LANMAN.INI file as
shown below (and using an appropriate number), you can avoid the above error,
and the Macintosh users can mount the necessary volumes.

Example
-------

[MacFile]
maxvolumesopen = ###

  ; There are no mandatory settings for the MacFile service.
  ; See the "Administrator's Guide."

Additional query words: 1.00 AFP0033 MAC VOLUMES
