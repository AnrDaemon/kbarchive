SUMMARY
=======

AutoCAD technical support has confirmed that AutoCAD 386 version 12 may have
problems running in privileged mode under Windows 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To check to see if the customer is in privileged mode, type the following at the
ACAD directory and press ENTER:

   Cfig386 Acad

There should be a set of variables on the screen.

If you see the variable privileged, then the AutoCAD mode has been changed to
privileged. You must be in unprivileged mode to run in the Windows environment.

To Change from Privilege to Unprivileged Mode
---------------------------------------------

From within the ACAD directory:

1. Type the following and press ENTER:

   Cfig386 Acad -Clear

2. Type the following and press ENTER:

   Cfig386 Acad -MINSWFSIZE 400000 -SWAPDEFDISK -SWAPCHK OFF -DEMANDLOAD VSCAN
   20000 -UNPRIV

This resets AutoCAD to its default settings as well as sets the mode to
unprivileged.
