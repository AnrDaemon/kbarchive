TITLE   :Setup Is Unable to Read Uninstall Disk on a COMPAQ
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using SMARTDrive to cache a floppy disk on a COMPAQ machine, MS-DOS 6
and later Upgrade may be unable to read the Uninstall disk during installation.
Setup also may also repeatedly ask you to insert MS-DOS Upgrade Setup Disk 1
after you select the Windows-based and/or MS-DOS-based optional utilities.

CAUSE
=====

These problems are caused by a problem in the COMPAQ BIOS. They occur when
SMARTDrive is loaded in upper memory because all floppy disk data transfers go
through the upper memory blocks (UMBs).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file as follows so that it
loads SMARTDrive in conventional memory:

   smartdrv /l

If loading SMARTDrive low does not correct the situation, either configure
SMARTDrive for read-caching only (no write-cache) on the floppy disk drives, or
restart your computer without loading SMARTDrive before you run MS-DOS Upgrade
Setup.
