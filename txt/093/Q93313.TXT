section, using semicolons with each item, to look like this:

      [dontinstall]
      ;accessories
      ;readmes
      ;games
      ;screensavers
      ;bitmaps

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Microsoft Windows operating system 3.1, the [dontinstall] section is used to
specify components to be installed. If an item appears in this section, the
appropriate components were installed. In Windows for Workgroups, however, the
opposite is true -- any items appearing in this section (all by default) are not
installed.

If you have already completed installation, you can add any or all of these
components to your Windows for Workgroups installation by using the Add/Remove
Windows Components option on the Options menu of Windows for Workgroups Setup.
