TITLE   :PRB: Paste Link Command Not Available for Microsoft Graph
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5,2.5a,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to use the Paste Link command to link to a graph created in Microsoft
Graph fails.

CAUSE
=====

The Paste Link command links data contained in a separate file. To edit a data
file, the Paste Link command calls the server application associated with the
file. Microsoft Graph does not store data in a file; it graphs data received
from a client application.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
