SUMMARY
=======

Setup does not recognize OEM0000x.INF files if they are in the shared network
directory. To allow Setup to recognize these files and install third-party
drivers, the files must be in the user's individual Windows directory (where
WIN.COM and WIN.INI are stored).

OEMSETUP.INF files are correctly recognized in either shared or user
directories.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.

Additional query words: 3.10
