SUMMARY
=======

LOGSHOW is a utility that displays information about disk adapters, disk drives,
CD-ROM drives, and tape drives installed on the system. LOGSHOW resides in the
C:\OS2\SUPPORT directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The general format of an error log entry displayed by LOGSHOW is as follows:

   devnam cccc mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss - meaning of code
          additional information

The following are the standard error log entry displays:

devnam 000a mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss-Informational:Real ESDI inquiry data follows:
            00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 GENERIC ESDI DISK TYPEnn

         Where       Is
         ------      --

         devnam      Normally DEVINQ, which is the temporary device name
                     used while the device is being configured

         Where       Is
         -----       --

         devnam      The name of the physical disk drive that has just
                     been configured

         ggggg       Sector size in bytes

         hhhhhhhhh   The number of sectors on the physical volume

         iiiiii      The number of cylinders in the physical volume

         jjjj        The number of data heads accessing the physical
                     volume

         kkkk        The number of sectors per track

         llll        Flags, in hex, that show how the geometry data was
                     generated:

            0x8000      Apparent geometry was already set by the time that
                        the TSD first gained control.

            0x4000      Actual geometry was already set by the time that
                        the TSD first gained control

            0x2000      Actual geometry was set from the apparent geometry
                        by the TSD because the actual geometry was null

            0x1000      Apparent geometry was set from the ROM data (INT 13
                        function 8) by the TSD

            0x0800      Apparent geometry was set from the BPB in the
                        primary partition boot record by the TSD

            0x0400      Media BPB was initialized by the TSD

            0x0200      Recommended BPB was initialized by the TSD

            0x0100      Recommended BPB was set from the BPB in the primary
                        partition boot record by the TSD

            0x0080      Geometry set from ROM by BID

            0x0040      Geometry set from internal disk characteristics
                        table by BID

            0x0020      Geometry set using values determined through auto-
                        configuration by BID

            0x0010      Geometry set using values from INT 41 or INT 46 by
                        BID

            0x0008      Apparent and actual geometry set by BID

         mmmmm       The cylinder number from which write precompensation
                     is to be used

         nnn         The cluster size

         ppppp       The number of reserved sectors

         qqq         The number of FATs

         rrrrr       The number of directory entries

         sssss       The number of sectors in the partition, if less than
                     65,536 sectors

         tt          The media descriptor, in hex

         uuuuu       The number of sectors used by each FAT

         vvvvv       The number of sectors per track

         wwwww       The number of heads

         xxxxxxxxx   The number of hidden sectors

         yyyyyyyyy   The number of sectors in the partition, if more than
                     65,535 sectors
