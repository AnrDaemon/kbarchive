SUMMARY
=======

The NCR Wavelan card is a wireless Ethernet card that operates on radio waves.
To function correctly with Novell NetWare, it requires the following entry in
the [MS$IPX] section of the PROTOCOL.INI file:

      MediaType=Ethernet_II

If the Novell/Ethernet Media Type is incorrectly specified for the NCR Wavelan
card and MSIPX.SYS, MSIPX.COM, and NETX.COM are loading, the system may hang
when NETX loads, or you may receive a file server error message.

You can set the MediaType in the Networks dialog box of Control Panel.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Ethernet_II entry sets up the media access control (MAC) driver to receive
DIX Ethernet frame types, rather than 802.3 (Novell/Ethernet). Many of the
Novell file servers with these cards are using 802.3. The server must also be
modified to support the Ethernet_II frame type by adding the line "ethernetii"
to the NET.CFG file.

To change the setting through Control Panel:

1. In the Control Panel window, choose the Network icon.

2. Choose the Adapters button.

3. Choose the Setup button and select Protocols.

4. Select Novell IPX and choose the Settings button.

5. Change the value of Media Type to Ethernet_II, then choose the OK button.
