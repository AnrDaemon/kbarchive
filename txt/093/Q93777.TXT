The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You receive a corrupt swap file warning message from Windows after you remove a
compressed drive.

CAUSE
=====

Because you remove a compressed drive manually, DoubleSpace cannot update
permanent or temporary swap file settings in SYSTEM.INI or SPART.PAR. Drive
letters change resulting in the corrupt swap file warning because Windows cannot
find the swap file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To restore your swap file settings, run the 386 Enhanced icon from Control
Panel.
