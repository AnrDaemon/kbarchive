The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

If the print quality mode on a Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet 500 printer is set
for non-draft or letter quality printing, you cannot print TrueType fonts by
selecting Draft Mode in the Printer Setup dialog box if you are using the
following printer driver:

 - The HP DeskJet driver version 1.1 that ships with Windows 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The HP DeskJet 500 Printer Owner's Manual states that selections made through
your software always override hardware settings. However, if the printer is
configured for letter quality output, this setting will override any software
settings made in Windows 3.1.

If the printer is configured for draft mode, software settings will override the
hardware settings. Therefore, if the printer is set for draft mode, TrueType
fonts can be printed in both draft and letter quality.

Printer fonts are not affected and can be overridden by software selections in
either mode on the HP DeskJet 500.
