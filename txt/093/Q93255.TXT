SUMMARY
=======

If you install Microsoft Video for Windows 1.0 on a machine equipped with the
Action Media II capture card and you run the VidCap utility that is included
with Video, you may receive the following initialization error:

   VidCap could not initialize the capture device. Capture driver is not
   installed properly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Indeo (TM) Video driver is installed for software only compression and
decompression when Microsoft Video for Windows is installed. No further setup is
required for software only operation. If you have an Action Media II capture
card in your computer, you will need to re-install the capture driver to get
hardware assisted playback and to capture video with the VidCap utility included
with Microsoft Video for Windows.

To install, remove, or configure a capture driver you need to use the Drivers
option in the Control Panel.

For more information on installing device drivers, refer to your Windows 3.1
manual.
