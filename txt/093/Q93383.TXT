SUMMARY
=======

Using File Manager to create a disk label containing a space character generates
the following error message:

   

   File Manager cannot label the disk.

   Make sure the disk is not write-protected, is not a network
   drive, and that the label is valid.

   Labels cannot contain the following characters:
   [space] * ? / \ | . , ; : + = [ ] ( ) & ^ < > "

The error message is correct, but confusing because all versions of MS-DOS allow
space characters in a disk label.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 517 of the "Microsoft MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference" manual for MS-DOS
version 5.0 includes the following misleading statement:

   A volume label can contain as many as 11 characters and can include spaces
   but no tabs. Consecutive spaces may be interpreted as a single space.

Using the MS-DOS label command to create a label of "A B C D E F" will return a
label of "A B C D.E F". Because the first eight characters of an MS-DOS filename
cannot end in a space, one or more spaces will be removed and a period inserted.
For reasons such as this, it was decided to simplify the label parsing
validation in File Manager to disallow space characters.
