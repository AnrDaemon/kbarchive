======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
 - the operating system: MS-DOS, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you switch between a LaserMaster WinJet 300 and a WinJet 800, you receive
the following printer error message:

   WinPrint Manager
   Printer Error: VPD cannot register frame buffer

Other error messages are then displayed.

CAUSE
=====

If you switch between a LaserMaster WinJet 300 and a WinJet 800 must manually
edit the SYSTEM.INI file. The printer errors occur if you fail to do this.

WORKAROUND
==========

WinJet 300
----------

The WinJet 300 installation adds the following lines to the [386Enh] section of
the SYSTEM.INI file:

   device=LMLPV.386 ;WinPrint
   device=LMCAP.386 ;WinPrint
   device=LMMI.386  ;WinPrint

When you install a WinJet 300 over an existing WinJet 800, the installation
process does not remove the line (device=LMHAROLD.386 ;WinPrint). You must do
this manually, as follows:

1. Make a backup copy of your SYSTEM.INI by copying the file to SYSTEM.BAK.

2. Open the SYSTEM.INI in a text editor (NOTEPAD.EXE).

3. Place a semicolon in front of the device=LMHAROLD.386 line in the [386Enh]
   section of the SYSTEM.INI file.

   The line should appear as in the sample below:

      [386Enh]
      device=LMLPV.386 ;WinPrint
      ;device=LMHAROLD.386 ;WinPrint
      device=LMCAP.386 ;WinPrint
      device=LMMI.386 ;WinPrint

WinJet 800
----------

The WinJet 800 installation adds the following lines to the [386Enh] section of
the SYSTEM.INI file:

   device=LMHAROLD.386 ;WinPrint
   device=LMCAP.386 ;WinPrint
   device=LMMI.386 ;WinPrint

When you install a WinJet 800 over an existing WinJet 300, the installation
process does not remove the line (device=LMLPV.386 ;WinPrint). You must do this
manually as follows:

1. Make a backup copy of your SYSTEM.INI by copying the file to SYSTEM.BAK.

2. Open the SYSTEM.INI in a text editor (NOTEPAD.EXE).

3. Place a semicolon in front of the device=LMLPV.386 line in the [386Enh]
   section of the SYSTEM.INI.

   The line should appear as in the sample below:

      [386Enh]
      ;device=LMLPV.386 ;WinPrint
      device=LMHAROLD.386 ;WinPrint
      device=LMCAP.386 ;WinPrint
      device=LMMI.386 ;WinPrint
