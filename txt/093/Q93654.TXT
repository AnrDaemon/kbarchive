SUMMARY
=======

If you use multiple configurations in your CONFIG.SYS file, you should use a
[common] section for the device drivers and environment statements you would
normally use for all of your configurations.

If you place the [common] section at the end of your CONFIG.SYS file, you greatly
increase the chances that a setup or installation program will correctly update
your CONFIG.SYS file.

For example, when you install a CD-ROM drive, the installation software adds the
device driver to the CONFIG.SYS file. It will probably add the device driver at
the bottom, in the [common] section. If you had [Development] as your last
section, the CD-ROM driver would be available only under that configuration,
instead of every configuration.
