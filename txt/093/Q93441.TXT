TITLE   :Microsoft TCP/IP 2.1a with Windows for Workgroups
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

On page E-5 of the Microsoft Windows for Workgroups "Resource Kit" version 3.1
manual, the device driver name in the [ms$tcp] section of the PROTOCOL.INI file
is incorrectly shown in lowercase letters:

[ms$tcp]
  ...
  drivername=tcpip$

The drivername should be uppercase, as follows:

[ms$tcp]
  ...
  drivername=TCPIP$

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you do not use uppercase letters for drivername, TCPDRV.DOS fails to
initialize in CONFIG.SYS, with no explanation.

LAN Manager 2.2 includes a protocol disk in Windows for Workgroups format, so you
can ignore the NDIS transport protocol integration procedure described in the
"Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit."
