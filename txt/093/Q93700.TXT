SYMPTOMS
========

If you enter a space after your logon name when logging into the Windows for
Workgroups (WFWG) Schedule+ application, the following error message occurs when
WFWG attempts to move the local .CAL file from within Schedule+:

   There is not enough memory to display this dialog box. Please close some
   windows and try again.

The error message can also occur when you choose Create Archive or Export
Appointments from the Schedule+ File menu.

WORKAROUND
==========

Edit the SCHDPLUS.INI file using the steps outlined below to resolve the
problem:

1. Open the SCHDPLUS.INI file using a text editor such as Notepad.

2. In the [Microsoft Schedule+] section of the file, the path and filename of
   the local .CAL file appears as follows

      LocalPath=D:\WFW\USER .CAL

   where USER is the user name used at logon.

3. Delete the space immediately following the user name. For example:

      LocalPath=D:\WFW\USER.CAL

4. Save the SCHDPLUS.INI file.

5. Close Notepad and restart Schedule+.

The local .CAL file can now be moved without errors.
