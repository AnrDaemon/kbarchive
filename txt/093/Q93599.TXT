The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you run DoubleSpace with the /CHKDSK switch (for example, type DBLSPACE
/CHKDSK) on a DoubleSpace partition, it analyzes the DoubleSpace file allocation
table (FAT) for consistency. The DoubleSpace FAT is a separate data structure
from the MS-DOS FAT.

To check the DoubleSpace FAT and the MS-DOS FAT, you must run both DBLSPACE
/CHKDSK and CHKDSK on the DoubleSpace drive. To analyze and repair any problems,
add the /F switch to both commands.

NOTE: If CHKDSK, or CHKDSK /F, is run on a compressed drive, it automatically
runs DBLSPACE /CHKDSK, or DBLSPACE /CHKDSK /F,when finished. If DBLSPACE /CHKDSK
is not invoked, check to make sure DBLSPACE.EXE is located in the same directory
as CHKDSK.EXE.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MS-DOS maintains a data structure for the FAT that maintains a "map" of the disk
usage (both files and free space) recording the status of each sector on the
disk. When DoubleSpace is installed, it creates its own FAT and maps the MS-DOS
FAT to the DoubleSpace FAT.
