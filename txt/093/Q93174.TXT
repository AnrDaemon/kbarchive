TITLE   :FIX: CVW Does Not Trace Into QuickWin FORTRAN Subprograms
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER::3.06,3.07,4.0,4.01
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for Windows, versions 3.06, 3.07, 4.0, 4.01 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When CodeView for Windows (CVW) is running in version 3.1 of the Microsoft
Windows graphical environment, CVW does not trace into the subprograms of an
application written in FORTRAN and compiled as a QuickWin application. The Step
Into key (F8) acts as a Step Over (F10) and skips to the instruction that
follows the current routine.

RESOLUTION
==========

Place a break point in the desired subprogram and continue execution. CodeView
halts execution at the breakpoint as desired.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in CodeView versions 3.06, 3.07,
4.0, and 4.01 for Windows. This problem was corrected in CodeView version 4.1
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the sample code below, select the print statement and press the F9 key to set
a break point. Use the F10 key to step through the code. CodeView stops on the
print statement in the sub1 subprogram.

Sample Code
-----------

   C --------------------------------------
   C compile options: /MW /Od /Zi
   C --------------------------------------

         call sub1()
         end

         subroutine sub1()
         print *,'Inside sub1'
         end
