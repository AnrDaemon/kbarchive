TITLE   :Unable to Connect to a Server Using Thomas Conrad TC6242 Card
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use a Thomas Conrad TC6242 network adapter card with Windows for
Workgroups, you must set the card for enhanced mode. If the card is set for
compatible mode, you cannot connect to resources from Microsoft MS-DOS. If you
try to connect to a server from Windows, you receive the following error
message:

   Unable to read from drive <x>

where "x" is the drive letter of the server to which you are trying to connect.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, set the jumper on the TC6242 card to enhanced mode by
setting the eighth pin on switch block sw1 to the down position (On).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Enhanced Mode
-------------

Enhanced mode should be used when you want to optimize communication performance
and minimize memory address conflicts with other hardware. This mode is also
designed for the Thomas Conrad accelerated drivers, which feature expanded
memory addressing options and faster data transfer. In enhanced mode, the
adapter's base I/O address is memory mapped. Enhanced mode is the default
setting for this card.

Compatible Mode
---------------

Compatible mode should be used when you are using third-party drivers. This mode
operates with any Novell RX-Net-compatible driver or the Thomas Conrad GXL/ARC
driver (a global, high performance network shell driver for ArcNet adapters). In
this mode, the adapter's I/O address must be manually set on switch block sw3.
