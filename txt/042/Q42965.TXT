TITLE   :Banking in Slow Flight Causes Climb in Flight Simulator

SUMMARY
=======

When a real airplane is put into a bank, lift is reduced, causing the plane to
sink (i.e., lose altitude).

However, when Flight Simulator Versions 3.00 and 4.00 are put into a bank during
slow flight (80 knots or less), the plane will climb in a sharp turn, resulting
in a pitch up and stall.

To counteract this response, apply forward stick (down elevator) by pressing the
UP ARROW key.

Examples of slow-flight situations are landing approaches and high-altitude
flying.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Flight Simulator. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.
