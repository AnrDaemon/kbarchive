TITLE   :Pages Do Not Expire as Expected After Web Site Content Change
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you change content on a Web site, the changes do not appear as expected.
Instead, Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 shows the old content.

CAUSE
=====

This can occur if HTTP compression is enabled on the Web server. Enabling HTTP
compression introduces a new metabase key named HcCacheControlHeader. The
default value of HcCacheControlHeader is set to max-age=86400 (that is, 86400
seconds). This means that the Web site stays in the cache of the browser for 24
hours.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. On your server, open a command prompt.

2. Change to your <X>:\InetPub\AdminScripts folder, where <X> is the
   drive that you specified for your IIS documents.

3. Run the following command:

   CSCRIPT.EXE ADSUTIL.VBS SET
   W3SVC/Filters/Compression/Parameters/HcCacheControlHeader "max-age=0"

4. Stop and restart the IISAdmin service.

5. Restart the WWW service.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the client refreshes the content (for example, by pressing the F5 key), the
IIS cache is updated and shows the changed content.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Setting the value of Response.Expires to 0 in the relevant ASP page does not
resolve the issue.
