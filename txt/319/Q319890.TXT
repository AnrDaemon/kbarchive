SYMPTOMS
========

When you send mail to your Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 computer from an Active
Server Pages (ASP) page that uses Collaboration Data Objects for Windows NT
Server (CDONTS), you may receive the following error message:

   80070003 "Path not found error"

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, make sure that the Exchange Server Internet Mail Service
is installed and working correctly on your computer. Next, verify that the
registry settings for Exchange Server are correct. After you verify that the
registry settings are correct, you may want to reinstall Internet Explorer 4.01,
and then modify the Internet Information Service (IIS) metafile.

NOTE: Internet Explorer 4.01 is required for the Windows NT Option Pack that
installs IIS. It adds needed components to IIS. Reinstall Internet Explorer 4.01
to make sure that all required objects are available in IIS.

Verify that the Internet Mail Service Is Installed
--------------------------------------------------

To verify that the Internet Mail Service is installed and is working properly,
follow these steps:

1. Click Start, click Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. In Control Panel, double-click Services.

3. In the list of Services, locate Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Service, and
   then make sure that Status is listed as Started. If nothing appears in the
   Status column for the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Service, click Start
   to start Internet Mail Service.

4. Click Close.

Verify Exchange Server Registry Settings
----------------------------------------

To verify the correct Exchange Server registry settings, follow these steps:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot

incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "regedt32" (without the quotation marks), and then
   click OK.

3. In the Registry Editor, locate the following subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Active Messaging\Use Exchange

4. Make sure that this entry is set to a value of "1" (without the quotation
   marks).

5. In the Registry Editor, locate the following subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Active Messaging

6. On the Security menu, click Permissions.

7. Select Everyone in the Name list in the Registry Key Permissions dialog box,
   and then click Full Control in the "Type of Access" list.

8. Click OK.

9. In the Registry Editor, locate the following subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters\RootDir

10. Double-click the RootDir value, note the path that appears in the String
   text box, and then append this value by typing "\pickup" (without the
   quotation marks) at the end of the path.

11. Click OK.

12. Open Windows Explorer, and then locate the path that you edited in step 10.

13. Make sure that a folder named "Pickup" is located in this path. If no Pickup
   folder exists, click File, click New, and then click Folder. Type "Pickup"
   (without the quotation marks) for the folder name, and then press ENTER.

14. Right-click the folder, and then select Properties.

15. In the Properties dialog box, click Security, and then click Permissions.

Use Mdutil to Modify the MetaFile

Optionally, you can modify the metafile when you use the Mdutil.exe utility that
is included in the Windows NT Option Pack.

To use Mdutil.exe, follow these steps:

1. Copy the Mdutil.exe file from either the Windows NT Option Pack CD-ROM or the
   Windows 2000 CD-ROM to your System32 folder.

2. Click Start, and then click Run.

3. In the Run dialog box, type "cmd" (without the quotation marks), and then
   press ENTER.

4. In the Command window, type the following command

   mdutil set SmtpSvc/1 -prop 36880 -dtype STRING -value
   "<drive>:\exchsrvr\imcdata\Pickup" -s gozer

where <drive>:\exchsrvr\imcdata\Pickup is the full path to the Pickup
directory for your Exchange Server. NOTE: If you need help using the Mdutil.exe
utility, type "mdutil" (without the quotation marks) in the Command window.
