MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Behavior
-------------------------------

Paste the following code in a program (.prg) file, and then run the program from
the Command window of Visual FoxPro 7.0 build 9262:

   CLOSE DATABASES all
   CLEAR 

   *!************************************
   *!* Create sample data
   CREATE TABLE testTable (cField1 C(10))
   USE

   CREATE DATABASE testDBC
   CREATE CONNECTION testConn ;
      CONNSTRING "Driver={Microsoft Visual FoxPro Driver};" + ;
         "SourceDB=" + SYS(5) + CURDIR() + ";SourceType=DBF"
   *!* Note: This view cannot be updated.
   CREATE SQL VIEW testView CONNECTION testConn AS ;
      SELECT * ;
         FROM testTable
   CLOSE DATABASES ALL

   *!****************************
   *!* Behavior without buffering.
   ? "Without Buffering"

   OPEN DATABASE testDBC
   USE testView

   *!* The APPEND BLANK command and REQUERY() function trigger the behavior.
   APPEND BLANK
   REQUERY()
   ? RECCOUNT()  

   BEGIN TRANSACTION
   APPEND BLANK
   APPEND BLANK
   ?RECCOUNT()  

   END TRANSACTION
   ?RECCOUNT()  
   CLOSE DATABASES ALL

   *!*************************
   *!* Behavior with buffering.
   ? "With Buffering"

   OPEN DATABASE testDBC
   USE testView
   CURSORSETPROP("Buffering", 5)

   APPEND BLANK
   APPEND BLANK 

   BEGIN TRANSACTION 
   TABLEUPDATE(1)
   END TRANSACTION
   ?RECCOUNT() 
   REQUERY()   && Resets view to 0

   APPEND BLANK
   APPEND BLANK

   BEGIN TRANSACTION
   TABLEUPDATE(1)
   ?RECCOUNT()  
   END TRANSACTION
   ?RECCOUNT()  

After you run the code, you expect to see the following:

   Without Buffering:
            0
            2
            2
   With Buffering:
            2
            2
            2

However, in Visual FoxPro 7.0 build 9262, you receive the following results:

   Without Buffering:
            0
            2
            1
   With Buffering:
            2
            2
            0

Note that without buffering, all but one of the records disappear after the END
TRANSACTION command. With buffering, all of the records disappear.
