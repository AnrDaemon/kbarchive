PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0 SP3,2.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool kbui kbsms200 kbsms200preSP4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0 SP3, 2.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The TravelMode discovery property may not be reported in client discovery
properties in the SMS Administrator tool or its associated DDR after you apply
the hotfix that is described in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

   Q281107 Travel-Mode Clients May Lose Inventory or Not Run Advertisements

This affects existing Microsoft Windows NT clients on which the SMS Client was
installed with the Windows NT Remote Client Installation. This includes SMS
component servers on which the SMS Client was installed by using the SMS Windows
NT Service Discovery Agent/Windows NT Remote Client Installation combination.
However, new clients that are installed after the hotfix from Q281107 has been
installed report the new property in their discovery data.

CAUSE
=====

The clients Ccmdata.tcf file that is located in the
%systemroot%\MS\SMS\Core\Data folder only exists for clients that are installed
by using the Windows NT Remote Client Installation method. The discovery
properties to be collected during the discovery process are contained in the
[DISCOVERY PROPERTIES] section of this file. This file is not updated when the
hotfix from Q281107 is applied.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

   http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

How to Install the Hotfix
-------------------------

Apply this fix on all of the sites in the SMS hierarchy. To install the fix, use
one of the following methods.

How to Use the Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: You can use this method only on Intel-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a local folder on your site server or to
   a share on your network. The I386 and Alpha subfolders are required; you must
   also download them from the Microsoft FTP site. It is important to keep the
   folder structure intact. The Q319462.exe file is a Microsoft Windows
   Installer file that updates specific files on your site server.

2. Log on to your site server by using an account with administrator rights.

3. On the site server, quit the SMS Administrator console.

4. Run the Q319462.exe file and follow the instructions in the wizard. The SMS
   services are stopped and restarted as part of the installation process.

How to Manually Install the Hotfix:

1. Copy the update program file (Q319462.exe) and platform folders to a new
   folder. The folder structure must be such that the program file is located
   one folder "above" the platform folders.

2. Quit the SMS Administrator console and stop all SMS services in Control
   Panel. If the SMS_SITE_BACKUP service is running, stop it also.

3. Replace the Clicore.exe file in the
   SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base\<platform> folder with the version that is
   located in the hotfix <platform> folder.

4. Replace the Compver.ini file in the SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base folder with
   the Compverbase.ini file that is located in the hotfix <platform>
   folder. The file should maintain its original name of Compver.ini.

5. Replace the Ccmcore.exe file in the
   SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base\<platform> folder with the version that is
   located in the hotfix <platform> folder.

6. Replace the Apasetup.exe file in the
   SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base\<platform> folder with the version that is
   located in the hotfix <platform> folder.

7. Replace the Compver.ini file in the SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Smsapm32 folder
   with the Compversmsapm32.ini file that is located in the hotfix
   <platform> folder. The file should maintain its original name of
   Compver.ini.

8. Replace the Swdist32.exe file in the
   SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\SWDist\<platform> folder with the version that
   is located in the hotfix <platform> folder.

9. Replace the Compver.ini file in the SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\SWDist folder
   with the Compverswdist.ini file that is located in the hotfix
   <platform> folder. The file should maintain its original name of
   Compver.ini.

10. Replace the Bindclin.dll file in the SMS\Bin\<platform> folder with
   the version that is located in the hotfix <platform> folder.

11. Replace the CCIM32.DLL file in the SMS\Bin\<platform> folder with the
   version that is located in the hotfix <platform> folder.

12. Replace the Clisvcl.exe file in the SMS\Bin\<platform> folder with the
   version that is located in the hotfix <platform> folder.

13. Replace the Cqmgr32.dll file in the SMS\Bin\<platform> folder with the
   version that is located in the hotfix <platform> folder.

14. Replace the Mslmclin.dll file in the SMS\Bin\<platform> folder with
   the version that is located in the hotfix <platform> folder.

15. Replace the Ndsclin.dll file in the SMS\Bin\<platform> folder with the
   version that is located in the hotfix <platform> folder.

16. Replace the Odpsys32.exe file in the SMS\Bin\<platform> folder with
   the version that is located in the hotfix <platform> folder.

17. Replace the Odpusr32.exe file in the SMS\Bin\<platform> folder with
   the version that is located in the hotfix <platform> folder.
