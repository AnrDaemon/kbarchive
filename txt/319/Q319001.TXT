OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbCodeSnippet kbvfp700 _IK283 kbVFP700sp1fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SEEK(), the INDEXSEEK(), and the LOOKUP() functions may find nonexistent
records when you use the functions with the SET KEY command.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q316964 How to Obtain the Latest Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0.

This problem was first corrected in Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0 Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Paste the following code in a program (.prg) file, and then run the program from
the Command window:

   * Clear the screen
   CLEAR
   lcTestVal=PADL(1, 10, '0')
   CREATE CURSOR crsTest ( cTest C(10))

   INDEX ON cTest TAG cTest

   * Insert a record into the cursor
   INSERT INTO crsTest (cTest) VALUES (lcTestVal)

   * Limit the range of records that can be accessed. In this case
   * this should eliminate all of the records.
   SET KEY TO '1234567890'
   ? 'SEEK() Results ', SEEK(lcTestVal)
   ? 'INDEXSEEK() Results', INDEXSEEK(lcTestVal)
   ? 'LOOKUP() Results ', LOOKUP(crsTest.cTest, lcTestVal, crsTest.cTest,'cTest')

   ? 
   SEEK lcTestVal
   ? 'SEEK  Results ', FOUND()

   LOCATE FOR cTest = lcTestVal
   ? 'LOCATE Results ', FOUND() 

Note that the SEEK(), the INDEXSEEK(), and the LOOKUP() functions find a
nonexistent record, but the SEEK and the LOCATE commands work correctly.
