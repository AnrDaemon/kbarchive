TITLE   :Winsock Control May Fire DataArrival Event After the Close Event
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCtrl kbVBp600bug kbWinsock

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Winsock control may fire a DataArrival event with valid data length (a number
that is greater than 0) after the Close event. If you try to call the GetData
method for that event, you receive the following error message:

   Run-time error: 40006

   Wrong protocol or connection state for the requested transaction or request.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because of a bug in the Winsock control. Although the
occurrence of this problem depends on data flow between two entities, the
problem may occur more consistently when the client (receiver) application is
much slower than the server (transmitter) application, and when no
application-level flow control is implemented.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
it has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to computers
that are experiencing this specific problem.

NOTE: You must have a Visual Studio license agreement to obtain this fix.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
