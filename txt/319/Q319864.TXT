TITLE   :SMS: Upgrade to SP4 Does Not Cause Inventory Resynchronization
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0

SUMMARY
=======

A Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) upgrade does not
cause full inventory resynchronizations to be generated by clients.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For software inventory, clients are not instructed by the Software Inventory
installation routine to generate a full inventory on the next cycle.

For hardware inventory, unlike previous service pack upgrades, upgrading from SMS
2.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) to SMS 2.0 SP4 does not force a resynchronization of
the hardware or software inventory for all existing SMS clients. Because there
were changes to the Sms_def.mof file between SMS 2.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2) and
SMS 2.0 SP3, a hardware inventory resynchronization does occur if you upgrade
from SMS 2.0 SP2 to SMS 2.0 SP4.

For information about preserving custom hardware inventory settings that are
defined in the Sms_def.mof file, see the "Restore Custom Data Before Completing
Site Upgrade" section of the "Microsoft Systems Management Server Version 2.0
Service Pack 4 Installation Release Notes" document.
