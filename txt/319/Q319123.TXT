PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On your Microsoft Windows NT 4.0-based computer, you may receive a STOP 0x50
error message similar to one of the following on a blue screen:

   Stop 0x00000050 (0xBEBEE9F8 0x0000000 0x0000000 0x00000002)

   STOP 0x00000050 (0xf15ca000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)

   STOP 0x00000050 (0xffff0000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)

NOTE: The parameter values may be different on your computer, but a memory dump
file analysis indicates it is based in Vsapint.sys.

The STOP 0x50 error message may be displayed after you manually perform a virus
scan on the computer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if a Trend Micro antivirus program is installed on the
computer, and there is an issue with the Trend Micro Vsapint.sys driver file and
the Tmfilter.sys driver file.

This behavior has been reported to occur with Trend Micro ServerProtect for
Windows NT Server 5.31.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, remove or deactivate the Trend Micro antivirus program to
verify that the antivirus program is the cause of the STOP error message
described in the "Symptoms" section of this article, and then contact Trend
Micro for more information about how to resolve this issue or to inquire about
the availability of an update.
