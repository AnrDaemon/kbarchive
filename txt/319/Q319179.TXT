TITLE   :PRB: Starting IIS MMC to Retrieve Directory Properties Is Slow
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Internet Information Services (IIS) Microsoft Management
Console (MMC) or attempt to use Explorer.exe to retrieve properties on any
directory, this operation may be excessively slow.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the PHP hypertext preprocessor (Php4isapi.dll) is
installed as an Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) filter
in IIS. PHP is loaded as an ISAPI filter in IIS. The version of PHP that
exhibits this problem is 4.1.0. Php4isapi.dll does not contain file version
information. The following is the internal time stamp of the version of
Php4isapi.dll that exhibits this behavior:

   Tue Dec 11 15:24:42 2001

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, remove the ISAPI filter (Php4isapi.dll).

For information about how to use the PHP executable program instead, browse to
the following Web site:

   http://www.php.net

MORE INFORMATION
================

The IIS MMC and Explorer.exe have threads waiting on the inetinfo process.
Inetinfo attempts to close a metabase handle, but one of its threads stops
responding (hangs) when it attempts to notify all of the sinks registered for
metabase close notifications.

Explorer.exe is affected because it attempts to load W3ext.dll, the IIS shell
extension.
