KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms120 kbsms120bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Distribution Manager may generate the following log entries repeatedly after you
remove a lower-level site in your Systems Management Server (SMS) hierarchy:

   ~Processing incoming file C:\SMS\inboxes\distmgr.box\INCOMING\RD5L85BW.PKG.
   ~Updated replicated package info for package TOP00001
   ~No changed detected for package server
   ["Display=\\MOMDC\"]MSWNET:["SMS_SITE=BOT"]\\MOMDC\ for package TOP00001, no
   need to update
   ~SQL Err #10007> General SQL Server error: Check messages from the SQL
   Server.~
   ~SQL Msg #99901> This SiteCode (SEC) does not exist in the parent table,
   Sites.~
   ~Cannot update the package server
   ["Display=\\NTSERVER\"]MSWNET:["SMS_SITE=SEC"]\\NTSERVER\ for package
   TOP00001, error = 3

CAUSE
=====

If you remove a site (typically, a lower-level site from a hierarchy with three
or four tiers) from your hierarchy, package updates may be in transit down the
hierarchy. These packages were initiated from the central site before the
central site became aware that a site was deleted. These package updates refer
to distribution points on the nonexistent site. Distribution Manager generates
the log entries that are listed in the "Symptoms" section and does not delete
the .pkg file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, install the hotfix that is included in Microsoft
Knowledge Base article Q324204. For additional information, click the article

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, manually remove the .pkg file that is listed in the
log. For example, the following log entry indicates that you must remove the
Rd5l85bw.pkg file:

   ~Processing incoming file C:\SMS\inboxes\distmgr.box\INCOMING\RD5L85BW.PKG

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Distribution Manager processes the files each time there is a file or folder
change to the SMS\Inboxes\Distmgr.box\Incoming folder.
