TITLE   :Streets and Trips 2002: Route Does Not Appear on the Pocket PC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Automap
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MapPoint 2002 
 - Microsoft Streets & Trips 2002, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to export a route from MapPoint or Streets & Trips to a Pocket
PC, the program exports the map but not the route information.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, save the route as a Web page, and then export that
Web page to the Pocket PC. To do this, follow these steps.

Part 1: Save the Map and Route Information as a Web Page
--------------------------------------------------------

1. In MapPoint or Streets & Trips, open or create the route that you want to
   export.

2. On the map, zoom in or out so that the whole route appears on the screen.

   NOTE: The exported version will contain only the portion of the map that
   appears on the screen in MapPoint or Streets & Trips. The exported
   version will also contain any pushpins in the visible area.

3. On the File menu, click "Save as Web Page".

4. In the Title box, type an appropriate name for the route.

5. Click the Browse button next to the "Save as File name" box, locate the
   "Pocket_PC My Documents" folder, and then click Save.

6. Click OK.

   An .htm file and a folder of the same name are automatically saved.

7. Quit MapPoint or Streets & Trips.

Part 2: Export the Map to the Pocket PC
---------------------------------------

1. Establish a connection between your desktop computer and the Pocket PC.

2. Use ActiveSync to copy the map and folder from your desktop computer to the
   My Documents folder on your Pocket PC.

   Note: If you saved the file in the Pocket_PC My Documents folder in part 1,
   step 5, and have ActiveSync configured to synchronize files, the map is
   automatically exported to the Pocket PC.

3. When the synchronization process is complete, remove the Pocket PC from the
   cradle.

4. On the Pocket PC, tap Start, point to Programs, and then tap File Explorer.

   The My Documents folder opens.

5. Tap the .htm file of the route that you exported.

   Internet Explorer for the Pocket PC opens, and you can now view the map and
   the route information on the Web page in Internet Explorer.

NOTE: If the map fits the screen, it may be too small to be of practical help. To
make the map larger, tap to clear the "Fit to Screen" check box on the View
menu. In this view, you must scroll to see the whole map.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For versatility, you may want to view the map as a Web page to see the route
information and then switch to Pocket Streets to view a larger map and to use
the program's functionality (such as locating addresses, intersections, and
points of interest).
