TITLE   :The Web Proxy Service Stops Responding
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::2.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Proxy Server version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade your computer to Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0 and you
reinstall Proxy Server, or after you install Proxy Server on a computer that is
running a "clean" installation of IIS 4.0, you may receive the following error
messages:

   Event Viewer: Event 127 Web Proxy Service failed to initialize.

In the administration tool, you receive the following error message:

   IIS is improperly installed. You will need to reinstall.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because when you upgrade your computer from IIS 3.0 to
IIS 4.0 and Proxy Server 2.0 is installed, you need to reinstall the W3proxy.dll
file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior:

1. In IIS, click the ISAPI Filters tab in the Master dialog box, and then remove
   the W3proxy.dll file.

2. In the Default Web Site Properties dialog box, click the ISAPI Filters tab,
   and then manually add the W3proxy.dll file.

3. Stop and restart the World Wide Web (WWW) service.
