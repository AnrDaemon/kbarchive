SUMMARY
=======

This article describes some of the issues that you may encounter when you play a
multiplayer game of Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator: WWII Europe Series.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following issues can occur when you play a multiplayer game of Combat Flight
Simulator:

 - Symptom: When you attempt to start an Internet multiplayer game of Combat
   Flight Simulator, the game may stop responding (hang).

   Cause: This behavior can occur if you do not connect to the Internet by using
   Dial-Up Networking before you start Combat Flight Simulator in Full Screen
   mode.

   Resolution: To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:

    - Press ALT+ENTER to play the game inside a window before you start an
      Internet multiplayer game.

    - Start your Internet connection before you start Combat Flight Simulator.

 - Symptom: When you play a multiplayer game of Combat Flight Simulator, some
   aircraft may appear to fly through buildings or terrain features.

   Cause: This behavior can occur if either of the following conditions is true:

    - A player configured a different level of dynamic scenery or scenery
      complexity than the rest of the players.

    - A player installed a different scenery file than the rest of the players.

 - Symptom: If you attempt to transmit visual models of other players' converted
   aircraft, you may be disconnected from the game or you may experience other
   erratic behavior.

   Cause: This behavior can occur if you use a modem connection to connect to the
   Combat Flight Simulator game.

   NOTE:If the host of a multiplayer game selects the Restrict Aircraft option,
   you cannot fly any imported or converted aircraft during that game.

   This includes the Sopwith Camel, which is an imported Microsoft Flight
   Simulator 98 aircraft.

 - When you play a Squadron game in Combat Flight Simulator, you can see your
   team's score at the bottom of the Heads-Up Display (HUD).

   If you want to see your individual score, press the D key.

   NOTE: When you press the D key, your aircraft is put in a suspended state
   until you press the D key again.
