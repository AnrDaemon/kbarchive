PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97; winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word8 word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a Word document containing text in text boxes on a
Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printer, the document print file may be very large and
the document prints slowly.

CAUSE
=====

This is a known problem with the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printer drivers
shipped with Microsoft Windows NT 4.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, download and install the latest Hewlett-Packard
LaserJet printer driver available for your printer. To download the latest
Hewlett-Packard printer driver, please visit the following Hewlett-Packard Web

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you print using a Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printer driver, font information
for the text is usually downloaded to the printer. However, the shipped
Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printer drivers cannot understand a text box, so the
printer driver converts it to a bitmap. The bitmap causes the increased file
size and the slower than normal printing of the document.
