SUMMARY
=======

The Ju 87 Stuka aircraft is classified as a fighter in Combat Flight Simulator
missions, even though it is actually a dive-bomber, because the flight model of
the Ju 87 Stuka more closely resembles that of a fighter than that of a bomber.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Combat Flight Simulator, a computer-piloted Ju 87 Stuka aircraft selects a
ground target, dives on the target, and bombs it. After the Ju 87 Stuka has
destroyed the first target, it selects a new target.

A Ju 87 Stuka drops one bomb per pass, and then uses guns to continue attacking
ground targets. After a Stuka destroys all available ground targets, it engages
any available air targets.

The Ju 87 Stuka can also take evasive action when it is under fire.
