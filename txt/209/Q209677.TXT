======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word 97, when you open a Microsoft Word 2000 document [or a Word
2000 document saved in "Rich Text Format (*.rtf)"] that contains shading, the
shading does not appear as it does in Word 2000.

For example, if you have paragraphs shaded with 5 percent, 10 percent, or 12.5
percent gray shading in Word 2000, they appear unshaded (white) when the file is
opened in Word 97.


CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because of the different ways that the two versions of Word
handle color palettes. For example, Word 2000 supports 24-bit RGB color, but
Word 97 supports 16-bit color and has a limit of 50 RGB colors.

This means that colors that are similar to each other in Word 2000 are translated
(converted) to a single color in Word 97.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you are sharing your documents with others who use Microsoft Word 97 for
Windows, try eliminating gradient fills and use solid background or fill colors.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following table shows how the pre-defined shading in a Word 2000
document that was saved as either "Word Document (*.doc)" or "Rich
Text Format (*.rtf)" converts when you open the document in Microsoft
Word 97 for Windows.
