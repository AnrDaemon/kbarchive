TITLE   :Err Msg: "Message too large" When Sending Attachments Smaller Th
PRODUCT :The Microsoft Network
PROD/VER::6.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network version 6.1 
 - The Microsoft Network Version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When sending attachments through e-mail in MSN Explorer, you may get the error
message "Message too large", even though the size of the attachment is less than
the 1.5 MB limit. If the total size of the message is greater than 1.5 MB, you
will not be able to send the message.

CAUSE
=====

This can be caused by either of two factors:

 - The size of the attachment--when added to the size of the body of the message
   along with any other attachments--is over 1.5 MB. In this case, the error
   message is appropriate.

 - A known issue with the way MSN Explorer encodes e-mail messages can cause
   this issue. This encoding can result in an increase in the size of the
   message.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the total size of the message is less than 1.5 MB, you may be able to send
the message through the Hotmail Web site. Hotmail encodes the message after
checking the message size, so you may be able to send messages with Hotmail that
will not send via MSN Explorer may be permitted.

To send a message from the Hotmail Web site

 - Go to http://www.hotmail.com, sign in to your account (remembering to specify
   msn.com or hotmail.com in the drop-down box provided), and click the Compose
   tab at the top.
