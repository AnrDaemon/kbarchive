======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply the hotfix that is described in Microsoft Knowledge Base article
Q266712 on your Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 primary site server, users
of the SMS Administrator console may be unable to enumerate SMS objects such as
collections.

This problem can occur regardless of whether the SMS provider (either on the SMS
site server or on Microsoft SQL Server) is installed on a member server or a
domain controller. Before you applied the hotfix, users could successfully
inherit permissions that were assigned to the default domain local or default
local computer groups. Examples of the default local groups involved include the
Administrators and Power Users groups.

   Q266712 SMS: Security Based on Global Groups Fails in Windows 2000 Domains


CAUSE
=====

When the SMS provider enumerates a user's group membership, it returns the
default groups as "BUILTIN." For example, if you assign permissions to the
Domain1\Administrators group in SMS Security and then log on as a member of that
group, the SMS provider interprets the group membership as
BUILTIN\Administrators; you would not receive the assigned permissions.

Note that custom user groups that are created by the administrator are not
"BUILTIN," and do not experience this problem.

WORKAROUND
==========

When you define permissions for default (built-in) local groups in the SMS
Administrator console, specify "BUILTIN" instead of the domain or computer name.
For example, specify "BUILTIN\Administrators" in the SMS User Wizard.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
