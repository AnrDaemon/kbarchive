TITLE   :XCON: MTA Stops with Large IMCData Archive Folders
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbExchange550

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If there are large Archive folders in the IMCData\In and IMCData\Out folders,
the Exchange Server Message Transfer Agent (MTA) service may shut down.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when disk space is depleted. The MTA service needs disk
space to run.

The Archive folders in IMCData\In and IMCData\Out rapidly consume disk space when
diagnostics logging is set to archive messages. Additionally, if the Internet
Mail Service (IMS) does not successfully convert messages, IMS places the
unconverted messages in one of the appropriate Archive folders.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, start Windows Explorer, and then delete the archived
messages.

To prevent recurrence of this behavior, turn off message archiving:

1. In Exchange Administrator, open the Internet Mail Service Properties dialog
   box.

2. Click the Diagnostics Logging tab.

3. Click Message Archival, click None, and then click OK.
