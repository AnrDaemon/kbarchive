SUMMARY
=======

Participants must include all regional data, including country, region, and zip,
in their flexible registration pages.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you create a flexible registration page, if regional information (such as
country, region, or postal code) is needed, all of the information must be
available together on a registration page. It is not possible to only have one
entry or a combination of two on the registration page.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
