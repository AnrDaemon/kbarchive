KEYWORDS:kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click a Web link in Microsoft Bookshelf, your browser is redirected to
a Microsoft Encarta Web site that contains links to Encarta.msn.com sites and
the following message:

   web links

   We're sorry! This Internet resource is no longer available.

As a result, you cannot connect to a Web site when you click the Web link for
that site in Bookshelf.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Bookshelf Web site, http://bookshelf.msn.com, is
no longer available. Bookshelf has been replaced by Encarta World English
Dictionary and other Encarta reference products and services such as Microsoft
Encarta Encyclopedia Standard, Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia Deluxe, Microsoft
Encarta Reference Suite, Microsoft Encarta Online, and Microsoft Encarta Online
Deluxe.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, copy the Web address of the link from the
Bookshelf web links page to the Address bar of your browser, and then use your
browser to connect to the Web site. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the web links page in Microsoft Bookshelf, select the link of the Web site
   that you want to visit, right-click your selection, and then click Copy.

2. Start Microsoft Internet Explorer, right-click anywhere in the Address bar,
   and then click Paste.

3. Press the ENTER key to connect to the Web site.
