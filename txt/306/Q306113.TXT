TITLE   :PRB: Temp Folder with System Attribute Causes Errors in VFP

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to save a form in step 4 of the Form Wizard, the following error
may appear:

   File C:\foxtest\<filename>.tmp does not exist. Error: 1
   File C:\foxtest\<filename>.tmp does not exist.
   Method: Formwizengine1.form1.SaveAs
   Error: 0

CAUSE
=====

The folder that Visual FoxPro uses to store its temporary files has the System
attribute applied to it.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use one of the following workarounds:

 - From an MS-DOS command prompt, use the ATTRIB command to remove the System
   attribute for the folder:

   " ATTRIB -S c:\temp " (without the quotation marks)

   Substitute the name of your Visual FoxPro temporary files folder for "temp" in
   the example. Note that Windows Explorer does not offer the option to change
   the System attribute from its interface.

 - Direct the Visual FoxPro temporary files to another folder that does not have
   the System attribute set.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Using the MS-DOS ATTRIB command, set the System attribute for the Visual
   FoxPro temporary files folder. For example, the syntax for a folder called
   "temp" on drive C would be as follows:

   " ATTRIB +S c:\temp " (without the quotation marks)

   NOTE: To determine the location of the Visual FoxPro temporary files folder,
   use the SYS(2023) function.

2. If Visual FoxPro is running, close it and then restart it.

3. Start the Form Wizard, choose a table, and accept all the defaults in each
   step.

4. When you reach step 4, click Finish.
