TITLE   :Server Hangs Before Logon Screen After Uninstalling the SRP
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a Windows NT 4.0-based computer with the System Key (Syskey.exe)
functionality enabled, the computer may stop responding (hang) before the logon
screen is displayed. This problem may occur after you uninstall certain hotfixes
or the Windows NT 4.0 post-Service Pack 6a (SP6a) Security Rollup Package (SRP).

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs if the Samsrv.dll or Lsasrv.dll file (or both) was removed.
These files need to remain installed on the computer.

SP6a. Replace the SP6a versions of the Samsrv.dll and Lsasrv.dll files with the
hotfixed or Windows NT 4.0 post-SP6a SRP versions.
