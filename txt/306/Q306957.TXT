SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Exchange Server, when you attempt to send Simple Mail Transport
Protocol (SMTP) mail by using Collaborative Data Objects for NTS (CDONTS) with
Active Server Pages (ASP), the mail may remain in the Exchange Server or
Internet Information Server (IIS) pickup folder instead of being delivered.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this behavior, check the values of the relevant registry settings, and
then make sure that your anonymous Web account on the Imcdata folder has Add
permissions. Follow these steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the Active Messaging Use Exchange value under the following key in the
   registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Active Messaging Use Exchange
   = 0x00000001 (1)

This key indicates that Active Messaging programs should use Exchange Server.

3. Make sure that the data for this value is as shown. If it does not, correct
   the data.

4. Locate the RootDir value under the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters\RootDir
   = C:\exchsrvr\imcdata

This key shows the location of the Exchange Server IMC Pickup folder. This value
depends on the specific configuration.

5. Write down the location of the Imcdata folder.

6. Quit Registry Editor.

7. In Windows Explorer, go to the \Exchsrvr\Imcdata\Pickup folder.

8. Right-click the folder, and then click Properties.

9. Click the Security tab, and then click Permissions.

10. In the Directory Permissions dialog box, add your anonymous Web account if
   it is not already listed. Unless you configure it otherwise, this account is
   listed as <ComputerName\IUSR_ComputerName>.

11. Give the anonymous Web account Add permissions
