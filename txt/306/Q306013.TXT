SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to use Microsoft FrontPage to import, edit, and
publish a Web site created in Microsoft Publisher 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Publisher 2000, you can create Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) pages, but
you cannot open and edit the HTML pages in Publisher after they are created. If
you want to use Publisher to create and publish a Web site, it is recommended
that you save a copy of your document as a publication file (.pub). In this way,
if you want to make any changes to your Web site, you can edit the .pub file,
save it as a new HTML document, and then republish it in Publisher. Or, you can
import your publication into FrontPage and then use FrontPage to edit your pages
and publish your Web site. You may want to do this if you want to add the many
available FrontPage features and formatting options to your Web pages.

To import your Web publication into FrontPage and then edit and publish your Web
site, follow the steps in the "Save Your Publication in HTML Format" and "Import
Your Web Site into FrontPage" sections of this article.

Save Your Publication in HTML Format
------------------------------------

When you create a publication in Publisher, it is saved with a .pub file
extension. Before you import your publication into FrontPage, you must first
save (publish) it in HTML format. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Start Publisher, and then open your publication.

2. On the File menu, click "Save as Web Page".

3. In the "Save as Web Page" dialog box, accept the default Publish folder that
   Publisher creates when you publish (save) your publication in HTML format, or
   specify another folder and location on your hard disk in which to save the
   HTML files, and then click OK.

   The Web site created from your publication is now published to the folder that
   you specified on your hard disk. The home page file name is Index.html.

4. Quit Publisher.

Import Your Web Site into FrontPage
-----------------------------------

1. Start FrontPage.

2. Do one of the following:

    - If you are using FrontPage 2000, point to New on the File menu, and then
      click Web.

      -or-

    - If you are using FrontPage 2002, point to New on the File menu, and then
      click "Page or Web".

3. In the New dialog box (in FrontPage 2000) or the "New Page or Web" task pane
   (in FrontPage 2002), click Empty Web, and then click OK.

4. On the File menu, click Import, and then click Add Folder.

5. Do one of the following:

    - If you are using FrontPage 2000, locate the folder containing your HTML
      files in the "Browse for Folder" dialog box, and then click OK.

      -or-

    - If you are using FrontPage 2002, locate the folder containing your HTML
      files in the File Open dialog box, and then click Open.

The contents of the folder are listed in the Import dialog box.

6. Click OK.

   The folder containing your HTML files is listed in the Folder List pane in
   your new Web.

7. Click the plus sign (+) next to the folder to expand it and view its
   contents.

8. Drag the Index.html file from the folder to the root of your Web.

9. Double-click a Web page in the Folder List pane to edit the page.
