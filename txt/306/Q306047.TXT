TITLE   :ENC2002: Status Bar at 100% When Copying to Hard Drive
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta Reference Library 2002 - DVD Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Encarta Reference Library 2002 - DVD Edition allows you to copy the
product to the hard drive before you install it. During this process, the
installation status bar moves to 100% (the full position), and stays there while
files are being copied. That is, the installation status bar is at 100%,
although the installation is not complete yet.

Because the status bar does not show you how the installation is proceeding, the
installation process may appear to stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

The installation process may appear to stop responding, but it is actually still
copying files to the hard drive. Some files may take several minutes to copy,
depending on the speed of your DVD-ROM drive.

NOTE: Do not quit Setup until it is complete.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This type of installation may take 30 minutes or longer. To see how the
installation is progressing, look at the file names, which change as each file
is copied.

Additional query words: multi multi-media media mm
