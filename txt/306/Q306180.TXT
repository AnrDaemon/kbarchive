The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When it connects to your Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0 server, a browser
that needs to provide a client certificate may not show client certificates that
originate from a certain Certification Authority. This may occur even after you
have imported the Certification Authority root certificate into the IIS 4.0
server's Trusted Root Certification Authorities certificate store.

CAUSE
=====

The IIS 4.0 server to which you are connecting does not have the Certificate
Authority's root certificate installed correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow these steps to reinstall the Certificate
Authority's root certificate on the IIS computer:

1. On the IIS server, start Microsoft Internet Explorer.

2. On the Tools menu, click Internet Options.

3. On the Content tab, click Certificates.

4. Click the Trusted Root Certification Authorities tab, and remove any
   certificates that point to the Certificate Authority that issued the client
   certificates. To do this, select the certificate that you want to remove,
   click Remove, and then click Yes for each dialog box that you receive.

5. Click Close, then click OK to clear any remaining dialog boxes.

6. Obtain a copy of the Certificate Authority root certificate.
