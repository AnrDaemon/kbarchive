On page 41, in question 70-217.02.01.009, the correct answer should be A, not A
and B.

Change:
"Correct Answers: A and B

B. Correct: When you create a standard primary forward lookup zone, the New Zone
Wizard requires you to specify a name for the zone database filename. The zone
database filename defaults to the zone name with a .dns extension. If you are
migrating a standard primary forward lookup zone from another server, you must
first copy the zone database file to the systemroot\system32\dns folder on the
target server."

----------------------------------------------------------

On page 94, in question 70-217.03.04.002, the correct answer should be B, not D.

Change the answers to be:

"Correct Answers: B
...

B. Correct: Because you did not change any default settings on the Settings tab
of the My Documents Properties dialog box, the My Pictures folder reamins a
subfolder of My Documents. Therefore, My Pictures follows My Documents to the
redirection target specified on the Target tab of the My Documents Properties
dialog box, which is \\fs1\data\%username%. The path suggested in this answer
choice correctly shows the My Pictures folder as a subfolder of
\\fs1\data\%username%, which is the My Documents folder.
...

D. Incorrect: Folder Rediction does not create a subfolder called "My Documents"
under \\fs1\data\%username%. \\fs1\data\%username% is the redirected My
Documents folder. Therefore, the answers is incorrect.
