TITLE   :BUG: Num Lock Indicator Light Doesn't Light up in VFP Mac
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenvkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Microsoft Visual FoxPro for the Power Macintosh is running and has focus,
the Num Lock light does not light up and dim out as the Num Lock state is
toggled on and off by the user pressing the NUM LOCK key.

CAUSE
=====

The low-level handlers that provide this functionality in FoxPro 2.6 for the
Macintosh on 68K machines do not work on the Power Macintosh.


RESOLUTION
==========

The NUM LOCK key does set the Num Lock state correctly. This is indicated on the
Visual FoxPro status bar by the term "NUM" appearing on the status bar when the
Num Lock state is on, and the term "NUM" disappearing from the status bar.

To turn the Visual FoxPro status bar on, enter the following in the Command
window:

      SET STATUS BAR ON

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To reproduce the problem, set or clear the Num Lock on the keyboard with the NUM
LOCK key. Note that the Num Lock indicator light does not light up.
