-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fury 3 for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Microsoft Fury3 icon is double-clicked on twice in rapid succession,
Fury3 may launch two instances of the program. This will result in significant
performance degradation, and many error messages.

RESOLUTION
==========

If two instances of Fury3 are running, close one instance of the program. There
is no need to quit both instances and re-launch the program. This should cause
the error messages caused my multiple instances of Fury3 running simultaneously
to cease.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because of the short lag between double-clicking on the Fury3 program icon and
the launching of the program, some users may occasionally double-click the
program icon twice, resulting in Fury3 being launched twice. The
memory-intensive nature of the program is likely to cause significant
performance degradation, and the errors:

   Invalid Page Fault

   and

   Insufficient memory
