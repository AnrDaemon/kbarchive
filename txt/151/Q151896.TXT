TITLE   :Automap Streets: Only One Go To Pointer to City Name Allowed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Automap

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Automap Streets for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Maps only show one Go To pointer for city names, but allow multiple pointers for
addresses.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Automap Streets for
Windows, version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Streets for Windows Streets allows you to look up street addresses, cities, zip
codes and other natural features with the Go To command.

If you enter a street address, Automap Streets displays a pointer consisting of
the address inside a blue box at its proper location on the map. If you enter
the name of a city, Automap Streets displays a pointer consisting of the city
name inside a blue box at the location of the city center.

Although you can display pointers to multiple street addresses on the same map,
this is not true for city names. Only one pointer to a city name can be
displayed on the map. If you enter a second city name, the pointer to the first
city name disappears.
