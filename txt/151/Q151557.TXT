======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for Windows 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q194276.

SUMMARY
=======

FrontPage does not include File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Gopher, Telnet, or Wide
Area Information Service (WAIS) protocol services (although these protocols are
included in the drop-down menus for creating links in FrontPage Editor). When
you select the link in a browser or follow it in FrontPage Editor, it may not be
resolved or it may generate an error message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

FTP, Gopher, Telnet and WAIS servers are available through several third- party
vendors. FTP and Gopher services can also be implemented through Microsoft
Internet Information Server (IIS). For implementation and configuration of IIS,
please consult the Readme file included with IIS.

The Microsoft Internet Information Server can be obtained from the Microsoft
World Wide Web site at

   http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/products

The Microsoft Internet Information Server is not supported by FrontPage at this
time; FTP and Gopher services, however, can be used in conjunction with
FrontPage.

The third-party products discussed in this article are manufactured by vendors
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.
