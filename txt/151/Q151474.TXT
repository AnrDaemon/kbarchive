SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Service Pack 4 (SP4) for Windows NT 3.51, if you try to save a
Word 95 document to a NetWare file server that has the OS/2 Name Space service,
the following error message appears:

   The disk is full or too many files are open

This error will happen only if the FavourLongNames entry is enabled in the
registry on the Windows NT computer.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run the Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

   \System\CurrentControlSet\Services\NWRDR\parameters

3. Disable the FavourLongNames entry by setting this data to zero.

-OR-

An alternative workaround is to upgrade to Office95B
