STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual SourceSafe
5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Natural Keyboard has a special key built into the keyboard that
produces the same behavior as clicking the right-mouse button. In Visual
SourceSafe, pressing the right-mouse button causes various context sensitive
menus to appear. However, pressing the special secondary-mouse CLICK key on the
Microsoft Natural Keyboard does not invoke the context sensitive menus in Visual
SourceSafe.
