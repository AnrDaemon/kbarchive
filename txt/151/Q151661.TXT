As part of troubleshooting Encarta World Atlas, it may be necessary to turn off
Cosmo. The following procedure describes how to disable Cosmo in the Windows 95
Registry if Encarta World Atlas will not start.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk. The registry is a system-wide database used for storing
Windows 95 software and hardware configuration settings.

1. Click the Start button, and then click Run.

2. Type the following and click OK:

   "regedit" (without the quotation marks)

3. When the Registry Editor appears, double-click the HKEY_CURRENT_USER folder.

4. Double-click the Software folder, and then the Microsoft folder.

5. Double-click the Microsoft Reference folder, then the Encarta World Atlas
   folder and then the Option folder.

NOTE: Inside this folder there should be an item called Defaults which is a text
string of default settings for Encarta World Atlas. Each entry is follow by a
greater than (>) or a less than (<) sign to identify whether or not it is
active. If all options are active then all entries on this line should be
followed by greater than signs.

1. Double-click Defaults to edit the item.

2. Click after the Cosmo entry, delete the greater than (>) sign and replace
   it with a less than (<) sign.

3. Click OK

The text string will now update to show the new setting and you will be able to
start Encarta World Atlas without Cosmo.
