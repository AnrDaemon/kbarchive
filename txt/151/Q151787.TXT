TITLE   :XCLN: Error Deleting Schedule+ Meeting Response
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Inbox Client 
 - Microsoft Windows Messaging 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After upgrading the Windows 95 Messaging client using the Exupdusa.exe update
available from http://www.msdn.microsoft.com or when using the Windows Messaging
client shipped with Windows NT 4.0, deleting a Schedule+ Meeting Response from
within the clients may return the following error message:

   Your message could not be deleted. An error occurred.

The meeting response will have actually been deleted. The error message is
erroneous. However, the error message can be confusing. In the case where
additional meeting requests are automatically displayed according to action
specified by opening the Tools menu, selecting the Options command, clicking the
Read tab, and setting the After Moving or Deleting an Open Item listbox, it
becomes unclear which particular message the error refers to.


WORKAROUND
==========

Upgrade the Windows Messaging client with the Windows Messaging System
components that ship with Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Windows Messaging client. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
