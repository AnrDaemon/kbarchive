SUMMARY

A set of log files is created in the \Mdbdata subdirectory of Microsoft Exchange
Server when you set Sending and Delivering diagnostics logging for either the
private and public information stores to Maximum.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The log files have the following format:

   Dlv.log
   Snd.log
   Dlvxxxxx.log
   Sndxxxxx.log

where xxxxx starts with 00001 and is incremented as necessary. The Dlv.log and
Snd.log are the last logs created. These logs contain XAPI properties as
manipulated between the MTA and the store. These logs are not meant to be used
by mail system administrators and are only useful for troubleshooting and when
requested by Microsoft support or development personnel.

It is safe to delete these log files at any time

WARNING: The store transaction logs names have the following format: Edb.log,
Edb00000.log. When you delete the trace logs, be careful not to delete any
transaction logs or you may lose the ability to recover a full store if a backup
needs to be restored.
