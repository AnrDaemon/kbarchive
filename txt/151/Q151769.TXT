The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 5.0a 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you change the default options for Microsoft Visual FoxPro and you have the
status bar turned off, Visual FoxPro notifies you that the Default Options were
saved in a Visual FoxPro wait window. A random character in the "Default Options
Saved" wait window appears after the <Set as Default> button is pressed in
the Tools/Options dialog.

The messages that appear in the Visual FoxPro wait windows are:

 - Saving Options

-and=

 - #Default Options Saved

   where # is a garbage character that appears before the word "Default".

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Problem

1. In the Command Window, type "SET STATUS BAR OFF" (without the quotation
   marks) and press the ENTER key.

2. On the Tools menu, select Options.

3. Change an option, and click the Set as Default button.

This bug is a visual problem and does not affect the functionality of Visual
FoxPro in any way.
