SUMMARY
=======

User Manager for Domains does not allow administrators to generate a list of
user accounts, and Net user /domain will only pull user accounts from the domain
that the computer account is located in. You can generate a list of user
accounts from domains (trusted) other than the domain your computer has an
account in by using the Resource Kit utility addusers.exe.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the command line

   addusers \\servername /d filename.txt

(where servername is the name of the primary domain controller), administrators
can generate a list of users in domains other than their own; this list is
generated into a text file. This file will also contain information such as the
profile, home directory, and scripts.
