The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you name your Windows NT domain "E" or any single letter that comes after E
in the alphabet, your domain will be listed twice in the File Manager browse
list. When selected to list resources, one entry will work correctly. The other
will display error 6118: The list of servers is not available.

Other servers on the network may also have difficulty finding the primary domain
controller.

Under Windows 95 Explorer, the second entry will be displayed with three periods
after it.


RESOLUTION
==========

Do not use a single letter for your domain name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
