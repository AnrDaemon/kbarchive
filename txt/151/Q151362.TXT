======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Windows NT Resource Kit utility Remote Command Service (RCMD),
you may receive one of the following error messages:

   Failed to connect to <\\servername>, Error = 1326

-or-

   Failed to connect to <\\IP address>, Error = 1326

CAUSE
=====

The above error indicates that there has been a logon failure to the server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, first establish a secure channel to the server by
connecting to the Inter-Process Communication share (IPC$) by typing the
following at a command prompt and pressing ENTER:

   "net use \\<servername>\ipc$ /user:<domain>\<username>"
   (without the quotation marks)

In the above example, <servername> is the server on which you are
attempting to run a command remotely. <Domain>\<username> must be a
user account that has administrative rights on the target server.

For more information on RCMD, see the following article in the Microsoft
