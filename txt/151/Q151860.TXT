TITLE   :STOP 0x0A While Writing to the Middle of a Cached File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Under heavy file I/O a computer running Windows NT may blue screen with The
following Stop error in CcFastCopyWrite.

   Stop 0x0000000A (0xC8663000, 0x00000002, 0x00000001, 0x80101A6C)

CAUSE
=====

When an application writes data to the middle of a file, Cache Manager does not
check this case properly against a write beyond the end of the file. For this to
happen both the end of the file and the current write location need to be in the
cache plus there needs to be a special layout of cache memory.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
