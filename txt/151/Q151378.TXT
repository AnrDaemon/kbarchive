The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

CStatic::SetBitmap() does not display the bitmap correctly on a picture control
in Windows NT 3.51 if the picture control is subclassed.

This problem is restricted to Windows NT 3.51 and does not appear on Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not subclass the picture control either directly, by using SubClassWindow()
or SubClassDlgItem(), or indirectly, by associating a CStatic control variable
with it. Instead, call SetBitmap() using a pointer to the picture holder
obtained by calling GetDlgItem()

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Embed a picture control on a dialog, form view, or property page using the
resource editor, and associate it with a bitmap type. Change the ID from
IDC_STATIC to something else. Associating the picture control with a bitmap ID
is optional. Using Class Wizard, associate a CStatic control variable with this
picture control. Note that when you try to display a bitmap or change the old
bitmap on the picture holder using CStatic::SetBitmap(), the new bitmap is not
displayed.

Sample Code
-----------

      // IDC_PICHOLD is the picture holder's ID
      ((CStatic*)GetDlgItem(IDC_PICHOLD))->SetBitmap(/* handle to bitmap */);
