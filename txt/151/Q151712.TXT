SUMMARY
=======

From time to time, you may need to synchronize a computer's time with that of
another computer while lacking physical access to one or both computers. Using
the AT Command Scheduler, you can issue a NET TIME command to the remote
computer(s).

The following example shows how to synchronize the time for ComputerA with
ComputerB in a situation where the user only has physical access to ComputerC.

1. From ComputerC, open a command prompt.

2. Type the following command:

   "AT \\ComputerA <HH:MM:SS> /INTERACTIVE "NET TIME \\ComputerB /SET /Y""
   (without the quotation marks)

   This schedules the NET TIME command to run the next time ComputerA gets to
   <HH:MM:SS>.

You can check the time on ComputerA by typing NET TIME \\COMPUTERA. This will
display the time on the remote machine (though it may be inaccurate, based on
ComputerA's time zone).

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

Q139453NET TIME Does Not Report Correct Remote Time in Windows NT

The above example requires that the user have administrative rights on all three
computers. In addition, the Scheduler service must be running on ComputerA and
ComputerC.
