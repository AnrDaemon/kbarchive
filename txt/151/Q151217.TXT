TITLE   :Password Substitution Is Not Available in SNASVCMG Mode
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11,2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Currently, SNA Server does not support password substitution on the SNA System
Services (SNASVCMG) mode, even though strict SNA implementations require that
all sessions between two LUs have the same conversation-level security
indicators. If the data modes support password substitution then the service
modes should support password substitution as well.

RESOLUTION
==========

Because strict SNA implementations require that all sessions between two LUs
support the same conversation level security indicators, a hotfix is available
to support this feature.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server for Windows
NT, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, and 2.11.sp1. This problem was corrected in the
latest Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
