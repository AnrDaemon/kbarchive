TITLE   :SMS: Remote Control with 16 Colors Generates More Traffic
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbtshoot kbsmsAdmin smsadmin smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If either the computer running the Systems Management Server Administrator or
the client involved in a remote control session is configured to use a 16-color
video mode, the network traffic generated will actually be greater than a remote
control session involving systems using higher color video modes. Note that this
also applies to Microsoft Japanese Systems Management Server version 1.1.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, avoid using 16-color mode on both the computer
running the Systems Management Server Administrator and the client being
controlled remotely.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When either the Systems Management Server Administrator Console or a Systems
Management Server client computer are running in a video mode using 16 colors
(four bits per pixel, or bpp), a Remote Control session between them will
generate much more network traffic. This increased traffic results in slower
screen updates.

If one or both of these computers are running in other video color modes, such as
256 colors (8 bpp), 64 thousand colors (16 bpp), or 16.7 million colors (24
bpp), the amount of network traffic will actually be reduced. When both of the
computers are running 16 colors, the difference becomes tremendously
significant, in some cases increasing the amount of network traffic by 95
times.

NOTE: In Systems Management Server 1.1, Help Desk utilities only work on clients
running MS-DOS and Windows. This problem does not apply to clients running
Windows NT, the Macintosh operating system, or OS/2.
