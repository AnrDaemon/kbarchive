TITLE   :How to Re-create Default Icons Deleted from Desktop
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If the default icons are deleted from a Windows NT desktop, they can be
recreated with the Registry.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a desktop icon is deleted, the registry entry for that icon is also deleted
in one section of the Registry (details below). However, the icon information is
maintained elsewhere in the Registry (details below) and this information can be
copied back to the original location to restore the icons.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Use Regedit.exe to search the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID portion of the registry
   for the string associated with the icon you want to recreate.

2. Right-click on the 32-character number and choose Rename. With the ID number
   highlighted, press CTRL+INSERT to copy the text to the Clipboard.

3. Locate Hkey_local_machine\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion
   \explorer\desktop\namespace in the registry and choose Edit\Add Key.

4. Press SHIFT+INSERT to paste in the 32-character identifier.

5. In the right-hand pane of REGEDIT, double-click on the default icon and type
   the title to be associated with the desktop icon in the Value data field.

6. Log off to make the changes take effect.

This procedure works for these desktop icons:
