TITLE   :XADM: Simultaneous Move User Operations Freeze
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Administrator program may stop responding during a Move
User operation. The progress indicator may stop moving and the Administrator
program stop responding. Another instance of the Administrator program will also
fail to complete the Move User operation.

Attempts to stop the Store service will often fail when this problem occurs. No
related events appear in the event logs.

CAUSE
=====

These symptoms occur when multiple Move User operations are run simultaneously.
While the error is seen in the Administrator program, the actual error has
occurred in the Store process on the server. Move User threads in the store
become deadlocked and none can proceed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Run only a single instance of the Move User operation.

STATUS
======

version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
