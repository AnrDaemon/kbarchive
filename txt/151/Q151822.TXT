TITLE   :PRB: Visigenic Oracle Driver Case-Sensitive w/ Catalog API
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the 32-bit Visigenic Oracle driver version 2.0 and call any Catalog
API and provide the owner name and/or the table name in lowercase, you will get
a SQL_NO_DATA_FOUND on a SQLFetch. Existing ODBC applications such as Microsoft
Access fail to attach Oracle tables as they cannot get the catalog information
needed to attach the table.

(Note that as of 12/9/98, Visigenic has been acquired by INPRISE, Inc.)

CAUSE
=====

For the 2.0 Visigenic driver, SQLGetInfo for the InfoType SQL_IDENTIFIER_CASE is
SQL_IC_UPPER, which means that the identifiers in SQL are case-sensitive and are
stored in uppercase in the system catalog.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you are using Microsoft Access, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft
Visual Basic, or MSQuery, and if you are prompted with a logon dialog box, type
the logon name in uppercase. If you are using Basic code, then provide the logon
ID in upper case.

If you are calling the ODBC Catalog API, use uppercase for all the identifiers,
including the owner name. You may, however, pass a null pointer for the
identifiers, depending on your requirement.

Note that this problem is specific to calling the Catalog API and has nothing to
do with the Oracle server's case sensitivity.
