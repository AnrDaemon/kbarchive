TITLE   :BDC Promoted to PDC Lacks License Purchase History
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you promote a backup domain controller (BDC) to be the primary domain
controller (PDC), License Manager loses its purchase history. Products view (per
seat and per server) is set to 0 and Clients (per seat) is set to 0 licensed and
1 unlicensed.

If you restore the original primary domain controller, the License Manager
purchase history is regenerated.

CAUSE
=====

The Cpl.cfg file contains purchase history information. It does not get
replicated from the PDC to the BDC. When the BDC becomes the PDC it does not
have the purchase history.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make a copy of the old Cpl.cfg file and place it in system32 directory
(typically, c:\winnt35\system32) of the new PDC. This will keep the purchase
history intact.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5 and 3.51.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
