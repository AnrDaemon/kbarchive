-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 4.0, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

CToolBarCtrl styles such as CCS_ADJUSTABLE are ignored by CToolBar::Create(),
and do not have any affect on the CToolBar that is created.

The Common Control Toolbar controls styles that are ignored include
CCS_ADJUSTABLE, CCS_BOTTOM, CCS_NOHILITE, CCS_TOP, and the Toolbar styles
TBSTYLE_ALTDRAG, TBSTYLE_TOOLTIPS and TBSTYLE_WRAPABLE.

CAUSE
=====

CToolBar is an implementation of the Common Control Toolbar and requires
specific flags. Before calling CWnd::Create() to create the Toolbar control,
CToolBar removes all styles in the range of 0 to 0xFFFF. This includes all of
the CControlBar (CBRS_X) styles as well as the Common Control styles.

The following Common Control styles are then set:

   CCS_NOPARENTALIGN, CCS_NOMOVEY, CCS_NODIVIDER, and CCS_NORESIZE

RESOLUTION
==========

One solution is to use ModifyStyle in the handler for WM_NCCREATE to set the
styles needed.

CToolBarCtrl may also be used instead of CToolBar when modifying the toolbar
using the Common Control styles, but the CToolBarCtrl does not support all of
the functionality of CToolBar, such as docking, automatic CFrameWnd layout and
CmdUI updates. The CToolBarCtrl notifications arising due to these styles also
have to be handled.

It is possible to set the Common Control styles in CToolBar by deriving a class
from CToolBar and overriding the virtual function CToolBar::PreCreateWindow().
This may cause problems because some of the CCS_X styles have the same value as
some of the CBRS_X styles. For example, CBRS_FLYBY and CCS_ADJUSTABLE are both
0x0020L.
