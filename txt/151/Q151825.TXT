======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a CGI application that accesses a SQL Server or other database,
Internet Information Server (IIS) may return the following error:

   502 Gateway error

However, IIS can also return no information, and the Web browser will appear to
stop responding.

CAUSE
=====

When you access a data source with IIS, a System DSN must be used. This applies
for CGI applications and Internet Database Connector(IDC) files.

RESOLUTION
==========

To set up a System DSN:
-----------------------

1. In Control Panel, click the ODBC icon.

2. In the Data Sources dialog box, click the System DSN button. NOTE: This step
   is important because IIS only works with System DSN.

3. In the System DSN dialog box, click the Add button to display the Add Data
   Source dialog box.

4. In the Add Data Source dialog box, select the driver for the data source you
   are connecting to, and click OK.

5. Enter the data source name and the location of the database as needed
   (depending on which type of database you plan to access).

6. Click OK. NOTE: The System Data Sources dialog box is
   displayed and displays the name of the data source you created. Click Close.

7. The Data Sources dialog box is displayed. Click Close.
