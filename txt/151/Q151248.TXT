TITLE   :XCLN: URLs With Spaces are Truncated by Exchange Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a URL that points to a long filename, containing spaces, on the
server, the resulting hotlink created by the Microsoft Exchange client is
truncated.

CAUSE
=====

The client looks for a space to determine the end of the URL. When it comes upon
a space in the filename, it interprets this as the end of the filename.

RESOLUTION
==========

Find the associated 8.3 name of the file and send that filename in the URL.

For example, when you try to send a hot link to a file called Contents Page.htm:

   http://server/subdir/contents page.htm

use:

   http://server/subdir/conten~1.htm

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can find the 8.3 filename on Windows 95 by using the dir command from a
command prompt. On Windows NT, use the dir /x command.
