TITLE   :XADM: EcPropSize-MAPI_E_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY Reported by ISINTEG
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97; winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you import a large number of contacts into the Outlook Contacts folder,
the folder becomes unusable or inaccessible. The Outlook client may report
out-of-memory errors when you use the Contacts folder.

Also, when you run ISINTEG -FIX -PRI -VERBOSE against the private information
store, you may see error messages similar to the following:

   Starting test 2 of 24, 'Restriction Tables'

   Error: ecPropSize-MAPI_E_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY, Failed to open ptagSearchFIDs on
   fid-0001-000000FB07D8.

However, Isinteg.exe fails to correct the problem.

CAUSE
=====

By creating a separate search/restrict folder for each contact, the Outlook
client is creating a folder property larger that 32 KB. The Microsoft Exchange
information store does not check for or handle a folder property larger than 32
KB.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Information Store will be corrected to check for and handle folder
properties over 32 KB; this will prevent future occurrences of this problem.
Isinteg.exe will also be corrected to fix the folder property in information
stores that have already encountered this problem.
