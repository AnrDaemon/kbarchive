TITLE   :IIS Sends Image Map File Instead of Processing the Script
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you click a server-side image map, the browser downloads the image map file
instead of taking you to a link defined in the image map. Depending on which
browser you are using, it may display the map file or prompt you to save it to
disk.

CAUSE
=====

Given the following image map:

   rect (0,1) (170,53) http://server/file1.htm
   rect (264,26) (349,53) http://server/file2.htm
   rect (187,23) (264,53) http://server/file3.htm

If you click an area not defined by the coordinates the DEFAULT case should be
returned by the server. In this case, no DEFAULT case is defined. Internet
Information Server (IIS) sends the contents of the map file to the browser
client with the following header:

   Content-type: application/octet-stream

Depending on how you have the MIME type mapped in your browser, you will receive
different results. Some clients may give you an error about "unhandled file
type" while others will display the content as plain text.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Server version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
