TITLE   :MAC Volume Incorrectly Removed Before Last Client Session
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A Macintosh volume may be deleted while there are one or more clients that are
still connected and have open files. When you remove a Macintosh volume, the
Services for Macintosh server should queue the remove request until all client
sessions are closed or have disconnected because the session timed-out.

CAUSE
=====

Services for Macintosh is not properly delaying the removal of the volume until
after all client sessions have been closed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not remove a volume until all client sessions to that volume have properly
disconnected from the volume or have closed any open files. Open files can be
viewed using the MacFile control panel tool. Once all client files are closed,
any open sessions can be disconnected using the MacFile tool.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server versions 3.51
and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
