TITLE   :XADM: 4.0 Proxy Address Generator and Scandinavian Characters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add a new mailbox to a computer running Microsoft Exchange Server and
the name includes an extended character such as an "a" or an "o" with an umlaut,
the character is converted to ae or oe (respectively) in the X.400 and SMTP
proxy addresses. This also happens with the generation of the common name. This
is correct for German names but it is incorrect for Scandinavian names. To make
sense to Scandinavian users, these characters should instead be converted to a
and o.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

After the fix is applied, in generating proxy addresses, the mapping of the
extended characters will be based on the Microsoft Exchange Server locale, not
where the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program is running. However,
when generating the common name, the mapping will be based on the locale where
the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program is running.

The fix eliminates the unwanted character mapping. The following languages
(locales) trigger the conversion of extended characters in a way that makes
sense to Scandinavian users:

   Danish
   Faeroese
   Finnish
   Icelandic
   Norwegian
   Swedish
