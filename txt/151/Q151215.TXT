SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange PCMTA writes to both the Send.log and Recv.log for any
Microsoft Mail Postoffice (PO) it serves. These are the only text logs that the
PCMTA writes to. All diagnostic logging is kept in the Windows NT Event Viewer
on the computer where the PCMTA is running.

The PCMTA logs the .MAI hex number for both incoming and outgoing mail.

An example Recv.log:

DATE RECEIVED   SIZE  FROM                   TO
-------------   ----  ----                   --
05/17/96 09:39  1239  NETWORK/REMOTEPO/ADMIN NETWORK/LOCALPO/ADMIN        *
00000306

In this Recv.log file, 00000306 is the hex number for the incoming MAI file that
is being written to disk.

An example Sent.log:

DATE SENT       SIZE  SENDER                   TO
---------       ---  ------                    --
05/17/96 09:44  715  NETWORK/LOCALPO/Admin     NETWORK/REMOTEPO/Admin
0000030C 00000403

In this example, 0000030C is the hex number for the MAI file written to disk and
00000403 is the hex number for the target MAI file on the remote PO.
