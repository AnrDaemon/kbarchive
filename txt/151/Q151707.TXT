SUMMARY
=======

When you install both the MS Mail service and Microsoft Exchange Server service
in a Microsoft Exchange client for Windows and they reply to messages originated
by an MS Mail user, the reply address is determined by the Microsoft Exchange
client service that was first able to deliver the message back to MS Mail.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you reply to an MS Mail message using the Microsoft Exchange client, the
client service that will deliver that message is chosen by the delivery order.

The order can be modified by choosing Options from the Tools menu in the
Microsoft Exchange client, selecting the Delivery tab, and modifying the
delivery order.

If the first service listed in the order is the Microsoft Exchange Server
service, then messages to MS Mail addresses will be sent through the Microsoft
Exchange Server MS Mail Connector, thus making the reply address a Microsoft
Exchange proxy address. If the MS Mail service is listed first, then the reply
address will be the MS Mail address configured for the MS Mail service in the
Microsoft Exchange client.
