TITLE   :Auditing Stand-Alone Servers in a Windows NT Domain
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Audit Policy for your domain is set to audit File and Object Access Success
and Failure. You use File Manager to connect to a share on one of your Windows
NT servers. The server is a member of the domain but is not a domain controller.
You highlight a directory, click on Security, Auditing, select Events to Audit,
and Add Users and Groups. Clicking OK returns the following:

   Current audit policy does not have auditing turned on. Ask an Administrator
   to use User Manager to turn on auditing.

RESOLUTION
==========

Start User Manager for Domains, click User, Select Domain, and enter the
Server's name instead of a domain name. For instance, if you wish to audit
events on the stand-alone server \\SA_SERVER, type "\\SA_SERVER" (without the
quotes) in the Domain box. User Manager will display accounts database of
\\SA_SERVER. Proceed to set the Audit Policy for \\SA_SERVER.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Domain audit policies apply to domain controllers. Domain audit policies will
not automatically take effect on stand-alone Windows NT servers even though such
servers may be members of a domain. To establish audit policies on a stand-alone
server, User Manager must be focused on the server, not on the domain.
