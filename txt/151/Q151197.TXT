TITLE   :XCLN: Import of MMF May Create Duplicate Messages in Inbox
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you import a Microsoft Mail MMF to a Microsoft Exchange PST in a profile
that has only the MS Mail service installed, duplicate messages may be imported
to the Inbox.

CAUSE
=====

This will occur if the user had Inbox Shadowing turned on in an installation of
the 16 or 32 bit MS Mail client. Subsequent new messages do not duplicate.

RESOLUTION
==========

Prior to importing the MMF, turn off Inbox Shadowing using the following steps:

1. Open the MS Mail client.

2. From the Mail menu, open Options, then click the Server button.

3. Uncheck the box "Copy Inbox on Postoffice for Dialin Access".

4. Verify the Inbox has been synchronized.

5. Exit the MS Mail client.
