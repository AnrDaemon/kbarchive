-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSPRESS Mastering Microsoft Exchange Development ISBN 1-57231-337-4, version 1.0 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Add/Remove Programs tool in Windows 95 to remove a Complete
installation of Mastering Microsoft Exchange Development, not everything
installed by setup is removed. Add/Remove Programs does not remove the Med
directory or the directories below it including the Labs directory, the Lab
subdirectories, and the Lists directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed above. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you did a Complete installation, you can manually delete the Med directory
and the directories below it by using the following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and click Files or Folders.

2. Type the name of the directory you want to remove. For example, type "Med"
   (without the quotation marks) in the Named field.

3. Click Find Now.

4. Right-click on the "Med" folder, and then click Delete.

NOTE: If you worked on any of the labs or annotated any topics, the information
is saved in the Lists and Labs directories. If you remove these directories, the
information will be lost.
