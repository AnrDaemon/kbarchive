TITLE   :SNA Server 2.11 May Send 2nd BID to 3270 Emulator in Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::2.11,2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When using SNA Server 2.11, a 3270 emulator may log one of the following sense
code errors:

   0813 = Bracket Bid Reject -- No RTR Forthcoming
   081B = Receiver in transmit mode

This problem did not occur with SNA Server 2.1.

CAUSE
=====

With any 3270 emulator that supports the SNA Server EIS (FMI) interface, the SNA
Server passes a STATUS BID request up to the emulator when it receives a BID
from the host. However, it also passes a STATUS BID request to the emulator when
it receives data marked as BB. The emulator rejects this second STATUS BID
request with the sense code 0813 or 081B.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server 2.11. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack 1. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following

MORE INFORMATION
================

following message flow may be observed:
