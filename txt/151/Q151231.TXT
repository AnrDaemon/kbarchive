TITLE   :XFOR: MSExchangeMSMI Session Error EventID 2376
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The MS Mail Connector Interchange (MSMI) logs a configuration problem in the NT
event log when it tries to deliver a Non-Delivery Report (NDR) to a MS Mail
user. The NDR is coming back from an adjacent 1984 X.400 Message Transfter Ageng
(MTA). Microsoft Exchange Server acts as a messaging switch between MS Mail and
any 1984 X.400 system. The Microsoft Exchange MTA hands the NDR to MSMI without
passing a distinguished name (DN) for the recipeint of the NDR. Since the
recipient's address is still an X.400 address, MSMI complains correctly that the
proper MS Mail gateway component is not set up at the MS Mail Connector
Postoffice.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
Exchange Server. This issue is corrected in Microsoft Exchange Service Pack1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Exchange MTA passes the DN to MSMI for further delivery of the NDR
to the MS Mail based recipient.
