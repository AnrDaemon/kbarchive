The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

When you attempt to print from a Windows NT computer to an Apple LaserWriter Pro
810 using the TCP/IP protocol, the print job may appear in the queue, but it
does not print. The job must be deleted manually. The printer will also have to
be reset in order for it to work with Macintosh clients. The Windows NT computer
can ping the printer and the printer works when printing directly from a
Macintosh client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To print from a Windows NT server or workstation to an Apple LaserWriter Pro 810
using the TCP/IP protocol, an updated ROM is required for the printer.


For more information on obtaining the updated ROM for the Apple LaserWriter Pro
810, contact Apple Technical support.
