SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit contains a program, Mapisend.exe, which is
a 32-bit command line utility to send mail messages and file attachments. This
program is also available in the Microsoft Mail Resource Kit.

Microsoft Exchange Server Administrators may need to run this program
automatically, using the AT Scheduler in Windows NT or the Winat.exe program
that ships in the Windows NT Resource Kit.

This article explains how to send mail using Mapisend.exe and the AT Scheduler.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Programs scheduled with the Windows NT AT Scheduler are run by the Windows NT
Schedule service. To send mail to an Exchange mailbox using the Mapisend.exe
program, the Windows NT Schedule service must start using a domain account. By
default, the Windows NT Schedule service starts using the LocalSystem account.

To use the Mapisend.exe program with the AT scheduler:

1. Log on to Windows NT with a domain account, for example Domain\User.

2. In Windows NT Control Panel, double-click Services.

3. Click the Schedule tab, and then click Startup.

4. Under Log On As, click This Account, and then click the ellipsis to bring up
   the list of domain users. Select Domain\User.

5. In the Password and Confirm Password fields, type the password for
   Domain\User.

6. Under Startup Type, click Automatic. This causes the service to automatically
   start when the computer is started.

7. Click OK, and then close the Services dialog box.

8. In Windows NT Control Panel, double-click Mail and Fax.

9. Create a profile with the name Sendmail. Add the Exchange Server service to
   the profile.

10. Make sure that the Windows NT account, Domain\User, that you specified to
   start the Windows NT Schedule service has permissions to open the Exchange
   mailbox specified in the profile. Start the Exchange Server Administrator
   program, and in the mailbox's properties, on the Permissions page, give the
   mailbox (the mailbox that the profile you created in step 9 points to) Send
   As permission (or Mailbox Owner permission). On the Tools menu, click
   Options, and then click the Permissions tab, and make sure you select the
   correct options so that the Permissions page is displayed for each mailbox
   object, with the user rights.

11. You can place the following command in a batch file that you can then use
   with the AT Scheduler service or the Winat.exe program:

   mapisend.exe -u <profile name> -p password -r <recipients> -s
   <subject>

The <profile name> is the name of the profile you created in step 9,
Mapisend. Mapisend.exe requires a password. The password specified with the -p
option is only to prevent Mapisend.exe from failing. It is not used.
Please refer to the documentation accompanying the Mapisend.exe program for more
information on all the command line switches available.

NOTE: For the AT Scheduler to successfully run the Mapisend.exe program, you must
be logged on to Windows NT as a Domain\User. This User must be the account used
to start the Windows NT Schedule service and must have access to the mailbox
that Mapisend.exe logs on to.
