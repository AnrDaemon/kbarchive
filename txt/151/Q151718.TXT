SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to configure an MS-DOS-mode shortcut in Windows 95
for optimal memory management.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To manage each MS-DOS-mode shortcut separately, configure the MS-DOS shortcuts
to use custom configuration files.

To enable the use of the High Memory Area (HMA) and Upper Memory Blocks (UMBs) in
the Upper Memory Area (UMA), add the following lines to the custom Config.sys
file:

   Device=C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS
   Device=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE NOEMS ; or RAM to use Expanded Memory
   DOS=HIGH,UMB

To load device drivers high from the Config.sys file, use the following syntax:

   DeviceHigh=C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND\DRVSPACE.SYS /MOVE ; loads DRVSPACE high

Other Config.sys commands that help preserve conventional memory include:

   BuffersHigh=
   FCBSHigh=
   FilesHigh=
   InstallHigh=
   LastDriveHigh=
   StacksHigh=

To load TSRs high from the custom Autoexec.bat file, use the following syntax:

   LoadHigh=C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND\DOSKEY.COM ; loads DOSKey high
