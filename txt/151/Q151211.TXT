TITLE   :Nested Batch Files in Logon Script Hangs at Execution
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.5,3.51 WFW:3.11 Win95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A DOS window appears on a client computer and shows the logon script executing.
The logon script finishes, but the Windows NT logon script (in Windows 95) or
the Lan Manager logon script (in Windows for Workgroups) dialog box appears and
displays the following message:

   Please wait while your logon script executes...

The client computer stops responding until you click Cancel.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT logon script contains a nested batch file and the current
directory is changed in the nested batch file as shown in the following logon
script example. Assume Test1.bat and test2.bat are located in the
Repl\Imports\Scripts directory and Gandalf is a Windows NT Server 3.51 Primary
Domain Controller (PDC) with no service packs installed.

The logon script contains only one line:

   test1.bat

Test1.bat contains the following lines:

NET USE K: \\Gandalf\Netlogon k:\test2.bat

Test2.bat contains the following lines:

   net use P: \\Gandalf\Sms_shr
   net use y: \\Gandalf\Sms_pkgd
   P:
   CD\            <---- line causing the logon script dialog box to hang
                  until you click Cancel

   COPY CL_Dos.txt C:\Temp

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the nested batch file code for Test2.bat so
that it avoids using the Change Directory (Cd) command:

   net use P: \\Gandalf\Sms_shr
   net use y: \\Gandalf\Sms_pkgd
   COPY p:\CL_Dos.txt C:\Temp

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
