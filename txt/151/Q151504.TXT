-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use the Server Push function with IIS, the browsers prompt you
to save a file. The Server Push function uses the multipart/x-mixed mime type.

CAUSE
=====

IIS does not implement the Server Push function.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Server Push function is usually used to display data on the client without
your input. For example, a Web server can push a Please Wait message to the
client after a database query is submitted. This prevents the user from clicking
the Submit button again, which causes another query to be queued.

Additional query words: pushpull pull netscape explorer
