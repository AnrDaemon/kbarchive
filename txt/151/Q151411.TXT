Following is the text of the Readme.txt.

Ssscc.dll 1309b
---------------

This file fixes two problems in Visual C++/Visual SourceSafe integration.

 - Sometimes, when performing a source code control operation on a very large
   number of files, Visual C++ crashes.

 - Sometimes, you add a new project to Visual SourceSafe from inside Visual C++,
   and you are not prompted for what SourceSafe project to use. Instead, the C++
   files go directly into the SourceSafe root project ($/).

Neither of these problems happens reliably or predictably in any version of
Visual SourceSafe. But if you copy this file over the existing Ssscc.dll in your
SourceSafe WIN32 directory (Windows NT Intel or Windows 95), NTAXP directory
(Windows NT Alpha), or NTMIPS directory (Windows NT MIPS), then the problems
should never occur.
