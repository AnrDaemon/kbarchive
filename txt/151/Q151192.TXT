-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article tells you how to change the default wallpaper to a company logo or
other Bitmap graphic (BMP). Windows NT Workstation uses WINNT.BMP or
WINNT256.BMP as the default wallpaper. Windows NT Server uses LANMAN.BMP or
LANMA256.BMP as the default wallpaper. The number of colors used by the video
adapter determines which BMP is used. Systems set to 16 colors use WINNT.BMP for
Workstation and LANMAN.BMP for Server. Systems set to 256 colors use
WINNT256.BMP for Windows NT Workstation and LANMA256.BMP for Windows NT Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Do the modifications required for Computer Profile Setup (CPS) in the
%SystemRoot%\System32\Profile.inf of the image created with Uplodprf.exe. The
BMP file you use must be in the %SystemRoot% (WINNT35) directory when you run
Uplodprf.exe.

Original PROFILE.INF:

Ifstr(i) $(!STF_PRODUCT) == "WINNT"
    ReplaceIniKeyValue "Win.ini", DeskTop,  Wallpaper, "winnt.bmp "
Else
    ReplaceIniKeyValue "Win.ini", DeskTop,  Wallpaper, "winnt256.bmp "
Endif

Example:

Ifstr(i) $(!STF_PRODUCT) == "WINNT"
    ReplaceIniKeyValue "Win.ini", DeskTop,  Wallpaper, "BMP16.bmp"
Else
    ReplaceIniKeyValue "Win.ini", DeskTop,  Wallpaper, "BMP256.bmp"
Endif

You can specify the same BMP filename for both lines if desired.
