SUMMARY
=======

Scrolling a complex image in a CScrollView can be very slow and jerky since
OnDraw() is called for every WM_VSCROLL and WM_HSCROLL message. While only part
of the window is invalidated and redrawn, the whole painting code gets called
every time.

This CMemDC sample demonstrates drawing to a memory bitmap instead of the screen.
The complex, time-consuming drawing code only needs to be performed when the
image changes and in OnInitialUpdate(). During OnPaint(), the only work that
needs to be done is a simple BitBlt from the memory bitmap to the screen.

The sample code draws a complex pattern on its client area. A menu option toggle
allows the user to see the speed difference between using and not using the
offscreen bitmap. Printing and print preview are supported through the normal
printing code, and do not use the memory bitmap.

While CMemDC is a 32-bit sample, the same technique can be used in 16-bit MFC
applications.
