TITLE   :Network Applications Database (NAD) Share Point Corruption
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbDatabase kbPGC smsdatabase smspgc

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


After running RSAPPCTL, Program Group Controller (PGC) icons point to an
incorrect share. Clicking on those icons results either in an incorrect shared
application being launched from the server, or in an error.

CAUSE
=====

Applications Manager is responsible for building and maintaining the Network
Applications Database (NAD), on each site server (see Appendix C, SMS System
Flow of the "SMS Administrators Guide" for further information). When RSAPPCTL
is run, it sends a 'RESET ALL' command to the Applications Manager component of
the site(s) you specified when running RSAPPCTL. In SMS 1.0 and 1.1, the reset
may be processed incorrectly, causing the NAD to contain incorrect share points
for some shared packages.


WORKAROUND
==========

Be sure to back up your SMS site before attempting the following workaround.
(See Appendix K of the "SMS Administrators Guide" for correct backup
procedures)

NOTE: Clients updating PGC information by polling during the following procedure
may have their registry updated with incomplete shared packages information. Be
sure that clients poll the server for new PGC information after the following
procedure is completed.

For any sites that demonstrate the NAD share point corruption, perform the
following:

1. Stop the Applications Manager and Maintenance Manager services on the site
   server..

2. Delete the NAD files on the site server. These are located in <SMS
   Root>\SITE.SRV\MAINCFG.BOX\APPCTL.SRC\DATABASE

3. Delete the NAD files on the logon server(s) for that site: These are located
   in <SMS Root>\LOGON.SRV\APPCTL.BOX\DATABASE

4. Restart the Applications Manager and Maintenance Manager services.

5. Ensure that the NAD files are re-created on the site and logon servers. Note
   that the time it takes for this last step to occur depends on the frequency
   of the services for that site. Applications and Maintenance Manager logs will
   record the re-creation of the NAD files.

6. Ensure that clients poll the server for updated PGC information. You may see
   a dialog box indicating that the client is deconfiguring and reconfiguring
   shared package information.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management
Server version 1.2.
