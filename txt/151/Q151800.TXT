SYMPTOMS

When Windows 95 boots into mini-Windows with low conventional memory during a
disk uncompress operation, the following error message may be displayed:

   Windows disk compression is incompatible with DoubleDisk.

   You must use the software provided by DoubleDisk to manage any compressed
   drives. DRVSPACE 525

CAUSE

This error can occur on computers with 326K to 332K free conventional memory
when mini-Windows starts.

RESOLUTION

To work around this issue, perform a clean boot to free conventional memory. To
do so, follow these steps:

1. Restart your computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, press
   the F8 key, and then choose "Step-By-Step Confirmation" from the Startup
   menu.

2. Press N to avoid loading any unnecessary device drivers or TSRs.

   NOTE: If you are prompted whether to load the following items, press Y. These
   items are required by Windows 95:

   - DoubleSpace driver
   - System registry
   - Himem.sys
   - Ifshlp.sys
   - Dblbuff.sys
