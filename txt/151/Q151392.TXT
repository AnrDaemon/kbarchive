TITLE   :Cannot Connect to MSN After Installing Pipeline
PRODUCT :The Microsoft Network
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.3,2.0,2.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:appscomp kbmsn kbAppCompatibility

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network versions 1.3, 2.0, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Pipeline version 3.5, you may not be able to connect to MSN,
The Microsoft Network. When you click Connect, all the boxes on the Sign-In
screen, except Cancel, may be unavailable and the telephone number may not be
dialed.

CAUSE
=====

Pipeline version 3.5 installs its own version of the Wsock32.dll file in the
Windows\System folder. This file is 57K in size. The original Wsock32.dll file
(which is 65K in size) installed by MSN is renamed to Wsock32.ms.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Pipeline Switcher program lets you switch between the two Wsock32.dll files.
To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Close the Sign-In screen and all Winsock programs.

2. Run the Pipeline TCP/IP Switcher program.

3. Click "Switch to using the original 32-bit Winsock."

If the switch is successful, you see the message "The original Winsock has now
been installed." If you receive an error message, Wsock32.dll is still in
memory. Check the task list to make sure no Winsock programs are listed. If
Rnaapp is listed, click Rnaapp and then click End Task. Then, try the Switcher
program again.

If the Pipeline TCP/IP Switcher program is not functioning properly, you can
manually switch the Wsock32.dll files by following these steps:

1. Rename the Wsock32.dll file in the Windows\System folder to Wsock32.old.

2. Rename the Wsock32.ms file in the Windows\System folder to Wsock32.dll.
