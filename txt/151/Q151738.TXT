MORE INFORMATION

Bcc Addresses Shown on To Line
------------------------------

Addresses from the Bcc line of a mail message may appear on the To line if you
leave the To line blank.


Long Attached File Name Causes GP Fault
---------------------------------------

If you receive a message that contains a file with a name that contains more than
255 characters, you receive the following error message when you attempt to open
the message:

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.


Mismatched Quotation Marks
--------------------------

If you reply to a message that has the addressees' friendly names in quotation
marks and there is a mismatched set of quotation marks, your reply message may
not be delivered to some of the addressees.


GP Fault Attempting to Check Member Properties Offline
------------------------------------------------------

If you are not connected to MSN, open an MSN mail message, attempt to view the
member's properties by double-clicking the name in the From field, and then
click Cancel on the Sign In screen, a blank User Properties dialog box appears.
You may also receive the following error message:

   GUIDE caused an invalid page fault in module KERNEL32.DLL at 0137:bff9a07c


Inaccurate Non-Delivery Message
-------------------------------

If you send mail to an invalid Internet address, you may receive a non- delivery
message that states you sent mail to an invalid MSN account.


Cannot Cancel Mail Delivery
---------------------------

Clicking the Cancel button while e-mail messages are being delivered does not
stop delivery of messages. Clicking Cancel also does not stop the updating of
headers when you are using Remote Mail.
