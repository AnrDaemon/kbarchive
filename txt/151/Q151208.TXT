TITLE   :XCLN: Unable to Copy Mssp2_en.lex During Client Setup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you attempting an Exchange client setup on a computer that is using a
shared copy of Office 95, the following error messages may be encountered:

   Unable to copy mssp2_en.lex the file is currently in use.

-OR-

   Setup cannot create folder <Run from Server
   Path>\msapps\proof\mssp2_en.lex

MORE INFORMATION
================

Exchange does share a copy of this file with Office95. If the share where this
is located, or the file itself, is marked read-only, the above error message
will occur during the client setup.

RESOLUTION
==========

To get around this error message make sure the file is not marked read- only,
and if the file is on NTFS, change the permissions to Change for everyone and
rerun setup.

This solution will not work if any user has the .LEX file open. An alternate
solution using either the Microsoft Exchange Setup Editor or Custom Setup, is to
deselect Spelling as an option. This will not attempt to install spelling, but
spell checking will still be an option on Windows NT or Windows 95 clients,
because the registry entries still point to the shared directories on the
Server. Spell checking will be available but will use the older .LEX file for
spell checking.
