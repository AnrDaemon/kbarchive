-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This article applies to the BETA release of Windows 95
Remoteboot.

SYMPTOMS
========

During the auto-detection of the network adapter, a Windows 95 remoteboot system
may stop responding (hang) or crash. This is a known problem with NE2000 and
Intel EtherExpress Pro network adapters.

RESOLUTION
==========

Retry Windows 95 Setup, and when you trim the list of devices to be detected,
remove all network adapters. Add the adapter manually if detection misses the
network adapter. Set the IRQ and I/O address settings for the adapter, and be
sure to add the NetBEUI protocol.
