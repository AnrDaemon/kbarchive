MORE INFORMATION
================

Two versions of Encarta 96 Encyclopedia are available. One version is an MPEG
version that is most likely pre-installed on computers that have MPEG software
or hardware installed. The other (retail) version of Encarta 96 is usually
pre-installed in non-MPEG capable computers or purchased from retail software
vendors.

Because the MPEG version of Encarta 96 was designed for Windows 95, only the
retail version of Encarta will run correctly on machines with Microsoft Windows
3.x.

To check which version of Encarta is installed on your computer, follow these
steps:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

2. In the Named box, type "enc9632.exe" (without the quotation marks), and then
   click Find Now.

3. In the list of found files, right-click the Enc9632.exe file, and then click
   Properties.

4. Click the Version tab.

   If the file version shown is version 4.14.0037, the retail version of Encarta
   96 is installed on your computer.

   If the file version shown is version 4.14.0041, the MPEG version of Encarta 96
   is installed on your computer.
