SUMMARY
=======

Edbutil /D performs off-line compaction of the Private Information Store. You
might notice that the size of the Priv.edb file does not decrease after you run
Edbutil when you have just deleted a large number of users using the Microsoft
Exchange Administrator program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After a user is deleted, a background cleanup thread marks the objects owned by
that user as deleted. The disk space can only be recovered by Edbutil after this
process is complete and if a large number of users are deleted, it will take a
while.

The background cleanup thread logs entries in the Windows NT Application Event
log if the "Background Cleanup" diagnostic logging option in the Private
Information Store is set to Medium.
