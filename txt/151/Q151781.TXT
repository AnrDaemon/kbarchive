SUMMARY
=======

A local profile can be turned into a server-based profile and vice versa. This
can be a useful time-saver if a profile already exists in one form or the other
and you want to copy it. It also allows for a consistent desktop when logging on
to the domain or on to a local account.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a user ARRENC logs on to a Windows NT computer, a local profile called
ARREN000 (the first 5 letters of the user name plus 000) is created in the
%SystemRoot%\System32\Config directory. To use this profile as a server- based
profile, rename the file to something like Arrenc.usr (the .usr extension is the
important part) and specify this file as the user's profile in User Manager.

Conversely, an existing username.usr file such as ARRENC.USR can be renamed as
ARREN000 and placed in the %systemroot\ system32\config directory, and it will
become the user's local profile (assuming no profile is specified in User
Manager).

This also allows a common profile to be used when the user logs in to the domain
and logs on with a local account.
