TITLE   :FPNW Does Not Search Trusted Domains for Object Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When an application sends a 'Get Bindery Object Name' request to a File and
Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) server, FPNW does not search trusted domains
for the object; it returns the message 'No Such Object.' An example of this can
be seen in PSERVER. A PSERVER will print 'UNKNOWN' as the user name of the user
submitting the job, or it will not print the job at all.

CAUSE
=====

When you attempt to log on to an FPNW server, FPNW sends a logon request to the
local security authority (LSA) and leaves the domain field blank. The LSA will
search all trusted domains for you. When an application sends a 'Get Bindery
Object Name' request, FPNW cannot send this to LSA and must process the request
itself. FPNW will only look in the local database for the object.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the problem you are having is with PSERVER printing 'UNKNOWN' instead of the
users name, simply set the banner page name field to the users login name. For
example:

   CAPTURE /Q=PRINTQ /NAME=<username>

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in File and Print Services for
Netware version 3.51. This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
