The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51

SYMPTOMS
========

The Seiko Smart Label Printer Pro is supported under Windows NT 3.1, but you may
have difficulty sharing this printer under Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51. Client
systems are unable to communicate with the printer.

RESOLUTION
==========

The printer requires a new printer driver for Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51. The driver
is available as Slp.zip on CompuServe in the WINSHARE forum or from Somarsoft at
http://www.somarsoft.com or ftp.somarsoft.com. A helper DLL, a WordBasic macro,
and documentation accompany the driver.

Because this is a standard printer driver, you can share the printer on the
network and access it from client systems.
