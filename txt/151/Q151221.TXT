SUMMARY
=======

Remote Control may not seem to work over TCP/IP if the WINS server that the
client is reporting to is different than the WINS server that the
administrator's tool is using. This is due to the fact that the Remote Control
client does not register with the WINS server at boot but rather when Wuser.exe
is run.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the client is booted Usertsr.exe is loaded; however, the client does not
register the <43h> name to the WINS server at that time. Instead Wuser.exe
is relied upon to register with the WINS server. Because the client does not
report to WINS until Wuser.exe is loaded, the SMS administrator's utility may
not work until WINS replication has taken place if the client reports to a
different WINS server than the one the SMS administrator's utility is using.

Also, when Wuser.exe is stopped, it sends a release request to the WINS database
that removes the <43h> entry.
