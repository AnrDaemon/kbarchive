TITLE   :RUI_BID Improperly Handles Lua_Peek_Data Causing Data Truncation
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbprogramming

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If an LUA RUI application calls RUI_BID followed by RUI_READ, the read data may
be missing the leading bytes returned in the RUI_BID lua_peek_data. For
example:

1. Verb:          RUI_BID
   Description:   Notifies the RUI application that a message is waiting
                  to be read using RUI_READ.
   Returns:       lua_peek_data (Contains the first 12 bytes of the
                  message data)

2. Verb:          RUI_READ
   Description:   Receives responses, SNA commands, and data into Windows
                  LUA application's buffer
   Returns:       the data that has been requested

Using these verbs in this sequence results in the following:

   Verb:       Returns:

   RUI_BID     the first 12 bytes of the data

   RUI_READ    the 13th through xx  bytes of the data. The first 12 bytes
               are missing in the response.

CAUSE
=====

The RUI_BID verb is attempting to handle the data instead of just "peeking" at
it without making any modifications. Then when the RUI_READ verb is called, it
checks to see if the first 12 bytes have been read. Since RUI_BID has modified
the data, RUI_READ only reads in the 13th through xx bytes of data.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server 2.11
Service Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server
2.11 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
