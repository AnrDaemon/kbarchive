By design, spinners alone can be used only with numeric data. However, using a
Custom container class, you can combine the functionality and appearance of the
Spinner with a text box holding DateTime data.

This sample also allows you easier access to the data you are working with by
providing custom ControlSource and Value properties, which work with the
cntSpinDate class just as they do with other objects.

The changes to the Date and Time are based on where you place the cursor in the
TextBox control. You may also use the Up and Down arrow keys to activate the
Spinner events. A second text box displaying the corresponding Day of the Week
is updated as changes are made. You can use the "Reset" button to set the text
box value to the current Date and Time.

NOTE: The ControlSource property for the custom controls must be manually entered
in the Property sheet.

To use this class with Visual FoxPro version 3.0 or 3.0b, you need to compile the
class library first with this command:

      COMPILE FORM Spindate.vcx

Spindate.exe contains the following files:

   Readme.txt   -- contains a description of the class
   Spindate.vcx -- contains the cntSpinDate class
   Spindate.vct
