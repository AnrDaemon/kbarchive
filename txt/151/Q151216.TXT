PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A memory leak occurs in the Windows NT Virtual DOS Machine (NTVDM) used by
Windows 16-bit (Win 16) applications when opening and closing COMM ports on
Windows NT 3.51.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows on Windows (WOW) support code for Win 16 applications allocates a
write buffer whenever a Win 16 application opens a COMM port. The WOW was not
releasing the write buffer when the Win 16 application closed the COMM port.

RESOLUTION
==========

The WOW has been modified to release the write buffer when a COMM port is
closed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
