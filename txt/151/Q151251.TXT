TITLE   :XCLN: Printing Blank Page with Exchange Client for Windows 3.x
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print from a Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 3.x to an HP III
series printer or an HP DeskJet 820Cse, an extra sheet will be ejected. Nothing
will be printed on this sheet.

CAUSE
=====

This is due to the way that the printer driver deals with low memory situations.
Microsoft Exchange attempts to do printing on Win16 using banding. This is not
always the case and these printers exhibit this. When we try to print to these
printers, the first band it gives is a text-only band covering the entire page.
Each band after this will be a graphics only band covering part of the page.
Because we only ask for graphics bands, we ignore the text-only band and just
use the graphics bands. Since the HP driver will ignore text primitives in a
graphics only band, you only see the graphics primitives when you print.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are several possible workarounds to this issue.

 - Try to add the following setting to the options section of the Exchng.ini
   file:

      UsePrintBanding=0

   If the problem persists, add more memory if the computer has 8-megabytes (MB)
   or less

   -or-

 - If every font in your message is a TrueType font, you can select the Print
   TrueType as graphics checkbox (open the File menu, click Print, click the
   Setup button, and click the Options button). This will print your message
   correctly but it will not print any fonts that are not TrueType.

   -or-

 - If the HP printer has PostScript, you can use it as the Postscript driver
   does not exhibit this behavior.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 4.0, of Microsoft
Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
