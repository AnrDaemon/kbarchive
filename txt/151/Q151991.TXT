KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

An OS/2 client running the NetWare requestor copies files to an FPNW server from
a command prompt. The last modified dates of the files on the FPNW server do not
match those of the original files. The dates and times of some of the files are
set to the current date and time. This may not happen with all files being
copied. This problem does not happen from File Manager.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in File and Print Services for
NetWare version 3.51. This problem was corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack
for Windows NT and Windows NT Server version 3.51. For information on obtaining
