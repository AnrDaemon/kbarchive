-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run AT on a remote computer, it can result in an "access denied" error.

CAUSE
=====

This error condition occurs because you do not have the correct access
privileges. Administrative privileges are required for remote AT activity.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Assume a user issues an AT command on a remote computer. For example, from
computer A, UserA issues the command

   <AT \\computerB 18:00 /interactive "notepad">

This has the following two results:

1. ComputerA will try to establish an IPC$ connection to ComputerB, using the
   account UserA. The Server Message Block (SMB) command is <C session setup
   & X, and C tree connect & X, Share = \\computerB\IPC$>. UserA must
   have administrative privileges, otherwise the attempt results in an "access
   denied" error.

2. Schedule will start up on ComputerB using the account you specified with the
   Schedule service in the Services tool in Control Panel. By default, it uses
   the System account.
