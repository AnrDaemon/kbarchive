TITLE   :APPC DISPLAY Verb May Return Incorrect LU6.2 Session Info
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::2.0,2.1,2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When an Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) application calls the
DISPLAY function and requests information on active LU6.2 sessions (using the
sess_info structure), SNA Server may return incorrect Request/Response Unit (RU)
sizes or pacing window sizes.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server APPC DISPLAY function implements sess_info formatting incorrectly
in some cases, namely, where the LU-SSCP session properties are returned with
the mode name from the PLU-SLU session. This could cause the APPC application to
retrieve RU sizes or pacing window sizes that do not match the actual values
negotiated on the PLU-SLU BIND.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 2.11 and 2.11 Service
Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
