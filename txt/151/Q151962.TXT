TITLE   :System Appears to Stop when Adding Users to Large Global Groups
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Whenever users are added to user-defined global groups, CPU use for the LSASS
service is taxed to its limit, causing the domain controller to come to a halt
for a few minutes. The user-defined global groups must contain thousands of
users for this to occur. This issue has been encountered with user-defined
global groups that contain 2,000 to 4,000 users.

CAUSE
=====

When Netlogon calls the security account manager (SAM) to enumerate the global
group's attributes, the SAM enumerates the attributes for each user in the
global group, causing an extreme load on the domain controller.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the
