TITLE   :BUG: Insert Object of an Imager File Causes Error or Hangs Mac
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenvkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using Microsoft Imager to insert an Imager object into a Microsoft Visual
FoxPro for Power Macintosh general field, the machine may hang or crash with a
"Bus Error" or a "Type 10 Error."

If the machine hangs, you will be forced to press CMD+OPT+ESC and Force Quit
Imager. If you have to Force Quit Imager, Visual FoxPro then returns the
message:

   OLE error: Application started but did not register a class factory.

This typically occurs with large images.

CAUSE
=====

The OLE error "Application started but did not register a class factory" is a
symptom of low memory. Either the memory partition allocated for Microsoft
Imager or the memory partition allocated for Visual FoxPro is too small to
perform the requested operation.

When dealing with Microsoft Imager, the problem usually occurs because the image
is too large to load into the memory partition of Microsoft Imager. This can be
determined by trying to insert a small image into a general field, something the
size of "Fox.pct" in the Microsoft Visual FoxPro main folder. If this behavior
succeeds, then the problem could be due to the size of the image you are trying
to insert.

WORKAROUND
==========

Increase the Preferred Size for both Imager and Visual FoxPro. Start by doubling
the Preferred Size for Imager. If this does not solve the problem, then begin
increasing the Preferred Size of Visual FoxPro in 1024K increments until the
image is successfully inserted into the general field.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Load Microsoft Imager and open a large image (something that is over half a
   megabyte in size and at least 256 colors).

2. From the Microsoft Imager menu, select View, and then select Summary Info.
   Check to ensure that the image's DPI setting is 72. If it is not 72, change
   the DPI to 72 and choose OK. (This step is necessary for Visual FoxPro to
   display the image correctly.)

3. From the File menu, select Save As, and then save the file using the PICT
   file type. Name the file TEST.PCT.

4. Exit Microsoft Imager and load Visual FoxPro. To test whether Visual FoxPro
   can display the image correctly, type the following in the Command window:

         _SCREEN.Picture=TEST.PCT

   and you should see the image tiled in the desktop.

5. Create a table containing a general field. Browse the table and add a record
   by pressing the CTRL+Y keys.

6. From the Edit menu, select Insert Object. Select From File, and then find and
   select TEST.PCT.

If the image is large enough, you will see Visual FoxPro appear to hang.
Actually, it is Microsoft Imager that has hung, because it does not have enough
memory available to continue with the process. You need to Force Quit the MS
Imager and increase the Preferred Memory size of Microsoft Imager, as instructed
above, and try again.
