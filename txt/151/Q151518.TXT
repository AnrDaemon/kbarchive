TITLE   :SNADS and PROFS Addresses Have Wrong Gateway Information
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you create PROFS or SNADS custom recipients in Microsoft Exchange that are
propagated via directory synchronization (dirsync) to MS Mail, these recipients
may contain invalid gateway names in the address.

CAUSE
=====

When a PROFS or SNADS address is propagated via dirsync into Microsoft Exchange,
the gateway portion of the address is stripped out to make it Microsoft
Exchange-compatible. This gateway information is stored in the Imported-From
field of the recipient's Raw Properties.

On outgoing mail, Microsoft Exchange reconstructs the address using the
Imported-From attribute. With Custom Recipients, there is no information in the
Imported-From field and Microsoft Exchange defaults to the gateway names of
MSPROFS for PROFS recipients and MSSNADS for SNADS recipients. When these
addresses are propagated to the MS Mail Global Address List (GAL), the invalid
gateway information makes the addresses unusable.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are three possible workarounds for this issue, depending on your
configuration:

 - Create the PROFS and SNADS custom recipients in a container that is not
   exported for dirsync.

 - If your DXA is acting as a server, do not request PROFS or SNADS address
   types from the requestors. The address will be represented by its MS proxy
   type.

 - Use Directory Import with a custom .CSV file to import the PROFS and SNADS
   addresses containing the proper GATEWAY/NODEID/USER format. This will import
   all proper information to the Imported-From raw property field. These
   addresses may then be safely included in dirsync.
