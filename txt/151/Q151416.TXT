TITLE   :Microsoft DNS Compatibility w/BIND Versions Earlier Than 4.9.4
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

By default, the Microsoft Domain Name System (DNS) implementation will send zone
transfers to non-Microsoft DNS secondaries with one resource record per message.
This behavior can be changed by editing the registry.

Zone transfers between Microsoft DNS servers will always be done using a faster
method, consisting of multiple records per message, and compression, regardless
of how the registry entry described below is set.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Zone transfers are the exchange of resource record information between a primary
DNS server and it's secondary servers.

Prior to BIND version 4.9.4, implementations of DNS would send one resource
record per message to secondary servers. For this reason, Windows NT defaults to
this standard when sending messages to a non-Microsoft secondary DNS server.

If the DNS secondary servers are running BIND version 4.9.4 or better, it will be
able to send multiple resource records at a time.

You can change the behavior of Microsoft DNS with the following change to the
registry:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:
   \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters

   This key does not exist by default.

3. Change BindSecondaries from 0 to 1.

   Once the key is there, change to 0 for improved performance

4. Stop and restart the Microsoft DNS server.

Transfers between Microsoft DNS servers will always be done with using the
faster, high compression method, regardless of how the BindSecondaries flag is
set.
