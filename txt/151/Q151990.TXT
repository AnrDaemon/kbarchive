TITLE   :Mail Client Incorrectly Resolves Names with Extended Characters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Windows NT 32-bit Mail client (Msmail32.exe), you may receive
unexpected results when you check names or try to locate names in the Address
Book using the keyboard. These unexpected results occur when the name includes
extended characters.

CAUSE
=====

There is a problem in a string-comparison routine in Store32.dll that was
exposed when comparing strings containing extended characters.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure that the appropriate sort order has been applied to the Post Office
where the address book resides. For example when a Scandanavian sort order is
required run "resort.exe -s". Once the Post Office has been sorted, the Global
Address List (GAL) should be rebuilt ensuring the appropriate sort order is also
applied to the GAL (Rebuild.exe). You can now install the associated hotfix on
all affected Windows NT workstations and then restart them.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A
supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-tested and should be
applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are
severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Product
Support Services for more information.
