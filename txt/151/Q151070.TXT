======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the DYNAMIC_DOWNCAST and STATIC_DOWNCAST macros are called, and a pointer
to a "const" object is passed, you see an error message similar to the following
in debug mode:

   Unhandled exception in downcast.exe (MFC40D.DLL); Stack Overflow.

In release builds, the application hangs.

CAUSE
=====

The DYNAMIC_DOWNCAST and STATIC_DOWNCAST macros invoke the AfxDynamicDownCast
and AfxStaticDownCast functions respectively. A code defect in Visual C++
version 4.1 causes these calls to be recursive if the object pointer passed as
the second parameter to either macro points to a "const" object. The end result
is a stack overflow.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, remove the "const" attribute for the object pointer
in the call to the appropriate DOWNCAST macro. You can do this by using the
"const_cast" operator as follows:

      //CMyDlg is derived from CDialog
      const CMyDlg dlg;

      //pdlg is a pointer to a const object
      const CMyDlg* pdlg = &dlg;

      DYNAMIC_DOWNCAST(CDialog, const_cast<CMyDlg*>(pdlg));

      // or

      STATIC_DOWNCAST(CDialog, const_cast<CMyDlg*>(pdlg));

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ 32-bit Edition
version 4.2.
