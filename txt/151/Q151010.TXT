TITLE   :IIS IDC: Err Msg: Error Performing Query
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

With Basic Authentication enabled on the Internet Information Server (IIS), when
you try to open an .IDC, you will get the following error message:

   Error Performing Query.

CAUSE
=====

The error occurs when you do not have access to the file and have not been
authenticated by the server. The Basic Authentication dialog box should be
displayed instead of the error.

The Internet Database Connector (Httpodbc.dll) tries to open the file using
IUSER_COMPUTERNAME and can not because of security. The server sends the above
error instead of an error 401 Authentication Required to the client.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Server version 1.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
