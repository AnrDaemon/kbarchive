TITLE   :Unable to Remote Control a Client on a Token-Ring Network
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Remote Control (Help Desk) to access a Systems Management
Server client on a token ring network with rings bridged together with
source-routing bridges (Loop Configuration), the following error message appears
in SMS Administrator (the SMS Admin UI):

   The remote workstation did not respond

CAUSE
=====

The Token-Ring "Loop Configuration" provides an alternate path if a bridge fails
and increases the network availability for the communication between segments
(the traffic between two segments can flow through multiple routes), but the SMS
Administrator is unable to manage unexpected packets (multiple copies of the
same packet).

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, upgrade to Systems Management Server 1.2.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
