PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER:windows:1.1,97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for Windows 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q194232.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you remove FrontPage using the Add/Remove Programs Control Panel icon
(Windows 95) or the Uninstall icon in Program Manager (Windows NT), the
FrontPage Content directory still exists on your hard disk.

CAUSE
=====

The Uninstall program removes only the following directories and files from the
root Web of your content area:

   _vti_bin
   _vti_txt
   center.gif
   index.htm

NOTE: When you uninstall FrontPage all of the data you created will not be
deleted by the FrontPage Setup program. FrontPage files that were not created by
you but that remain after you uninstall FrontPage are left to facilitate the
reinstallation of FrontPage. The files and folders left behind do not take up
much memory.

WORKAROUND
==========

To remove all FrontPage Web content from your computer, delete the Content
directory after you uninstall FrontPage.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you uninstall FrontPage, all FrontPage components (other than the files and
folders in the Content folder) are removed from your hard disk. By default, the
content folder is c:\FrontPage Webs\Content, although you can change the name of
this folder when you install FrontPage.

The default location for the FrontPage program is one of the following:

   c:\Program Files\Microsoft FrontPage (if you are using Windows 95)
   c:\Microsoft FrontPage (if you are using Windows NT)

If you created custom files or folders in these locations, FrontPage will not
remove these folders when you uninstall it. Uninstall will clear out system .dll
files unique to FrontPage and will clear out all FrontPage registry entries. The
following directories and all their contents remain in the root Web of your
content area after you uninstall FrontPage 97:

   _private
   _vti_cnf
   _vti_log
   _vti_pvt
   cgi-bin
   images

In addition to the directories listed above, another directory and all its
contents remain in the root Web of your content area after you uninstall
FrontPage 1.1:

   _vti_shm

In addition, any subwebs you created also remain on your hard disk.
