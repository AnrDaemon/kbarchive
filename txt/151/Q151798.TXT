======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To suppress the main Visual FoxPro screen in the development environment, or the
logo, product registration information, and sign-on screen in an executable
application, add the following command to the configuration file:

      MACSCREEN = OFF

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MACSCREEN command for the configuration file is new to Visual FoxPro. This
command, along with the TITLE command, allows developers to have more control
over how their run-time applications appear when loading.

A sample configuration file using these two command follows:

      ***Sample Config.fpm***
      MACSCREEN = OFF
      TITLE = My Exe File
      DEFAULT = "Macintosh HD:My Exe File"
      KEYCOMP = Mac

Additional query words: VFoxMac
