SYMPTOMS

When you install Microsoft Complete NBA Basketball for Windows in Windows 95,

      [Boot]
      system.drv=atmsys.drv
      atm.system.drv=system.drv

2. Modify the line in the [Boot] section that reads

   system.drv=atmsys.drv

   to read:

   system.drv=system.drv

3. Modify the line in the [Boot] section that reads:

   atm.system.drv=system.drv

   to read:

   ;atm.system.drv=system.drv
