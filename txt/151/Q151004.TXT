TITLE   :FIX: "PRG" File Type Missing in FoxPro File Group
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe400bug kbSSafe500fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Visual SourceSafe provides the ability to logically group files of different
types. For example, files that have a ".c" or ".h" extension may be considered
as Visual C++ files.

This functionality allows the developer to control the types of files displayed
in the List Files of Type option, which is displayed in many Visual SourceSafe
dialog boxes.

During Visual SourceSafe installation, FoxPro or Visual FoxPro is automatically
added to the File Group list in the SourceSafe Options dialog box under the File
Types tab. To observe this behavior, from the Visual SourceSafe menu, go to
[Tools][Options][File Types].

At the bottom of the dialog box, the FoxPro file types are displayed. The file
types shown are automatically grouped as FoxPro or Visual FoxPro files. However,
the *.prg file type, which is a major FoxPro file type, is missing.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. From the SourceSafe Explorer menu, select Tools. Select Options, and then
   select File Types.

2. In the File Groups dialog box, click FoxPro.

3. In the File Types included in File Group dialog box, add a ";" (without the
   quotation marks) followed by a space and "*.prg" (without the quotation
   marks) at the end of the existing line.

4. Click OK to close the dialog box.

NOTE: This change is only effective for the user logged on at the time the change
is made. This change is visible in the SS.INI file of the specific user in the
USERS folder.

To make this a global change, you need to modify the SRCSAFE.INI file in the root
folder of SourceSafe on the server.

The following entry in the SRCSAFE.INI file reflects the additional reference to
*.prg file types for the FoxPro product:

   File_Types = foxpro (*.sct; *.scx; *.frx; *.frt; *.vcx; *.vct *.prg)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual SourceSafe
5.0.
