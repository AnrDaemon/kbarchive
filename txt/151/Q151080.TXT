TITLE   :BUG: Printer Dialog Box Doesn't Show For Common Dialog Control
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Common Dialog control is used to invoke an Open dialog box, and if a file
is selected from that Open dialog box, and then if the Printer dialog box is
invoked using the same Common Dialog control, the Printer dialog does not
appear.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, reset the Flags property of the Common Dialog
control to zero (0) after showing the Open dialog box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. Microsoft is researching this issue and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps To Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start a new project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Place a Common Dialog control and two Command buttons on the form.

3. In the Click event for Command1, place the following code:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
           CommonDialog1.filename = "*.mdb"
           CommonDialog1.ShowOpen
         End Sub

4. In the Click event for Command2, place the following code:

         Private Sub Command2_Click()
           CommonDialog1.ShowPrinter
         End Sub

5. Run the project by pressing the F5 key. Click on the Command1 button to show
   the Open dialog box and select any MDB file (such as Biblio.mdb in the Visual
   Basic directory.) Then click on the Command2 button to show the Printer
   dialog box. Note that the Printer dialog box does not appear.

To implement the workaround, change the code in the Click event of the Command2
button to:

      Private Sub Command2_Click()
        CommonDialog1.Flags = 0
        CommonDialog1.ShowPrinter
      End Sub

The Printer dialog box appears even after the Open dialog box has been displayed.
