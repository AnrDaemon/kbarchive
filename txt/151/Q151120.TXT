500 Nations and Dogs 1.0a:

   

   Microsoft Home logo appears, then disappears. The program does not
   start.

CAUSE
=====

The Music Central README says to log on as Administrator to install the program.
This is not accurate.

You should log on as the person who is going to be using the program.

Only the user who first uses the program, the Administrator, and other users with
Administrator rights can run the program. Users without Administrator rights can
NOT run it.


RESOLUTION
==========

To allow a different User to access the program, do the following:

1. The user who first installed the program, or any user with 'Administrative'
   rights, should uninstall the program. Instructions for this process are
   included in the Readme file for the program.

2. Log in as the user who is going use the program.

3. Run the program to install it.

This allows the installing user, plus any users with 'Administrative' rights, to
run the program.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Multimedia
products listed at the top of this article. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There is no currently known way to enable all non-administrative users to use
the program.
