SUMMARY
=======

To modify permissions for a Web, the "Use unique permissions for this Web"
option must be selected on the Settings tab of the Web Permissions dialog box
(on the Tools menu, click Permissions).

When "Use same permissions as root Web" is selected on the Settings tab, Add and
Remove are unavailable (dimmed) on all tabs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When new Webs are created using FrontPage Explorer, their default permissions
are the same as the root Web. This means that all users who have rights to the
root Web have the same rights on the newly created Web. Therefore, Add and
Remove are unavailable, because the root permissions cannot be changed within a
new Web.

Unique permissions can be set so that a new Web will not inherit its permissions
settings from the root Web. This allows a Web to have unique Administrators,
Authors, and End Users, even if you make changes to the permissions of the root
Web at a later time.

To assign a unique permissions to a Web, follow these steps:

1. In FrontPage Explorer, click Permissions on the Tools menu.

2. Click the Settings tab, and click to select the "Use Unique Permissions For
   This Web" option.

3. Click Apply for the changes to take effect.

Once you have done this, Add and Remove will be available and specific Web
settings can be set.

For more information about authorizing Web authors, click Microsoft FrontPage
Help Topics on the Help menu, click the Index tab, and type:

   "Authors, authorizing" (without the quotation marks)

Double-click the selected text to go to the "To authorize a web author" topic.
