TITLE   :Configure Downstream Leased SDLC Connection Causes Error 3992
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup kbnetserv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You will get the following error when you configure a Downstream Leased SDLC
connection:

   Error: 3992

   Leased SDLC connections cannot support Incoming Calls.

   Leased connections do not require either end to initiate the
   connection, therefore both ends treat the connection as
   Outgoing Calls only.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server 2.11 Service Pack 1 included a fix that changed the default Allowed
Directions for Downstream Connections to Incoming Calls.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q139423 Downstream Connection Should Default to Incoming Calls

Service Pack 1 does not check to see if a SDLC connection is Leased before
defaulting the Allowed Directions setting to Incoming Calls. Error 3992 results
because Leased SDLC connections cannot support Incoming Calls.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use SNA Server Admin to create a new SDLC connection specifying Remote End as
Host System. After you configure this connection, go back into the Connection
Properties for this connection and change Remote End to Downstream.

SNA Server Admin has been updated to check whether a new downstream SDLC
connection is Leased before defaulting the Allowed Directions setting to
Incoming Calls.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version
2.11 Service Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA
Server 2.11 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack,
