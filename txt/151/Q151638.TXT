STATUS

the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The VALIDATE DATABASE command ensures that the locations of tables and indexes
in the current database are correct. The RECOVER clause displays a dialog
allowing the issuer to locate tables and indexes that are not in the locations
contained in the database.

Many commands in Visual FoxPro can be abbreviated to just four letters. There are
some exceptions when the first four letters of two or more commands are the
same. The VALIDATE DATABASE RECOVER command is not an exception to this
abbreviation feature in Visual FoxPro for Windows.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

 - Issue the following commands in the Command window:

      "OPEN DATABASE HOME()+"samples:data:testdata"
      VALI DATA RECO"

 - Note that you receive the following error message:

   Command contains unrecognized phrase/keyword
