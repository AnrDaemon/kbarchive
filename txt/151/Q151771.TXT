MORE INFORMATION
================

The LicReqst sample is a dialog-based MFC application that illustrates how to
use the IClassFactory2 interface to request an object's License key. LicReqst
displays the ProgID of each of the currently registered ActiveX controls in a
Listbox. When one of the displayed ProgID's is selected, an instance of the
corresponding control is created and then asked for it's License key. If a valid
key is returned, LicReqst displays the key and enables the "Copy to Clipboard"
button that allows the License key to be copied to the Clipboard. The License
key can then easily be pasted into code that uses the CWnd::CreateControl method
to dynamically create an instance of the Control.

LicReqst creates a textual version of the License key data in the form of a
declaration of an array of WCHAR when copying the key to the Clipboard. This is
done because the License key data could contain non-printable characters. A
human-readable version of the License key data is also provided for reference
and is included inside a Comment block in the final string that is copied to the
Clipboard.

For example, if an object uses the string "Copyright (c) 1994" (without the
quotes) for its License key, LicReqst would generate the following block of text
that could be copied to and pasted from the Clipboard:

     /*
     Copyright (c) 1994
     */ 

     WCHAR pwchLicenseKey[] =
     {
       0x0043,  0x006F,  0x0070,  0x0079,  0x0072,  0x0069,
       0x0067,  0x0068,  0x0074,  0x0020,  0x0028,  0x0063,
       0x0029,  0x0020,  0x0031,  0x0039,  0x0039,  0x0034,
       0x0020
     }; 

You can use the previous block of text in code that creates an instance of the
Licensed object, and you can use the pwchLicenseKey variable to specify the
object's License key.

For example, if MFC code is dynamically creating an instance of a Licensed
ActiveX Control using the Create method of a Visual C++ Component Gallery
generated wrapper class, the pwchLicenseKey variable can be used in the Create
call like this:

      BSTR bstrLicense = ::SysAllocStringLen(pwchLicenseKey,
          sizeof(pwchLicenseKey)/sizeof(WCHAR));

      m_MyControl.Create(NULL, WS_VISIBLE, CRect(10,10,10,10), this,
          2, NULL, FALSE, bstrLicense);

      ::SysFreeString(bstrLicense);

Note how a BSTR is created from the pwchLicenseKey variable and how the BSTR is
then used for the License key parameter in the Create call.

NOTE: The code in this sample that generates the text copied to the Clipboard
makes the assumption that it is being executed on a little endian system (Intel
x86-class processors). Because of this, it will not work correctly on big endian
system. For these systems, it is still possible to use the Helper function used
internally by the sample to request the License key from an object.

The sample uses a Helper function called RequestLicenseKey() to get the License
key from an object based on its ProgID. The source code for the
RequestLicenseKey() function is shown later in the Sample Code section.

To find other locations of interest in the sample source code, use the Find in
Files feature of the Visual C++ Developer Studio to search for the string named
SAMPLE CODE. This string has been used to tag each of the modified sections in
the source code.

NOTE: Running the LicReqst sample on a licensed machine to obtain an object's
License key, and then distributing that key to allow applications to be
developed on other non-licensed machines, may be a violation of established
copyrights. For more information and to determine if an object's License key can
be legally redistributed, refer to the License Agreement provided with the
object or contact the creator of the object.

   /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
   //  SAMPLE CODE - Implementation of the RequestLicenseKey function
   // 
   //  The RequestLicenseKey function uses the IClassFactory2 interface
   //  to request a License key from an object specified by its ProgID.
   // 
   //  Parameters:
   // 
   //    [out] BSTR& bstrLicenseKey
   //          Upon return, this BSTR will contain either a valid
   //          License key or an error message. It is the caller's
   //          responsibility to call ::SysFreeString on this BSTR.
   // 
   //    [in]  CString strProgID
   //          Specifies the ProgID of the object from which to request the
   //          License key.
   // 
   // 
   //  Return Value:
   // 
   //    A BOOL specifying success or failure. If TRUE is returned,
   //    the License key was retrieved successfully and the
   //    bstrLicenseKey parameter contains a valid License key. If
   //    FALSE is returned, the License key was not retrieved
   //    successfully and the bstrLicenseKey parameter contains a
   //    descriptive error string.
   // 
   //    Regardless of the return value, it is the responsibility of
   //    the caller to call ::SysFreeString on the returned bstrLicenseKey
   //    parameter.
   //
