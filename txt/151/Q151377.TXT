TITLE   :Incorrect Path for UINFO.XNF in Administrator's Guide
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbdocerr smsdocerr

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======


In the "Modifying the Default Form" section of Appendix G in the Systems
Management Server Administrator's Guide, Step 6 states the following:

1. In the Directories box, select the following path:

      SITE.SRV\MAINCFG.BOX\CLIENT.SRC\X86.BIN

This is incorrect. The correct path for UINFO.XNF is as follows:

   SITE.SRV\MAINCFG.BOX\CLIENT.SRC\X86.BIN\00000409

NOTE: The directory path may be different depending on the following
configuration settings:

   SITE.SRV\MAINCFG.BOX\<Platform>.bin\<Language - 8 digits>

For example, the <Platform> is one of the following: = X86, MIPS or ALPHA;
For <Language - 8 digits>, 00000409 is the default language used by
Systems Management Server. Please refer to Appendix E in the Systems Management
Server Administrator's Guide for additional Language mapping information.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
