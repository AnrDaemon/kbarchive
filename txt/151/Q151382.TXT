TITLE   :FIX: LoadBarState() Causes Assert In Bardock.cpp, Line 682

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1 
 - Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An assert can occur in bardock.cpp, line 682 when CFrameWnd::LoadBarState() is
called. This behavior occurs if SaveBarState() was previously called and more
than one CToolBar was docked at the bottom of the window.

CAUSE
=====

The assert occurs because CFrameWnd::EnableDocking() was called prior to
creation of the CToolBars.

RESOLUTION
==========

The assertion is unnecessary and can be ignored. To avoid the assertion, make
sure that CFrameWnd::EnableDocking() is called after all calls to
CToolBar::Create().

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ 32- bit Edition
version 4.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Visual C++ 4.0, the assertion occurs in bardock.cpp, line 657.

MFC maintains a CPtrArray of CControlBars. The validity of the CPtrArray is
checked when LoadBarState() is called. There are cases where the CPtrArray is
not initialized at this juncture but is initialized correctly later on.
Therefore, the assert is unnecessary.
