MORE INFORMATION
================

The opening animation in MSB Solar uses the Microsoft Video 1 (msvc) codec. The
animations between planets use the SuperMatch Cinepak (cvid) codec or a
combination of the Video 1 and SuperMatch Cinepak codecs. Other animations, such
as those in <planet name> At A Glance; for example, Jupiter At A Glance,
use the Intel Indeo (iv32) codecs.
