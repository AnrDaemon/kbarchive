TITLE   :XADM: Message Limits Incorrectly Calculated After 5.0 Upgrade
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After a Microsoft Exchange Server computer running Service Pack 3 or 4 has been
upgraded to Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0, if you had incoming and/or outgoing
message size limits on your mailbox, you may receive non-delivery reports (NDRs)
when you try to send mail. This will occur although the message being sent is
well under the specified limit on the mailbox. The NDR will look similar to the
following:

   Your message did not reach some of the intended recipients.... Either the
   message size exceeds the maximum allowed for the recipient or the transport,
   or you have exceeded the storage limit on your mailbox.

CAUSE
=====

The information store is incorrectly calculating the message limits, this error
causes the limit to be a negative number, resulting in the failure and NDR.


WORKAROUND
==========

Turn off message limits on the mailbox.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 5.0
Server U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query
