TITLE   :XCLN: PC Mail Users Cannot Open Macintosh Attachments
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send an attachment from a Microsoft Exchange client for Macintosh to a
PC Mail (SFS product; v3.5) Windows client, the attachment will be damaged. The
file name and file type information is lost. When you try to open the attachment
from the PC Mail Client, the following error will be generated:

   The application or the attached file <filename> (or one of its
   components) could not be found.

WORKAROUND
==========

From the PC Mail client, save the file to the hard drive. If the correct DOS
file extension is known, use the appropriate extension. Otherwise, save as
<filename>.doc. The filename will be lost, but the file can still be
viewed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0
Windows client. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange
Server U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query
