KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open the Recycle Bin, you may see two entries for some files.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you are using the SUBST command to assign a
substitute drive letter to the root folder of a drive that contains a Recycle
folder.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. When you use the SUBST command to substitute a drive
letter for a folder that contains a Recycle folder, the Recycle Bin is mirrored
on the substituted drive. This can result in deleted files appearing twice in
the Recycle Bin.

Additional query words: duplicate
