SUMMARY
=======

There are two types of folder conflict messages that can be generated: folder
design conflict messages and folder item conflict messages.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A folder DESIGN conflict message will be generated if two folder owners are
modifying the design of a folder from different replicas and their modifications
are completed within the same replication interval. Design changes include
permissions, forms, and views of a folder. Design conflicts will also be
generated if the folder replication list changes in multiple ways during a
replication interval. This can be done by Microsoft Exchange Administrator's
changing the replicas. These are purely informational and no action is
required.

A folder ITEM conflict message will be generated if two or more people modify the
same item in a folder on different replicas and they conflict or collide. The
owner of the folder will need to decide which version of the item should be
saved, which should be deleted, or whether to keep both versions.
