======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, versions 2.0, 2.1, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An MFC database application cannot update a dynaset-type CRecordset based on a
View in a SQL Server 6.00 data source, even if the operation observes the SQL
Server requirement that updates through Views only update a single base table.
The update will give the following error:

   Error: failure updating record.
   The cursor does not include the table being modified
   State:37000,Native:16933,Origin:[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver] [SQL
   Server]

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused by a bug in SQL Server 6.0 server cursors. For more
information on this problem, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q149917 FIX: 16933 Error on View Updated Through Server Cursor

RESOLUTION
==========

One workaround is to use snapshots with the cursor library to update the View.
You can use a dynaset with a View as long as you are not updating it. If you
must use a dynaset and need to update, try using a permanent or temporary table
instead of a View, or open a separate recordset as a snapshot.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug is corrected in Microsoft SQL Server version
6.50.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem only occurs when using a dynaset update. The recordset is opened
correctly. The dynaset is scrollable forward and backward and MoveNext() and
MovePrev() also work correctly but dynaset does not allow updates.
