The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft 3D Movie Maker for Windows, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Nickelodeon 3D Movie Maker for Windows, version 1.0 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use 3D Movie Maker, you may not hear background music, or you may
receive the following error message:

   MIDI not configured properly.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur for any of the following reasons:

 - The MIDI driver for your sound card is either not installed or is not
   configured properly.

 - The volume for your sound card's MIDI channel or for your speakers is not
   turned up.

 - The MIDI channel on your sound card is not set to Play.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to Multimedia,
   and then click Media Player.

   NOTE: If you are using Windows 98, click Start, point to Programs, point to
   Accessories, point to Entertainment, and then click Media Player.

2. On the Device menu, click MIDI Sequencer.

3. Open the Windows\Media folder, click the Canyon.mid file, and then click
   Open.

4. Click the Play button. If you hear the Canyon.mid file play, skip to step 6.

5. If you do not hear the Canyon.mid file play, click Volume Control on the
   Device menu. Make sure the Volume slider under MIDI is not set all the way
   down, and the Mute check box under MIDI is not selected. Also make sure the
   volume for your speakers is turned up, and the speakers are plugged in to the
   correct jack on your sound card.

   If you still do not hear Canyon.mid the file play, contact your sound card
   manufacturer for assistance in installing or properly configuring the MIDI
   driver for your sound card.

6. If you do hear the Canyon.mid file play, follow these steps:
   a. Click Start, point to Settings and then click Control Panel.

   b. Double-click Multimedia, then click the Midi tab.

   c. Under MIDI Output, click the Single Instrument option to select it, and
      then click Midi For Internal FM Synthesizer (or equivalent).

   d. Click OK, and then close Control Panel.

The MIDI driver for your sound card should now be configured properly, and you
should be able to hear background music in 3D Movie Maker.
