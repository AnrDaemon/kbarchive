TITLE   :PRB: SeeThru Property of Graph Control Was Not Implemented
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdocerr kbVBp400 kbDOCError

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Changing the value of the SeeThru property of the Graph control has no effect on
the behavior of the control.

CAUSE
=====

The SeeThru property of the Graph control is present but it was not implemented
in the Graph16.OCX or the Graph32.OCX controls. It was provided in the .VBX
version of the Graph control so that the control could be placed on top of other
controls. The primary reason for doing this was to allow a PictureBox control to
provide a background for the graph. The Visual Basic development team did not
think this was appropriate for an .OCX control, so this functionality was
intentionally omitted. This change was not noted in the documentation for Visual
Basic 4.0. The SeeThru property was retained to provide backward compatibility
only.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

WORKAROUND
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.
