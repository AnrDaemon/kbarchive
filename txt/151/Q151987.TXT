SYMPTOMS
========

You are using Server Manager on a primary domain controller (PDC) to promote a
backup domain controller (BDC) to be the PDC. Both computers are running Windows
NT 3.51, but they have different Service Packs applied (Service Pack 4 on the
new BDC and Service Pack 2 on the new PDC).The following event error appears in
the new BDC's event log:

   ID 3096
   The Windows NT domain controller could not be located


CAUSE
=====

The netlogon service is started on the new BDC before it is started on the new
PDC.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are

Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
