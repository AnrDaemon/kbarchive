PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When trying to set the Count property of the Forms collection, the following
error message is displayed:

   Error 380 - Invalid Property Value

This error message is incorrect. Visual Basic should display an error message
indicating that the property is read-only at run time.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not try to set the Count property of the Forms collection. This property is
read-only because it describes the number of open forms of the project. The
Count property can only be set indirectly by loading and unloading forms.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. Microsoft is researching this issue and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. In the Load event for Form1, place the following code:

      Private Sub Form_Load()
            Dim x As Object
            Set x = Forms
            x.Count = 1
      End Sub

3. Run the project by pressing the F5 key. The following error results:

   Error 380 - Invalid Property Value
