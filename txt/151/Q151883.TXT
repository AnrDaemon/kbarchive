SUMMARY
=======

If you have a COMPAQ personal computer and do not know whether a Software
Support Diskette (SSD) has been applied to it, or which version of the SSD has
been applied, follow these procedures.

You may want to use Compaq drivers rather than the drivers supplied on your
retail version of Windows NT. Compaq creates drivers in cooperation with
Microsoft to optimize the interaction of Microsoft software with your Compaq
hardware.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You may download the latest SSD from the Compaq Internet Site at
http://www.compaq.com or from the Compaq Download Facility at 713-518-1418. The
current Windows NT 3.5x/4.0 SSD is version 1.20A. The file is sp2465.exe.

To find out whether you are using the Microsoft or the Compaq hardware
abstraction layer (HAL), use one of the following methods:

1. In File Manager or Windows NT 4.0 Explorer, go to the WINNT root directory,
   then to System32 and look for the hal.dll file (winnt35\system32\hal.dll).

2. Check the time stamp on the file. If it is 1:20am then you have SSD 1.20.

or -

1. In File Manager or Windows NT 4.0 Explorer, go to the WINNT root directory,
   then to System32 and look for the hal.dll file (winnt35\system32\hal.dll).

2. Select Properties from the File menu on the menu bar.

3. Look in the Version Information box to determine the Product Version number.

If the version number is 3.1, 3.5, 3.51 or 4.00, then the Hal.dll from Compaq is
not installed.

You may use either of the above methods to check the version of driver files in
the %systemroot%\system32\drivers directory as well.
