KEYWORDS:kbmm kbprint kbusage kbPrintingkbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Cinemania for Windows 1996 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Some movies discussed in the Cinemania updates print only the movie title and
year when they are printed from the List Maker.

For example, the following movie from the January 96 update prints correctly from
the List Maker:

 - Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995) US, Comedy, 91, Rated PG-13, Color

However, another movie from the same update prints as follows from the List
Maker:

   Sense and Sensibility (1995)

WORKAROUND
==========

To print a list containing complete descriptions for all movies, do the
following:

1. On the List Maker drop-down menu, click Export List.

2. Give the list a name, such as "My Movie List" (without the quotation marks),
   and then click OK.

3. Save the list to the desktop. This creates a document icon on your desktop.

4. Double-click this icon to open the saved list in your text editor.

5. Print the list from the text editor.

All movies in the list now print with complete descriptions.

For more information about how to accomplish these tasks in Windows, see your
Windows printed documentation or online Help.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Cinemania for Windows,
1996 edition. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are trying to print a list that includes movies from the April update,
you need to remove these movies from your list before you export it from the
List Maker.
