TITLE   :ADIR() Works Differently in 3.0 than in 2.6
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, Professional Edition, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The ADIR() function in Visual FoxPro for Macintosh version 3.0 has been changed
to work more as it does in Visual FoxPro for Windows when no file skeleton is
included as the second argument. In FoxPro for Macintosh version 2.6a, if no
file skeleton was used and a folder was specified in the second argument, ADIR()
would return the number of files in that folder. In FoxPro for Windows version
2.6x and in Visual FoxPro (Windows and Macintosh), a zero is returned.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following commands typed in the FoxPro Command window will illustrate the
change in behavior. For these commands, it is assumed that the Visual FoxPro
samples folders are installed. If using these commands in FoxPro 2.6, substitute
the hard drive name or drive letter and folder or directory path to where Visual
FoxPro is installed for the HOME() function. For instance "Macintosh
HD:Microsoft Visual FoxPro:" on the Macintosh or "C:\VFP\" in Windows.

       DIMENSION farray(1,1)
       SET DEFAULT TO HOME()+"Samples"
       ? ADIR("farray",":Data:")       && If using VFP/Mac
       ? ADIR("farray","Data\")        && If using VFP/Win

In Visual FoxPro and FoxPro for Windows 2.6, the ADIR() functions above will
return a zero. In FoxPro for Macintosh 2.6, they will return a 14, which is the
number of files in the Samples:Data folder.

To have ADIR() return the number of files in the Samples:Data folder in Visual
FoxPro, use the following syntax for ADIR():

       ? ADIR("farray",":Data:*.*")    && If using VFP/Mac
       ? ADIR("farray","Data\*.*")     && If using VFP/Win
