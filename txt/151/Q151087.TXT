SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the icon in the To Set Up The Table Join section, located in the
Lab Exercise "Building A DAO Database Application" (Chapter 12, Lab 2, Exercise
1), you receive a series of messages culminating in the error:

   EMPLOYEE caused an Invalid Page Fault in module KERNEL32.DLL

RESOLUTION
==========

The databases used in this exercise must be copied to your hard drive,
read-write enabled and executed from there.

For more information about how to accomplish these tasks in Windows, see your
Windows printed documentation or online Help.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Mastering Microsoft Visual C++,
version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Chapter 12 lab exercises focus on accessing and modifying database
information. All databases used in these exercises must be read-write enabled.
The database the icon in the section "To Set Up The Table Join" points to a
database that, because it is located on the Mastering Microsoft Visual C++
compact disc, is read-only.
