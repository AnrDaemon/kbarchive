TITLE   :Maintenance Manager Copies Files to Root of NetWare Servers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbMaintMan smsmaintman

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


Novell NetWare servers may stop responding, due to large amounts of root
directory file entries created by the Systems Management Server Maintenance
Manager service.

CAUSE
=====

On NetWare servers, Maintenance Manager places the Maintman.tst file in the root
directory of the volume on which the Logon.srv directory resides. Maintenance
Manager creates and deletes this file on its polling interval.

If the NetWare server does not automatically purge deleted files, the
Maintman.tst files will consume more and more directory entries on the root
directory. If the maximum number of directory entries is reached, the NetWare
server may stop responding.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. This problem was corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
