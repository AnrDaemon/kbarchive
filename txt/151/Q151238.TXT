======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the DCA IRMA Workstation for Windows 3270 emulator over the SNA
Server version 2.0 or 2.1 Windows 3.x client interface, the following event log
entries may be logged to the Microsoft Windows NT application event log:

   Event ID 442, 443, 444, 445, 446

CAUSE
=====

The DCA IRMA Workstation product was originally developed to work with the
DCA/Microsoft OS/2 Communications Server gateway product (the predecessor to
Microsoft SNA Server), and called the internal event logging functions that were
still supported in the SNA Server 2.0 and 2.1 Windows 3.x client binaries. These
logging functions have been disabled if the SNA Server 2.11 Windows 3.x client
binaries are used, so the above events should no longer appear in the Windows NT
application event log.

This article documents the meaning of the above events, and are not documented in
the SNA Server [ASCII 147]Reference Guide.[ASCII 148]

======
