TITLE   :Network Client 3.0 Logon Fails On Token Ring
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Network Client 3.0 for MS-DOS is configured to use NWLink (IPX) only on a
token-ring network, user logons may not be validated by the Windows NT domain.
When you attempt NET LOGON, the following message appears:

   You were logged on, but have not been validated by a server.
   Therefore, you may not have permission to use some network
   resources.

Other network functionality is not affected.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT 3.51 servers enable source routing by default. The network client
does not. Without source routing, when the client requests logon validation, the
server responds, but the client ignores the server response.

RESOLUTION
==========

To enable source-routing on the client, add the following entry to the
[MS$NWLINK] section of the protocol.ini file: Source_Routing=16. The section for
an IBM 16/4 ISA token-ring network interface card (NIC) is:

   [MS$NWLINK]
   FRAME=TOKENRING
   DriverName=nwlink$
   BINDINGS=MS$IBMTR4
   Source_Routing=16

Additional query words: source routing token ring nwlink logon
