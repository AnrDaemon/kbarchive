TITLE   :Using Server-Based User Profiles w/ Citrix Winframe
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to log on with a user profile on a Windows NT Server running
Citrix Winframe, you may get the following error:

   Unable to log you on because you do not have security access to the
   information inside your mandatory profile.

Normally, this error would mean that you had not been granted access to the
profile in User Profile Editor. However, with Winframe installed, you may get
this error even though you have the appropriate access.

RESOLUTION
==========

With Winframe installed, user profiles must be kept in a share called Profile.
If the profiles are kept in any other share, you may get the error mentioned
above. The appropriate entry in User Manager for profile path is:

   \\servername\Profile\mandatory.man

where servername is the computer name of the server where the profiles are
stored, and mandatory.man is the name of the profile assigned to the user.
