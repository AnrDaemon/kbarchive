Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.


If an invalid password or user name is passed to the Command Line, Visual
SourceSafe does not return an error message that can be detected. The Command
Line prompts the user to enter a new password. This causes a problem when the
Command is included in an application because the control does not return to the
file, and the process does not complete. The Sslogin DLL allows you to check the
user name before calling the Command Line functions. Once the user name and
password are validated, then the programmer may call the Command Line.

The Sslogin.dll takes three parameters:

   Username (case insensitive)
   Password (case insensitive)
   Path to the UM.DAT file

The DLL returns an integer value representing the success or failure of the
operation.
