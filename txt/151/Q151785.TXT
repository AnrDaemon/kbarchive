TITLE   :XCON: MTA Queue Blocked by NDR or Delivery Receipts
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An Exchange Server site that backbones over a foreign X.400 system to another
Exchange Server site develops a message backlog for mail destined for the remote
Exchange Server site. This message backlog is unrelated to any network
communication problems. The message delivery problem may be unidirectional; that
is, messages are being delivered from the remote site, but not to the remote
site.

CAUSE
=====

If a report message (that is, a non-delivery report [NDR], or a delivery
receipt) is returned from the remote site and the foreign X.400 system used as a
backbone adds unanticipated encoding for the property Report- Additional-Info,
the message may block the MTA queue.

STATUS
======

version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
