   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

If 3270 Printer LUs are assigned to a computer using the LocalLUs parameter, the
printer LU names are improperly displayed as 3270 Display LUs when viewed in a
3270 Emulator.

CAUSE
=====

The LocalLUs parameter was not designed to support printer LUs.

RESOLUTION
==========

A new parameter called LocalPrinterLUs has been added to provide the capability
of assigning printer LUs to a computer. If this parameter is present on a SNA
Server client, the printer LUs in the User/Group record are replaced with the
printer LUs specified in the LocalPrinterLUs parameter. The LocalPrinterLUs
parameter supports a maximum of 10 printer LUs.

The LocalPrinterLUs parameter is specified as follows:

Win3x Clients
-------------

 - Add the following entry to the [WNAP] Section of the WIN.INI file:

   LocalPrinterLUs=<PrinterLUName1> <PrinterLUName2>
   ...<PrinterLUNameX>

   where <PrinterLUNameX> are LU names separated by spaces.

Windows 95 Clients
------------------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

 - Run the Registry Editor (REGEDIT), and locate the following key:

          HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
              SOFTWARE
                  Microsoft
                      SnaBase
                          Parameters

 - Add the following string value to the Registry key:

   String Value Name: LocalPrinterLUs
   Data: <PrinterLUName1> <PrinterLUName2> ... <PrinterLUNameX>

   where <PrinterLUNameX> are LU names separated by spaces.

 - Close the Registry Editor.

Windows NT Clients
------------------

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

 - Run the Registry Editor (REGEDT32), and locate the following key:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
         SYSTEM
             CurrentControlSet
                Services
                   SnaBase
                      Parameters

 - Add the following value to the Registry key:

   Value Name: LocalPrinterLUs Data Type:  REG_SZ
   Data:      <PrinterLUName1> <PrinterLUName2>
   ...<PrinterLUNameX>

   where <PrinterLUNameX> are LU names separated by spaces.

 - Close the Registry Editor.

The following files have been updated to add the support for the new
LocalPrinterLUs parameter:

   Win3x Clients: <winroot>\System\Wdmod.dll
   Windows 95 Clients: <winroot>\System\Snadmod.dll
   Windows NT Clients: <snaroot>\System\Snadmod.dll

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.0, 2.1,
2.11, and 2.11.sp1. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA
Server 2.11 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

The LocalLUs parameter is used to specify the LUs to be used on the system,
regardless of which user is logged on. If this variable is not used, SNA Server
assigns LUs based on the User/Group records defined in SNA Server Admin.
Reference to Appendix C of the SNA Server "Reference Guide" for more details on
the LocalLUs parameter.

For additional information on how SNA Server currently handles assigning LUs to a
computer, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
