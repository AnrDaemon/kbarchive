TITLE   :XADM: "Reps-From" USN Too High for One Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Exchange Server administrators may find that newly created objects
(for example, recipients) on one server have not replicated to other servers
(within a site or between sites), even though a reasonable period of time has
passed for replication to have occurred.

The total recipients count (in the lower left corner of the Microsoft Exchange
Server Administrator program window) may remain consistently less than that of
other servers in the site. Also, users may find that an address is not available
in the Global Address List.

CAUSE
=====

The "Reps-From" update sequence number (USN) count on the server not taking
replicas from the replicating server has been incorrectly advanced to a value
higher than the current USN issued by the target server's directory service.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. The first step in troubleshooting these symptoms is to positively diagnose
   whether the server's tardy replication is caused by either the problem
   described in this article or the one in the article Q152942, "XADM: Slow
   Intra-site Directory Replication Between Servers." These conditions are rare.


2. If you are sure that a server maintains a higher "Reps- From" USN than the
   highest USN assigned by the that server, do one of the following:

   a. If the high "Reps-From" count is between two replication bridgehead
      servers in a multi-site Microsoft Exchange Server organization:

   Redefine one of the other servers in the site lacking replicas as the
   replication bridgehead for the site.

      If the server is a single-server site:

   Delete the replication connector and the other site object(s) associated with
   this replication connector (in both sites). Allow the delete to complete, and
   then reconfigure the directory replication connector.

   b. If the high "Reps-From" count is between two servers within a site,
      Re-install the server harboring the high "Reps-From" count into the site,
      following the steps documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article
      Q162353, "XADM: Restoring an Exchange Directory."
