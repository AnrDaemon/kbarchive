======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you install the Microsoft Mail Connector onto a Microsoft Exchange Server,
it will create a compatible Microsoft Mail for PC Networks PostOffice database.
The Serial Number for this PostOffice will be 22- 28798.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you attempt to connect two Microsoft Exchange Servers, using the Microsoft
Mail Connector as your backbone, you will get the following error in the Event
Viewer when starting the PC MTA Service:

   The Microsoft PC MTA service returned service specific error 3

The Event log will contain the following entries:

   Event ID: 4188
   Source : Microsoft PC MTA
   Type : Error
   Category: Session
   Description:
   The postoffice NET/PO on \\computername\sharename and the postoffice NET1/PO1
   on \\computername1\sharename1 have the same postoffice serial number
   [22-28798].

   Make sure you do not have two drives pointing to the same postoffice.

Where NET/PO is one Microsoft Exchange Server, NET1/PO1 is another Microsoft
Exchange Server, and \\computername\sharename is the MAILDAT$ share for the
Microsoft Exchange Server PC Mail database.

Microsoft does not recommend using the Microsoft Mail Connector as a backbone for
Microsoft Exchange Servers. Setting up the Microsoft Mail Connector is discussed
in more detail in the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator's Guide, Chapter
9.
