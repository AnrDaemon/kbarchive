TITLE   :Trap 0x50 and Trap 0xA Under Heavy Stress
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

Trap 0x50 and 0xA occur as network connections are being torn down. The traps
appear to be timing-related issues. The stackback trace should have routines
contained in Afd.sys. These traps occurred under very high-stress conditions.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem occurs on Compaq multiprocessor computers and appears to be a
synchronization issue processing through AFD. In one instance, a trap occurred
while processing the same IO Request Packet (IRP) a second time. The IRP data
was no longer valid and the associated memory had been freed. In a second
instance, the failure occurred while a TCP receive indication on an aborted
connection was being handled.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
