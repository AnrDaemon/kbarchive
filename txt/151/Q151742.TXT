KEYWORDS:kbmm kbsetup kbnokeyword kbBug kbISS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSPRESS Mastering Microsoft Exchange Development ISBN 1-57231-337-4, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Mastering Exchange Development, the last two dialog boxes in
the install process appear slightly too short for the title. Specifically, the
last "t" in the word Development is partially obscured. The two dialogs are the
Registering Components Dialog and the Installation complete dialog.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs when the screen resolution is set to 800x600 or higher.

RESOLUTION
==========

Changing to a screen resolution of 640x480 corrects this and allows all the text
to be seen normally.

For more information about how to this task in Windows, see your Windows printed
documentation or online Help.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed above. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
