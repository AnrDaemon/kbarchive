PCMCIA Token Ring adapter on an IBM Thinkpad 760, the adapter may not be
detected by Microsoft Windows NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows NT PCMCIA device driver does not support the IBM 16/4 Token Ring
CCA, IBM 16/4 Token Ring CCA/II, or the IBM Auto 16/4 PCMCIA Token Ring
adapters.

the IBM PCMCIA Token Ring Device Driver. The following files are available from
IBM and may be helpful in using the adapters:

   TRCC.ZIP IBM   PCMCIA Token Ring Device Driver
   UTTP1WNT.EXE   Thinkpad NT Utility Diskette
   TPWINNT1.TXT   Thinkpad General Instructions for NT
