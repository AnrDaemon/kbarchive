TITLE   :Do Not Install Active Desktop on Terminal Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you perform a standard installation of Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01
with Active Desktop, restart the Terminal Server computer, and log on, the
computer stops responding (hangs) or displays a blue screen. Little more than
the Start Menu and Task Manager can be available.

If you remove the Active Desktop component, the problem is resolved for users
logging on at the console but Terminal Server clients may receive the following
error message:

   Cannot access this file. Path is too long.

If you click OK, the client session ends.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, remove Internet Explorer and reinstall it without
the Active Desktop component. Follow these steps to remove Internet Explorer:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

   NOTE: It may take a long time for Control Panel to open after you click it.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

3. Select Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0, and then click Add/Remove.

4. Remove Internet Explorer.
