SUMMARY
=======

This article briefly explains the differences between superscopes and
supernetting and gives examples of when to use each.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DHCP Superscoping is used when you need to assign non-supernetted or non-
consecutive IP address subnets to the same physical segment. For example, if you
needed to assign 199.1.1.x and 201.2.2.x addresses to the same physical network,
you could use superscopes or if you needed to assign 199.1.0.x and 199.1.1.x and
did not want to change the subnet mask to support supernetting.

For more information, please see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

   ARTICLE-ID: Q161571
   TITLE : Using DHCP "Superscopes" to Serve Multiple Logical Subnets

Supernetting is used when multiple, consecutive network addresses of the same
Class are combined into blocks. For example, if you need to assign 199.1.1.x and
199.1.2.x to the same physical network and want to change subnet mask. You would
use the subnet mask of 255.255.254.0 and NOT use DHCP superscopes to assign
addresses from DHCP server.

Additional query words: supernet superscope
