TITLE   :3C509 Is Not Autodetected During Setup on ThinkPad 760EL & XL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT on an IBM ThinkPad 760EL or XL, along with a
SelectaDock II docking station and a 3COM 3c509 card, autodetection of the
network adapter fails.

CAUSE
=====

The cause is that the SelectaDock II docking station has a new PCI-to-PCI bridge
that uses I/O address 100-110, which is also the default address of the 3C509
card. When the detection software does not see a 3C509 card at I/O address
100-100, it assumes there are no cards in the computer and does not continue
looking for them at different addresses.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
