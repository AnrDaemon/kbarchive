PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Exchange Backup or NTBackup to restore a
DLT2000/4000/7000 tape to a local or remote disk at network speed of 100
megabits per second or higher, the Windows NT computer may receive the following
error:

   STOP: 0x0000000A (7fff0000 00000002 00000000 80176524)

The problem is seen only on multiprocessor systems, but it may occur on single
processor systems also.

CAUSE
=====

During a high throughput DLTxxxx restore operation (that is, backup- dedicated
servers), the computer may receive a stop error. This error is caused by a
divide overflow in the Tcpip.sys function, TDIQueryInformation.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
