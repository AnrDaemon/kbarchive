SYMPTOMS
========

When the 'Snap To' option of Intellipoint 2.2 is in effect, you may observe a
difference in behavior with Visual Basic 5.0 applications running under Windows
95, Windows 98, and Windows Me versus Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000.

Under Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Me, the mouse pointer moves to the
Command button with focus when its parent form gains focus. There is no cursor
movement under Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000; this is considered the correct
behavior.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Basic 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The function of the Intellipoint 'Snap To' option is to place the mouse cursor
over the default Command Button on a window, if any, when that window acquires
focus. Visual Basic 5.0 is not designed to support this Intellipoint
functionality.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Make certain you have Intellipoint 2.2 installed on your Win95 or Win98
   computer. Open the Windows Control Panel and double-click the Mouse icon.
   When the dialog box appears, you should see four check boxes. Make certain
   that the upper-left checkbox is selected, and then exit the dialog box.

2. Create a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

3. Add at least two CommandButtons to Form1. Add instances of several other
   different controls for variety.

4. Set the Default property of one of the CommandButtons to True.

5. Click Add Form on the Project menu to add a second form to your project.

6. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form1:

         Option Explicit

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            Form2.Show
         End Sub

7. Run the program.

8. Note which control has the focus. Click a command button if one does not have
   focus. Click on Form2 and then press the ALT-TAB key combination to give
   Form1 the focus. The cursor will be positioned over the command button which
   has the focus.

9. Click a control other than one of the command buttons. Press the ALT-TAB key
   combination to shift focus from Form1 to Form 2. Press the ALT-TAB key
   combination again to shift focus back to Form1. The mouse cursor has been
   moved to the center of the default command button.
