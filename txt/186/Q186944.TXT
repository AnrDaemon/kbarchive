TITLE   :XWEB: Some Messages Sent From Contact List Are Undeliverable
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


Sending mail to a contact's Internet mail address using the Outlook Web Access
(OWA) client can result in the mail being returned as undeliverable.

CAUSE
=====

If the Internet e-mail address was originally saved as a Contact using an
Outlook 97 client, the OWA client will not be able to use it. If the Internet
e-mail address was originally saved as a Contact using an Outlook 98 client, the
OWA client can send to it. This is due to the format in which each Outlook
client saves the Internet address. Outlook 97 saves the address enclosed in
square brackets (example: Test User[testuser@test.com]) and Outlook 98 will
saves the address in it's current format (example: "testuser@test.com"). The
brackets surrounding the address cause the message to be undeliverable.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, create the contact manually or use Outlook 98.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
