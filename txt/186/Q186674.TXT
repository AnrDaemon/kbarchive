SYMPTOMS
========

If you have Remotely Possible/32 installed on your computer running Windows NT,
you may experience one of the following errors when restarting.

   STOP: C0000143 (MISSING SYSTEM FILES)
   The required system file Display_driver.dll is bad or missing.

-or-

   STOP: 0x0000001E (0xC0000005, 0xA0036FC2, 0x00000000, 0x00000004)
   KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED address 0xA0036FC2 in Win32K.sys

NOTE: Actual address may vary for Win32k.sys.

CAUSE
=====

The STOP C0000143 error can occur if one of the following files is corrupted or
deleted:

 - Rp32ntvx.dll (where x = 1-6, Rp32ntv1.dll through Rp32ntv6.dll)

 - Vga.dll

The STOP 0x0000001E error can occur if the Remotely Possible/32 Logonrem.dll file
is corrupted or deleted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Install Windows NT 4.0 into a parallel installation.

   For information on how to modify the registry of a secondary installation and
   disable services, refer to the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

   Article-ID: Q165748
   Titled : How to Disable a Service or Device that Prevents NT from Booting

2. Use Regedt32 to change the following registry entries in the failing Windows
   NT %systemroot%\system32\config\system hive by following these steps:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
3. Run Regedt32 and load the System hive from the failing Windows NT
   installation. NOTE: This key will be called TEST in the steps below.

   ControlsetXXX represents the controlset that your failing computer should boot
   from then next time it is restarted based on the CURRENT:Reg_Dword:0xY value
   found in the SELECT key.

   a. In the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\TEST\controlsetXXX\services\RP32Service key,
      change the value of Start:REG_DWORD: to 0x4.

   b. In the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\TEST\controlsetXXX\services\RP32Spin key, change
      the value of Start:REG_DWORD: to 0x4.

   c. In the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\TEST\controlsetXXX\services\RP32SWire key,
      change the value of Start:REG_DWORD: to 0x4.

   d. In HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\TEST\controlsetXXX\services\vgasave key, ensure
      ImagePath reads \Systemroot\system32\drivers\vga.sys.

   e. In the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\TEST\controlsetXXX\services\vgasave \device0
      key, change InstalledDisplayDrivers from rp32ntv1 to VGA. NOTE: The above
      registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

4. Select the TEST hive, and then click Unload Hive from the Registry menu.

5. Load the Software hive from the failing Windows NT
   %systemroot%\system32\config\ folder.

   NOTE: This key will also be called TEST in the steps below.

   a. Double-click the new TEST key and follow this path:

      Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version\Winlogon

   b. Modify the entry Ginadll:REG_SZ:logonrem.dll to Msgina.dll

6. Select the TEST hive, click Unload Hive from the Registry menu, and then exit
   Regedt32.

7. Copy the Vga.sys file (found in %systemroot%\system32\drivers) from your
   parallel installation to the original installation of Windows NT.

8. Copy the Msgina.dll and Vga.dll files (found in %systemroot%\system32) from
   the parallel installation to the original installation of Windows NT.

9. Shut down and restart your computer in your original Windows NT installation.

This will allow you to boot back into the operating system, but you will be in
VGA mode until the entry for the computer's actual video driver XXX name is
modified if Rp32ntv1 is corrupted or missing:

In the following key, change InstalledDisplayDrivers from rp32ntv1 to vga:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\services\XXX\device0

MORE INFORMATION
================

Normally, if a standard Windows NT system file is deleted or corrupted and
prevents the operating system from restarting, we can perform a system repair
using an emergency repair disk (ERD).

The ERD contains a file called Setup.log, which has CRC information for each
Windows NT system file installed. When we choose to "verify Windows NT system
files" during a repair process, any file that is missing or whose CRC value does
not match the value stored in the Setup.log file will be replaced from the
original Windows NT setup compact disc.

Unfortunately, Remotely Possible's setup program does not add entries into the
Windows NT Setup.log file for a repair process to work, so other means of repair
are necessary.

The third-party products discussed here are manufactured by vendors independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
