TITLE   :RPC Server Unavailable When Joining a Domain with NETDOM
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Window NT 4.0 Resource Kit Supplement III includes a command line utility
called NETDOM (v 1.7) that allows the administrator to join a domain from a
command prompt.

The command line can be run locally on the workstation or also remotely. The
following error message may appear when NETDOM tries to query domain information
on the workstation remotely:

   The RPC server is unavailable.

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused because the administrator of the domain does not have
administrative access on the workstation (recall that the passwords are
different).

The following scenario leads to the problem:

1. The domain is DOMAIN and the PDC is DOMAINPDC.

2. Install a Windows NT Workstation as \\DOMAINMEMBER in a workgroup.

3. Make sure the workstation administrator account password and domain
   administrator account passwords are different.

4. On the PDC, log on as the administrator and send the following command line:

   NETDOM /DOMAIN:DOMAIN MEMBER \\DOMAINMEMBER /JOINDOMAIN

   The output is as follows:

   Searching PDC for domain DOMAIN ...
   Found PDC \\DOMAINPDC
   Querying domain information on PDC \\DOMAINPDC ...
   Querying domain information on computer \\DOMAINMEMBER ...
   The RPC Server is unavailable.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use one of the following workarounds:

 - Before giving the NETDOM command, connect to the workstation with
   administrative access:

   NET USE \\DOMAINMEMBER\IPC$ /USER:DOMAINMEMBER\ADMINISTRATOR password

 - Run NETDOM locally (that is, on the workstation).
