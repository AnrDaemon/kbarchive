-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to record a macro with a name that contains a Multi-Byte
Character Set (MBCS) character, an error appears.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use only single-byte characters to name a macro.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++ .NET.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A Developer Studio macro is a Visual Basic Scripting Edition subroutine that
contains VBScript commands and takes no parameters. The macro begins with a Sub
statement, continues with VBScript commands that automate tasks in Developer
Studio, and ends with an End Sub statement.

A macro needs a name before you record it or write it manually. When complete,
the macro is stored in a text file known as a macro file (.dsm).

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. On the Tools menu, click Macro.

2. If a message box appears, click OK.

3. In the Macro File list, select a macro file. If no macro file exists, click
   Options, and then click New File.

4. In the Macro Name box, enter a new name for the macro. Use at least one MBCS
   character.

5. Click Record.

   Note: You cannot record a macro that already exists or record to a file that
   is read-only.

An error dialog appears indicating the macro name is invalid.
