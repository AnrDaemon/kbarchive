PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Internet Connection Wizard does not configure Connection Manager for
Internet Service Provider (ISP) Signup.

CAUSE
=====

Some of the fields needed in the INS file are missing, and therefore the
Internet Connection Wizard (ICW) does not know it needs to configure the
Connection Manager.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, add or modify the following fields in the INS file
as follows:

      [ClientSetup]
      Done_Message
      <The message you want to display to the user at the end of signup
      here.>
      Explore_Command
      <The page you want to take the user to at the end of signup here.
      For example: http://www.microsoft.com>

      [Custom]
      Run=icwconn2.exe

      [Custom_Dialer]
      Auto_Dial_DLL=cmdial32.dll
      Auto_Dial_Function=_InetDialHandler@16

      [Entry]
      Entry_Name=<This has to match the name of your Connection Manager
      profile.>

Also make the following changes in the Template.cmp file, located in the CMAK\ENU
directory, and rebuild your profile using CMAK:

      [Connection Manager]
      RememberPassword=1

Additional query words: connection manager cm cmak
