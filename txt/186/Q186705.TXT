TITLE   :XCLN: Explore Web Page Fails Opening FTP Address
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Pack 1 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


In Microsoft Outlook, you can open a contact's Web page by clicking Explore Web
Page from the Actions menu, or by clicking on the address in the Web Page
Address box.

However, if you try to do the same thing in Outlook Web Access and the specified
address begins with "ftp," Outlook Web Access attempts to open the address with
"http://" instead. This may cause the operation to either attempt to open a
different Web address than the one specified, or fail if that address does not
exist.

CAUSE
=====

If Outlook Web Access does not see a protocol specifier (a colon) on the Uniform
Resource Locator (URL) listed in the Web Page Address box, it defaults to use
"http://".

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Outlook Web Access
version 5.5 Service Pack 1.
