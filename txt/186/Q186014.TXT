-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Quick View utility shipped with Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0
cannot preview files created in any of the Microsoft Office 97 programs.

This article describes how you can modify the options in Windows Explorer so that
you can use the Microsoft Word Viewer 97-2000 to preview files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows Explorer lets you customize the items in the shortcut menu that appears
when you right-click a file. For those file formats that cannot be opened in the
Windows Quick View utility, you can use Word Viewer to preview files using Quick
View.

Before you use the following procedure, download and install Microsoft Word
Viewer 97-2000. Word Viewer 97-2000 is contained in a self-extracting .exe file
called Wd97vwr32.exe on the Microsoft World Wide Web site. For additional
information about obtaining and installing Word 97-2000 Viewer, please see the

   Q165908 WV: How to Obtain Microsoft Word Viewers

After the Setup program has completed, Word Viewer 97-2000 is listed on the
shortcut menu when you right-click a file that has a .doc or file extension or
WordView file type.

To change the shortcut menu so that Word Viewer is started when you click Quick
View on the shortcut menu, follow these steps:

1. On the Windows Start menu, point to Program, and then click Windows Explorer.

2. On the View menu, click Folder Options, and then click the Files Types tab.

3. Under Registered File Types, select Microsoft Word Document, and then click
   Edit.

4. In the Edit File Type dialog box, follow these steps:
   a. Click to clear the Enable Quick View option.

   b. Under Actions, click WordView, and then click Edit.

   c. Select the path and file name listed in the "Application used to perform
      action" box, and press CTRL+C to copy it to the clipboard. Click Cancel.

5. In the Edit File Type dialog box, follow these steps:
   a. Click New.

   b. Under Action, type "&Quick View" (without the quotation marks). The
      ampersand (&) indicates that the following letter (in this case Q) can
      be used as a shortcut key to run the command.

   c. In the "Application used to perform action," press CTRL+V.

   d. Click OK.

6. In the Edit File Type dialog box, under Actions, select WordView and then
   click Remove. When you are prompted to remove WordView from the menu, click
