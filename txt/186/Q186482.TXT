SUMMARY
=======

When NETDDE starts in Windows NT Server or Windows NT Workstation, NETDDE
registers the computer name on the network with the NetBIOS designation of
[1fh]. To register this name for use by NETDDE, the computer name must be
unique. This is normally not a problem because computer names must be unique in
any case. However, NETDDE in Terminal Server registers as [1fh] with the user
name rather than the computer name. This makes sense because all the users
connected to the Terminal Server will use the same computer name, making NETDDE
impossible. However, registering NETDDE with the user name introduces a new
requirement that all users on the network use unique user names if NETDDE is
going to be used. If NETDDE is not used, this should not be a concern. Users who
use the Terminal Server client to connect to multiple sessions will find that
NETDDE will only start in the first session if they try to use the same user
name for multiple sessions.
