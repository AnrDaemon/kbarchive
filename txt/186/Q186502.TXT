TITLE   :Using Blinking Cursors with Terminal Server

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Blinking cursors cause unnecessary bandwidth use because every blink requires
data packets to be transmitted. Applications that do not use a blinking cursor
or that allow the blinking cursor to be disabled are preferred.

A blinking cursor on the remote client session will cause continuous
client/server traffic. This may not be a problem in many environments, but if
connections are made over, for instance, a dial-on-demand router, excessive line
charges can be incurred.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft recommends slowing or eliminating blinking cursors on Terminal Server
Clients to reduce network bandwidth usage.

To adjust the cursor blink rate, perform the following steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
   double-click Keyboard.

2. Move the slider to the left to decrease the Cursor Blink Rate. Moving the
   slider to Slow will stop cursor blinking.
