TITLE   :NetBEUI May Hang When Using Arcnet Under Heavy Network Traffic
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When using NetBEUI on an Arcnet network, the NetBEUI protocol may stop
responding (hang) after a period of high network activity occurs. The computer
has to be restarted to recover from this condition.

CAUSE
=====

NetBEUI keeps a cache of NDIS packets. This means that NetBEUI can send the same
packet multiple times. The problem is that NDIS is not clearing out the timeout
status bit in the packet descriptor. NDIS maintains a counter that runs about
every two seconds. The first pass of the timer, it will set this timeout status
on the first packet in the packet queue. The second time the timer runs, it
checks to see if this bit is set. If it is, NDIS will reset the adapter. Because
NDIS is not resetting the timeout status, a reset of the adapter could occur.
There is also a problem with reset recovery that would cause the protocol to
stop responding.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
