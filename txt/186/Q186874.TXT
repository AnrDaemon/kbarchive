TITLE   :Using NWConv to Migrate Users That Already Exist in Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Migration Tool for NetWare (NWConv.exe) to migrate users that
already exists in the Windows NT account database from Novell NetWare to Windows
NT, changes to group memberships are merged during the migration instead of
being replaced. This occurs even though the Overwrite with New Info option is
selected.

CAUSE
=====

The "Overwrite with New Info" option does not properly overwrite existing group
memberships.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "Overwrite with New Info" option properly overwrites other user- specific
properties that are migrated, including logon hours and security on files and
directories. However, if no user-specific rights exist on a file or directory on
the NetWare server, after migration the Windows NT rights for that file or
directory are preserved. Security settings on files or directories are only
overwritten when the file or directory exists on both servers for the specified
user.
