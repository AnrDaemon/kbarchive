IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

If you have .dll files with special dependencies that require these files to be
loaded before other Web server processes, you can create a registry-defined list
of those .dll files that are to be preloaded into Inetinfo.exe before any other
Web Server services begin.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To preload .dll files, create a new registry value called PreloadDlls using the
following steps:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Start the Registry Editor. (From the Start menu, point to Run, and then type
   "Regedt32.exe" {without the quotation marks.)

2. Locate the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Inetinfo\Parameters

3. Highlight the Parameters key. From the Edit menu, choose Add Value. Enter
   PreloadDlls as the Value Name, define the data type as MULTI_SZ, and then
   click OK.

4. In the Data box of the Multi-String Editor, add data consisting of the names
   of the .dll files that you want to preload (separated by carriage returns).
   If the files reside in the same path, you can type just the name of the .dll
   file. If the .dll file resides in another directory, type the file name and
   its full path. Finish by clicking OK.
