======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On the computer running Internet Information Server (IIS), attempting to delete
a file from an FTP site's directory causes a lock error, and the file cannot be
deleted. To work around this problem, stop and restart the Inetinfo process. To
do this, use the Internet Service Manager (ISM) to stop and then restart all
services under Internet Information Server for that computer.

CAUSE
=====

A client was using FTP to download the file when the download was interrupted.
As a result, the lock the system placed on the file during the download was
never removed.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server 4.0.

STATUS
======

This problem was corrected in Internet Information Server 5.0.

Additional query words: mmc remove inetinfo.exe akz
