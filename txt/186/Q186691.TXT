SYMPTOMS
========

Inbox Assistant (Rules Wizard in Outlook 98) rules can be created to reply to
the sender of a note. However, if the sender of the note is using an Outlook
client and sets an alternate recipient with the "Have replies sent to" option,
the Inbox Assistant rule will not send the reply to the alternate recipient.

CAUSE
=====

The Inbox Assistant rule looks at the MAPI properties of the incoming note to
determine what address to reply to. The MAPI property used by the rule for
replies is the PR_SENDER property, instead of the PR_REPLY_RECIPIENT_NAMES
property, which would contain the alternate recipient's address.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
