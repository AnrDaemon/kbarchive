SUMMARY
=======

Many screen savers monopolize system resources. In a Windows Terminal Server
environment, a screen saver activated on the server or on a Terminal Server
Client can monopolize server resources to an extent that makes it appear that
other clients are hung. For this reason, Microsoft recommends that screen savers
not be used on Windows Terminal Servers or within Terminal Server Client
sessions. If a screen saver is required, choose the Blank Screen screen saver or
another non-intensive screen saver that you have verified using Performance
Monitor.
