TITLE   :PRB: Jet ODBC Driver Error 40002: Operation Invalid at This Time
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using RDO and transactions against the Microsoft Access ODBC driver results in
the following error message:

   Run-time error '40002':

   S1011:[Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access 97 Driver]Operation invalid at this
   time

CAUSE
=====

The ODBC driver does not support transactions on a connection that has open
Resultsets. The Resultset must be opened and closed within the scope of the
transaction.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are three resolutions:

1. Choose a different back-end database whose ODBC driver does not have this
   limitation.

2. Use DAO instead of RDO.

3. Rewrite the code to avoid this limitation.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Access ODBC driver does not preserve cursors across transaction
boundaries. This means that open Resultsets must be closed before entering or
exiting the scope of a transaction. This is a limitation in the design of the
ODBC driver.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Use the ODBC Administrator in the Control Panel to add a DSN called NWIND for
   the Microsoft Access ODBC driver pointing to the Northwind sample database.

2. Create a standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

3. Add a Project Reference to Microsoft Remote Data Object 2.0.

4. Add a CommandButton (Command1) to the default form.

5. Add the following code to the form:

         Option Explicit

         Private Sub Command1()
         Dim cn As rdoConnection, rs As rdoResultset, SQL As String
           Set cn = RDOEngine(0).OpenConnection("NWIND", rdDriverNoPrompt, _
                                                False)
           SQL = "SELECT * FROM Customers"
           Set rs = cn.OpenResultset(SQL, rdOpenKeyset, rdConcurRowVer)
           cn.BeginTrans
           rs.Edit
           rs!ContactTitle = "Vice President"
           rs.Update
           cn.CommitTrans
           rs.Close
           cn.Close
         End Sub

6. Run the project and click the CommandButton. The error above will be
   displayed.

7. Move the "cn.BeginTrans" line before the "Set rs =" line, and move the
   "cn.CommitTrans" line after the "rs.Close" line. Re-run the code and it will
   complete without the error.
