SUMMARY
=======

 

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click Start and then click Run, Windows NT Server 4.0 remembers the
last command that was entered. Terminal Server 4.0 does not.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. If commands were remembered, the same command would
be remembered for all users.
