PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0 SP2,3.0 SP3,4.0,4.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are configuring an SNA Server 3270 print session with the command line
utility Snacfg.exe, FEEDIGNOREFINAL is presented as a valid print session
option. The option may be turned off and on without effecting print output.

CAUSE
=====

This option was included in Snacfg.exe but never implemented in the SNA Print
server.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0 SP
2, 3.0 SP 3, 4.0, and 4.0 SP 1. We are researching this problem in the SNA
Server version 3.0, and will post more information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following

MORE INFORMATION
================

This option is not needed. SNA Print Server ignores the last Form Feed in the
print data stream. When printing with GDI, SNA Print calls EndDoc() to end a
print job. This function adds a Form Feed therefore, an extra page may result if
not ignored. When printing with a printer definition file (PDF) this is not the
case, SNA Print calls EndDocPrinter(), which does not issue a Form Feed,
however, the END_JOB macro usually contains a Form Feed and can be removed if
two Form Feeds are in the data stream to avoid an extra page from being printed.
