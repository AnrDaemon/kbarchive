SUMMARY
=======

All users need to have a fixed home directory and a drive letter assigned to
that directory.

Create a directory called TeamLink in each user's home directory. Users should
already have a WINDOWS subdirectory in their home directory. If not, create
one.

Install TeamLinks (these notes are based on version 2.7) using the CHANGE USER
/INSTALL method or the Add/Remove Programs Control Panel tool.

NOTE: If you run the CHANGE USER /INSTALL command before installing, be sure to
run the CHANGE USER /EXECUTE command after installing.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A file called Tlcvtvu.ini will be created in the SystemRoot. This file will need
to be modified for each user. Check this file for correct user
settings/directories. Copy this file to the WINDOWS subdirectory of the user's
home directory.

Another file called Office.ini will also be created in the SystemRoot. It too
will need to be modified for each user. The file should contain the correct user
logon name and a path to the user's .PAB file (for example,
F:\Teamlink\A1mailpb.dat, where f: is the drive assigned to the user home
directory).

Create an empty file called A1mailpb.dat in the TEAMLINK subdirectory of the
user's home directory.
