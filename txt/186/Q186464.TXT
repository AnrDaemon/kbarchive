PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

You are unable to add the NetBEUI protocol to a Windows NT computer. Instead,
you get the following error:

   Registry Service Subkey already exists.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is because of corrupted registry entries. These entries can become
corrupted by an incomplete installation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the problem follow the directions below:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

1. Back up the registry.

2. Remove the following entries in the Registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CCS\Services\NBF
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CCS\Enum\Root\Legacy_NBF

3. Restart the computer.

4. Install NetBEUI.

NOTE: Removing these additional keys requires manipulation of the rights on those
keys. The default rights for Everyone is READ. To change the rights, log on as
Administrator, take ownership of the keys, and then give Full Control to
Everyone (NOTE: You may need to select Replace permission on existing subkey).
