SUMMARY
=======

Remote management and diagnostics allow a systems administrator to maintain a
network of computers from a remote location and to isolate and resolve system
problems as they occur - without having to visit the individual desktop. In
today's widely distributed networks, remote management capability is key to
efficient systems management and is crucial in any effort to reduce the total
cost of ownership.

Microsoft understands that end-to-end systems management is a huge topic. This
white paper does not attempt to cover all aspects of management, but instead
describes the remote troubleshooting and diagnostics capabilities of Microsoft
Windows NT Server and Windows NT Workstation. This paper discusses tools
included in Windows NT 4.0, the Windows NT Resource Kits, and various Microsoft
add-on packages, including Microsoft Systems Management Server. Note that this
document does not provide extensive procedures for using these tools, but
instead describes situations where these tools are used remotely to accomplish
specific objectives.
