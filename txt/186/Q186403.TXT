======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article summarizes the process that you can use to generate a Package
Definition File (PDF) from a package that was created manually in Systems
Management Server Administrator.

This is useful if you need to add the following line

      SynchronousSystemExitRequired = TRUE

to an existing package or if you would like to easily regenerate the package at a
later time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Obtain the Writepdf.exe file. This file is included in the Systems Management
Server Resource Kit, which is available for download from the Microsoft Web site
at

   http://www.microsoft.com/smsmgmt/.

This utility will create a generic PDF from the information entered in the
package setup.

Usage
-----

   writepdf.exe <sqlserver> <sqlaccount> <password>
   <database> <package_id>

Examples
--------

   writepdf.exe sqlsvr2 sa secret sms sms12345

   or

   writepdf.exe sqlsvr2 sa "" sms sms12345

NOTE: If the SQL account password is blank or contains one or more spaces, place
it within quotation marks.

This will generate a PDF file with the package_id as the name in the current
directory.
