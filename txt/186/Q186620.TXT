SUMMARY
=======

The AREVFIX command is a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program that prevents
Advanced Revelation 3.1 for MS-DOS from using all the CPU in the system. The
default MS-DOS keyboard polling detection does not prevent Advanced Revelation
from trying to use all the available CPU in the system. Before running Advanced
Revelation, run AREVFIX in the MS-DOS window in which you will run Advanced
Revelation. An Advanced Revelation .pif file can be set up to point to a custom
Autoexec.nt file that automatically runs AREVFIX before running Advanced
Revelation. Use DOSKBD to modify MS-DOS keyboard polling detection.
