TITLE   :100 Percent CPU Usage with RCMD or REMOTE
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Running the PMON Resource Kit utility under a remote command session (RCMD or
REMOTE) leads to 100 percent CPU usage at the server. About 50 percent of the
CPU is used by Csrss.exe and the other 50 percent by PMON. This issue may occur
when using VI or many other utilities.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is not caused by PMON and is not caused by the RCMD service but
rather is a combination of the two utilities.

RESOLUTION
==========

The recommended method of resolving this issue is to use the Remote Console
resource kit utility. This utility does not redirect standard input and standard
output but polls video memory changes in order to forward them to the client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT version
4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Remote Command server (RCMDSVC) only redirects standard input and output to the
client so that RCMD clients are not able to see output of programs that work
directly with video memory, such as EDIT, PMON and so on.

Indeed the problem can be reproduced on one hand with any remote shell solution
that redirects standard input and output, and on the other hand with any tool
that works with an other active screen buffer. Console applications may create
several screen buffers (CreateConsoleScreenBuffer() API) and change the current
active buffer (SetConsoleActiveScreenBuffer API).
