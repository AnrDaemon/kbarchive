TITLE   :XFOR: Performance Issues after Installing Chat Server Extension
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After implementing chat-specific server extensions to a chat server, the chat
server's performance may decline, or it may stop responding altogether. Such
server extensions were developed using the Microsoft Exchange Chat Service
Software Development Kit (SDK). This kit is available with Exchange Server 5.5
Service Pack 1 (SP1) or with Microsoft Commercial Information Server (MCIS) 2.0.

CAUSE
=====

Implementing a chat server extension that has not been fully tested into a
production environment can result in a decrease in chat server performance. In
some cases, the chat server may stop responding completely.

WORKAROUND
==========

It is recommended to test any decrease in performance by first temporarily
removing any manually-created chat server extensions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Exchange Chat Service in Exchange Server 5.5 SP1 and MCIS 2.0
include two sample server extensions, Channel Transcription, and Profanity
Filter. Activating any server extensions on the chat server will result in some
decrease in server performance. The sample server extensions that were shipped
with Microsoft Exchange Chat Service were thoroughly tested for optimized
performance. Consequently, they may only cause minimal decrease in performance.

Using the Microsoft Exchange Chat Service SDK, you have the ability to develop
your own server extensions.
