======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Installing Terminal Server is nearly identical to installing Windows NT Server
4.0. Terminal Server shares the same Hardware Compatibility List. This article
discusses setup differences.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Terminal Server supports upgrades from Citrix Winframe 1.6 and 1.7 only. It is
important that you know that there is no upgrade path from any version of
Windows NT Server or Windows NT Workstation to Terminal Server. Unless you are
upgrading from Citrix Winframe, you must perform a new installation.

NOTE: In Citrix Winframe 1.6, some Winframe-specific user information was stored
in the registry, rather than in the accounts database. This changed in Citrix
Winframe 1.7, where user information was stored in the OEM fields in the
security account manager (SAM) file. Terminal Server's additional user
information is also stored in the OEM fields in the SAM. Citrix provided a
utility for Winframe 1.6 users called CNVRTUC to convert registry information to
the SAM file. This utility MUST be run on the Winframe 1.6 Server before
upgrading to Terminal Server.

CNVRTUC - Convert Terminal Server User Configuration
----------------------------------------------------

Usage: cnvrtuc [/ALL | /USER u] /DOMAIN d

   Where your options are the following:

      /ALL - Convert all registry-based user configurations
      /USER u - Convert registry-based user configuration for user 'u'
      /DOMAIN d - Convert user configuration in Domain 'd'

If no options are specified, this message is displayed. This utility migrates
non-replicated, registry-based user configuration entries to the replicated SAM
database.

Several OEM versions of Winframe exist. Microsoft supports upgrades from Citrix
Winframe 1.6 or 1.7 only. Upgrades from the following OEM versions of Winframe
may or may not work and will not be supported by Microsoft:

 - NTRIGUE
 - WINCENTER
 - WINDD

TCP/IP is a required protocol. Other protocols may be installed too, but TCP/IP
must be installed. During network setup, TCP/IP is selected automatically and
the selection is unavailable.

Sysdiff and Unattended Installation
-----------------------------------

You must install applications and run sysdiff while the server is in Install
Mode. To run Terminal Server in Install Mode, type the following command at an
MS-DOS command prompt:

   CHANGE USER /INSTALL.

To exit Install Mode, type the following at an MS-DOS command prompt:

   CHANGE USER /EXECUTE.
