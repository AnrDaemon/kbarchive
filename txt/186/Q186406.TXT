TITLE   :SMS: Drive Letter Selection for SMS Client Files Inconsistent
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup smssetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the client files are installed by using the Systems Management Server
client setup executable (for example, CLI_DOS, CLI_NT), the drive with the most
free space is used.

However, if client setup is invoked by using Invwin32 to install the Systems
Management Server client on a logon server, for example, the same logic does not
apply.

If the administrator adds servers through the Systems Management Server
Administrator's Site Properties, Site Configuration Manager installs the logon
server directory tree to the drive specified in the user interface (UI), but the
client setup process may place the client files on another drive.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
