TITLE   :XCLN: Exchange Client Won't Print Meeting Requests & Messages
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0 5.0SP1 5.0SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Exchange Windows 95 client and you select multiple
meeting requests and multiple mail messages and attempt to print them, the
following message may appear:

   "The item(s) could not be printed. The printer spooler could not print
   the end-of-file character. The file may be corrupted. See your
   administrator."

This usually happens when the option to start each item on a separate page is
selected in the Print dialog box.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, print the items individually. Alternatively, select
multiple items that are the same type. For example, select multiple meeting
requests. Another workaround is to upgrade the client to Outlook.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange Windows
95 client versions 5.0, 5.0 SP1, and 5.0 SP2. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
