SUMMARY
=======

If you need to disable connectivity to the Terminal Server, you have several
options. Note that disabling connectivity for Terminal Server Clients is
different from disabling normal user connectivity. For non-client connectivity
you can pause or stop the Net Logon or Server services in Control
Panel/Services. However, the Terminal Server service cannot be paused, stopped,
or disabled.

To disable Client connectivity, you can:

1. Stop connectivity to the Terminal Server at the command prompt with the
   Command, "Change Logon /Disable." You can re-enable connectivity with "Change
   Logon /Enable."

-or-

2. Stop connectivity to a specific socket connection in Terminal Server
   Connection Configuration under Connection/Disable. This is the same action as
   opening the connection and selecting Logon/Disabled under the Advanced
   Configuration.

-or-

3. Stop connectivity for a user or group to a specific socket connection in
   Terminal Server Connection Configuration under Security/Permissions.

-or-

4. Stop connectivity for a specific user in User Manager by opening the user
   account and selecting CONFIG. Here you can uncheck the box, "Allow Logon to
   Terminal Server." If you modify the user's domain account, the user will not
   be able to connect to the domain from ANY Terminal Server. The other options
   are specific to the Terminal Server on which they are set.
