======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You are running Windows NT 4.0 on a computer using one of these ATI Rage- based
video cards:

 - XPERT@PLAY

 - XPERT@WORK

 - All-In-Wonder

 - 3D PRO TURBO

 - 3D PRO TURBO PC2TV

 - 3D XPRESSION+ & 3D XPRESSION+ PC2TV

 - 3D CHARGER

You have installed pcANYWHERE32, but on the reboot, Windows NT 4.0 displays a
blue screen error. You can boot by selecting "VGA Mode only."

In some situations, the computer may boot correctly, but CTRL+ALT+DEL and file
transfers do not work.

CAUSE
=====

pcANYWHERE 8.0 requires 8514a.dll to be loaded to work with these video drivers.

RESOLUTION
==========

The driver installation file, Ati.inf, that ships with the ATI Rage video card
contains an error; it installs two video drivers into the system registry, but
only copies one of the associated .dll files into the WinNT\System32 folder.

There are two ways to resolve this issue. You can perform both procedures from
either the MS-DOS prompt or the VGA mode in Windows NT.

Solution One
------------

Follow these steps to replace the file:

1. Expand the resource file 8514a.dll from the Windows NT 4.0 CD.

2. Move this file to the WinNT\System32 folder.

3. Reboot the computer.

4. If you were able to boot into Windows NT 4.0 before this procedure, reinstall
   pcANYWHERE32 to disable the fault-tolerant boot mode.

Solution Two
------------

Follow these steps to reinstall the video driver:

1. Uninstall pcANYWHERE32 version 8.0.

2. Manually edit the Ati.inf file.

3. Locate the [ati.Display] section and add in a reference to 8514a.DLL.

   The modified [ati.Display] section should read as follows:

   [ati.Display]
   ati.dll
   8514a.dll

4. Save the Ati.inf file.

5. Right-click the desktop and select Properties.

6. Click the Settings tab.

7. Click Display Type.

8. Click Change.

9. Click Have Disk and point to the Ati.inf file that you modified in step 3.

10. Complete the wizard. You may be required to provide the Windows NT 4.0
   CD-ROM.

11. Reboot the system.

12. Reinstall pcANYWHERE32 version 8.0.
