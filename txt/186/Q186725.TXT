TITLE   :WD97: Leading Spaces and Tabs Removed with Inserted Database
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word97 kbmerge

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Word removes leading spaces and leading tabs from your data records
when you insert or merge an external database. In contrast, Word does not remove
leading spaces when the data source is created in Word.

CAUSE
=====

By design, Word removes leading spaces and leading tabs from external
databases.


WORKAROUND
==========

Use either of the following methods to add the missing spaces to your merge
document.

Method 1: Insert Extra Spaces
-----------------------------

Insert extra spaces in the main document. These extra spaces should immediately
precede the appropriate merge field.

Method 2: Create a Conditional Merge Field
------------------------------------------

Create a conditional merge field to include spaces. The following merge field
example will insert five spaces if {mergefield name} equals John.

      {If {mergefield name} = "John" "     "}

The following merge field will insert five spaces and the result of the
{mergefield name} in your document:

      {If {mergefield name} = "John" "     {mergefield name}"}

Additional query words: merge database datasource data source records leading spaces blank
