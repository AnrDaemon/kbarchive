The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 97, versions 8.0, 8.01, 8.02, 8.03 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you compose a new appointment or meeting request in a calendar that is
located in a public folder, if you check the option for a reminder, a reminder
is not generated. Instead, the following message is displayed:

   The reminder for XXX's appointment will not appear because the item is
   not in your calendar or tasks folder. Is this OK?

The reminder does not notify you of the meeting or appointment.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because public folders are not specific to any one user or profile, there is no
one for the reminder to remind. To receive reminders to specific appointments or
meetings, use your mailbox calendar to make appointments and schedule meetings.
