TITLE   :Periods Appear as Commas Using Belgian Dutch Keyboard
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use a Belgian Dutch keyboard or many other European keyboard layouts with
any program, the period character from the numeric keypad appears on the screen
as a comma.

RESOLUTION
==========

This behavior is by design as of Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3). Because
the period on the keypad is meant to be the decimal separator and because many
European countries use the comma as the separator, the keypad's period was
modified to display as a comma.

You can replace the Kbdbe.dll file with the version that is included with Windows
NT 4.0 Server or Workstation if you prefer the period rather than the comma.
After replacing the file, you need to restart your computer to load the DLL file
file.
