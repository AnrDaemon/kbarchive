TITLE   :XCON: MTA Associations Fail On MSCS Installation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Exchange Server as a messaging bridgehead on a Microsoft
Cluster Server (MSCS) installation, the MTA may fail to read the virtual IP
address correctly. This causes the incorrect IP address to be utilized for
attempted connections, and MTA associations fail.

CAUSE
=====

In this scenario, the clustered configuration consists of two nodes that share
one or more common physical disk drives, an IP address, a network name, and the
Microsoft Exchange Server cluster resource. All network requests to the
clustered Microsoft Exchange Server computer are directed at the virtual server
defined by the cluster, not at an individual node. It is the active node that
receives and processes these requests on behalf of the cluster. The MTA fails to
properly initialize a variable for the cluster API, which prevents correct usage
of the virtual IP address assigned to the clustered resources.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
