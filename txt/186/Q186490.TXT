TITLE   :Terminal Server's Use of "Access This Computer From Network"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order for a client to log on to a Terminal Server computer, the user
must belong to a group that has the right to log on locally to the server.
The right to access the computer from the network is not required to log on
to a Terminal Server computer across the network from a client. For greater
security, an administrator can use User Manager to remove the group
Everyone from the right "Access this computer from the network" for
Terminal Server computers installed as stand-alone or member servers. Doing
so allows only those with administrative accounts and administrative rights
to connect to a Terminal Server computer using shares or administrative
tools.

Note that you should not make this change if a Terminal Server computer is
installed as a domain controller because rights set on any domain
controller apply to every domain controller. Removing the right to access
this computer from the network would prevent all network users from
accessing network resources.
