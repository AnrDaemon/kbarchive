TITLE   :Terminal Server Client Error 193
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A non-administrator user tries to log on through the Terminal Server Client, and
receives the following error:

   An error (193) occurred while creating user logon. Failing component:
   explorer.exe.

When the user clicks OK, the client terminates.

CAUSE
=====

The user does not have access to Explorer.exe. The cause is most probably that
the administrator has turned on the administrative utility, Application
Security, but has not added Explorer.exe to the list of allowed applications.

RESOLUTION
==========

At the Terminal Server, the administrator can add Explorer.exe to the list of
authorized applications. To do this, run the Application Security application
and choose ADD. Browse for the application or enter the path (which is
drive:\systemroot\explorer.exe).
