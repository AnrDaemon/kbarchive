TITLE   :SMS: One Hour Delay for Mandatory Time w/Mandatory After Option
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.2 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a job in the System Management Server Administrator program and
set the Mandatory After option to a specific time (for example 5/1/1998 3:00PM),
Package Command Manager (PCM) in the System Management Server client will
receive the job and display the mandatory time for a one hour delay (in the
example, 5/1/1998 4:00PM).

This problem occurs when both of the following conditions are true:

 - You have installed System Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 3.

   -and-

 - You are using Microsoft Windows 95 client.

This problem does not occur if you are using a Microsoft Windows NT Workstation
4.0 client with System Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 3.

Note that this problem does not relate to time zone in either the server or the
client. This means that it occurs even if your client and server are using the
same time zone and the system times are synchronized.

WORKAROUND
==========

Manually adjust the mandatory time in the job's properties to one hour earlier
than the time you need.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 1.2 Service Pack 3. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
