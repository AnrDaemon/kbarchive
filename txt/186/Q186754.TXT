TITLE   :XWEB: No Send Again Button on NDRs in OWA Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Pack 1 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When you open a non-delivery report (NDR) in the Outlook Web Access client, you
will not have a Send Again button as you do in the Outlook and Exchange clients.
You will only see the NDR information. Your original message text will not
appear in the message; the normally attached note is not available from the
Outlook Web Access client.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you want to re-send the note, open the NDR inside the Exchange client or
Outlook client, and click Send Again. Otherwise, you will have to open your Sent
Items folder, find the original message, and then forward the note to the same
address or a new address.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
