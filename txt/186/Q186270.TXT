======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Studio versions 97, 97sp2, 97sp3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a Visual Basic form, an OLE control is placed on a Microsoft Tabbed Dialog
control. You write code to embed a file into the OLE control using the
CreateEmbed method. When the user clicks the tab that contains the OLE control,
one of the following errors occur and the application terminates:

   VB5 caused an invalid page fault in module TABCTL32.OCX at 0137:212f8b26.

-or-

   <Project Name> executed an invalid instruction in module OLE32.DLL at
   0137:65fa93ae.

-or-

   Exception: Access violation (0xc0000005), Address: 0x212f8b26

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Place the OLE control inside a Frame control.

   -or-

 - Make the Tab that contains the OLE control the active tab before using the
   CreateEmbed method.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default. Choose
   Components from the Project menu and add a reference to the "Microsoft Tabbed
   Dialog Control 5.0."

2. Add an SSTab control to Form1. By default, there will be three tabs named
   Tab0, Tab1 and Tab2. Add a CommandButton to Form1.

3. Add an OLE control to the first tab, Tab0, of the SSTab control. Choose
   Cancel when prompted to insert an object.

4. Paste the following code into the code window of Form1:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
           'Set the current tab to the second tab
           SSTab1.Tab = 1

           'Embed a bitmap into the OLE control
           OLE1.CreateEmbed "C:\VB5\Graphics\Bitmaps\Assorted\Envelope.bmp"
         End Sub

5. Change the path in the code above to a valid BMP file on your system.

6. Save and run the project.

7. Click Command1. Click Tab0 and note that the OLE control displays the bitmap
   file.

8. Click Command1 and then click Tab0.

Note that Visual Basic terminates with one of the errors mentioned above. If no
problem occurs, repeat steps 7 and 8. If the problem still does not occur, try
restarting Visual Basic and repeat the steps beginning at step 6. This problem
also occurs when running the project as a compiled .exe file.

Workaround
----------

To work around this problem, put a Frame control on Tab0 and then put the OLE
control inside the Frame control. Size the Frame control so it is large enough
to accommodate the OLE control and set the Borderstyle property of the Frame
control to 0 if you wish to hide the Frame's border and caption.
