SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Systems Management Server, you can use Rservice to remotely install
Package Command Manager (PCM) as a service on Windows NT-based systems. Rservice
uses the browse list to enumerate potential computers for service installation.
Rservice does not enumerate a computer that is not in the browse list, and will
not install PCM as a service on it.

It is important to note, however, that using Rservice with the /M switch allows
you to specify a computer rather than depending on the browse list.
