SUMMARY
=======

The Splash Screen Foundation Class included in Visual FoxPro for Windows 6.0
provides a simple Splash screen for use in applications.

This article demonstrates how to call the Splash Screen using program code.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Splash Foundation class has properties that you can change at run-time. The
properties that you will most likely use the most include picture, label
caption, and duration.

The Picture property is the background picture that displays like wallpaper on
the form. The Caption property of the label is the message presented to the
user, and Duration property determines how long, in seconds, the form appears to
the user. If you do not want a picture, do not set this property.

Sample Code
-----------

      * Calls _Splash from _Dialogs and set properties for form.
      * Adjust the path to the class library and picture as needed.
      osplash=Newobject("_splash",Home()+'ffc\_dialogs')
      osplash.Caption="Splash Screen Test"
      osplash.Autocenter=.T.
      osplash.Picture="d:\vfp98\ffc\graphics\clock.bmp"
      osplash.Label1.Fontname="arial"
      osplash.Label1.Fontsize=24
      osplash.Label1.Width=150
      osplash.Label1.Backstyle=1
      osplash.Label1.Forecolor=RGB(255,0,0)
      osplash.Label1.Backcolor=RGB(0,0,128)
      osplash.Label1.Top=100
      osplash.Label1.Left=120
      osplash.Label1.Caption="Welcome"
      osplash.nduration=2 && Set the duration.
      osplash.Show
