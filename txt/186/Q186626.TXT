SUMMARY
=======

Citrix Winframe 1.6 and earlier versions stored user account information
specific to Winframe sessions in the registry. This meant that the information
would not replicate, even if the Winframe server was a domain controller. Citrix
introduced a utility called CNVRTUC, to convert registry information into the
security account manager (SAM) database, so that the user information could be
replicated. Windows Terminal Server uses the SAM for user information by
default, although CNVRTUC is included with Terminal Server to facilitate
upgrades from Citrix Winframe 1.6. This could raise concerns about the SAM in a
domain environment. Concerns include how the user accounts database on Terminal
Server is different from the SAM on other non-Terminal Server domain
controllers. Also, there could be a concern about whether the SAM will properly
replicate, and whether or not it is structurally different from non-Terminal
Server SAMs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Citrix Winframe and Terminal Server make use of optional fields that were built
into Windows NT Server user account databases. These fields were included to
allow software developers to add special features to Windows NT without making
structural changes that might be detrimental to "normal" user account databases.
If data exists in these fields, it is replicated through the domain, making it
available wherever users might log on.

So, although Terminal Server makes use of these optional fields in the SAM, the
user accounts database is not structurally different from copies of the SAM on
other domain controllers, member servers, or standalone servers. Terminal Server
(and Citrix Winframe) are fully compatible with Windows NT Server 3.51 and 4.0
SAMs.

However, since Terminal Server user accounts will normally have more data, the
individual record sizes in the SAM will be larger. This should be considered in
capacity planning. In Windows NT Server, a single user account consumes from 1
through 4 KB of space. Here are the possible sizes for Terminal Server accounts.
The actual sizes you see will depend on how much data you include in each
account. These figures are not exact. They are intended to demonstrate the range
you might see on your Terminal Server.

1. A simple user: just a username, password, no descriptions or full names:
   approximately 1K.

2. A complex user: adding the maximum amount possible on every available input
   line for names, passwords, paths to home directories, and so on, can increase
   the size to 8 KB per user.

3. Global groups add about 4 KB (the same as Windows NT Server).

4. Local groups add about 1 KB (the same as Windows NT Server)

If you install a Terminal Server as a primary domain controller (PDC), or as a
backup domain controller (BDC), you can expect to see much larger account sizes
and a much larger SAM than on Windows NT Server domain controllers. As with
Windows NT Server, Microsoft recommends that the SAM be no larger than 60 MB for
a single domain. This may mean that you want to create a separate domain for
your Terminal Servers. If you want users to use any of the special attributes
found in Terminal Server User Manager, the users' logon accounts must be
modified. This means that if Terminal Server is in a separate domain, that
domain needs to be a master accounts domain, rather than a resource domain.

Another consideration, even if Terminal Server plays only a member server role in
your domain, is to use Terminal Server's User Manager to manage the domain.
Again, because Terminal Server makes use of optional fields, and cannot
distinguish between Terminal Server and non-Terminal Server user account
databases, if you manage your non-Terminal Server domain accounts (focusing on
the PDC) from the Terminal Server, you will create accounts that are somewhat
larger than normal. If this is a consideration in your domain, do not use
Terminal Server's User Manager to manage domain user accounts.

However, if you want to use any of the special configuration options available in
Terminal Server's User Manager, you must manage your accounts from a Terminal
Server. That Server can be a member server, or a domain controller, in your
accounts domain. It could also be a server in a trusted or trusting domain, if
the Terminal Server's global administrators group has been added to the local
administrators group in the accounts domain. Normal security considerations
apply to Terminal Servers in resource or accounts domains.
