TITLE   :Error 80004005 Occurs When Retrieving Data from SQL Server
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0,6.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft SQL Server version 6.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using Active Server Pages (ASP) to retrieve data from a Microsoft SQL
Server database, the following error occurs:

   Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error '80004005'
   [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][DBNMPNTW]ConnectionWrite
   (GetOverLappedResult( )).

WORKAROUND
==========

If SQL Server is running on the same server as Internet Information Server
(IIS), use a local named pipe connection instead of a network named pipe
connection.

In the SQL Server connection string, DSN configuration, and Global.asa file,
change

      SERVER=<computername>

to:

      SERVER=(local)

MORE INFORMATION
================

The name "(local)" (with parentheses, but without quotation marks) is a special
keyword recognized by the SQL Server ODBC driver; it indicates that a local
connection should be used.

Additional query words: fetch structured query language source dsn akz
