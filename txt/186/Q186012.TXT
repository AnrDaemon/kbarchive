SUMMARY
=======

This article is a pointer to a white paper available for download. The white
paper titled "Creating Certificate Hierarchies with Microsoft Certificate Server
Version 1.0" describes how to use Microsoft Certificate Server version 1.0 and
certification authority hierarchies with Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5
Service Pack 1.

As noted in the Microsoft Windows NT Option Pack release notes, Microsoft
Certificate Server 1.0 does not officially support certification authority
hierarchies. However, several of the key capabilities of a certification
authority hierarchies feature do work and can reasonably be used in an
implementation with Exchange Server to achieve most of the desirable
characteristics of certification authority hierarchies.
