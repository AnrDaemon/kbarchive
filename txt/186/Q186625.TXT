======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Many applications expect only one user to use the application at a time. In a
multiuser environment like Terminal Server, Dynamic Link Libraries (.dll files)
may fail to open if more than one user attempts to use them. The REGISTER
utility allows you to tell the system that a particular .dll file should be made
available globally to the system and to all users.

Note that registration data for a program is recognized only when the program is
loaded. Therefore, if you issue a REGISTER command for a program that is already
loaded, the changes will not take effect until the next time the program is
loaded.
