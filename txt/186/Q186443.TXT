TITLE   :XWEB: Large Out of Office Message Causes Client to Stop Respondi
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Pack 1 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Outlook Web Access client, if you paste a very large
message into the Text area of the Out of Office dialog box, the computer may
stop responding. Eventually, a blank window appears. If you try to close the
window by clicking the X in the upper-right corner of the window, the window
will close, but none of the other functions of the client, such as viewing
messages, will work.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do not paste a large amount of message text into
your Out of Office text box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Your pointer will display an hourglass shape, which will eventually turn into a
blank window, or if you add a large Out of Office text, a message will appear
that says the operation timed out. You may also see a script timeout message.
