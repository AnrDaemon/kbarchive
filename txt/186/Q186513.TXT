SUMMARY
=======

DISCONN disconnects a session.

Syntax
------

disconn [sessionname] [/server:servername] [/v] [/?]disconn [sessionID]
[/server:servername] [/v] [/?]

Parameters
----------

sessionname
Identifies the session. The name was created by the system administrator when the
session was configured.

sessionID
Specifies the ID of a session.

/server:servername
Specifies the Terminal Server. Otherwise, the current Terminal Server is used.

/v (verbose)
Displays information about the actions being performed.

/? (help)
Displays the syntax for the command and information about the command's options.

DISCONN -- Additional Notes
---------------------------

If no ID or name for the session is specified, disconn uses the current session
ID. If you specify the name of the session, it must identify an active session.

Any processes associated with the session ID continue to run in the background.
DISCONN is not the same as logoff, which terminates all processes associated
with the session ID. Sessions running at the system console cannot be
disconnected.

DISCONN -- Examples
-------------------

To disconnect the current session, type:
disconn

To disconnect from a specific session, for example session 10, type:
disconn 10

To disconnect from the session TERM04, type:
disconn TERM04
