TITLE   :FIX: DBCombo BoundText Incorrect When Setting Text Property
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Studio versions 97, 97sp1, 97sp2, 97sp3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When setting the DBCombo Text property to a new value that exists in the
database, the BoundText property is not updated to hold the contents of the
BoundColumn for the record.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Basic 6.0 with the
Microsoft Bound Data List Controls 6.0.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The DBLIST32.OCX control that ships with Visual Basic 4.0 returned the BoundText
properly in this situation. It is possible that the Visual Basic 5.0 version of
DBLIST32.OCX could break an application built with Visual Basic 4.0 when the
DBLIST32.OCX control is upgraded.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

These steps use the BIBLIO.MDB sample database that ships with Visual Basic.

1. Start a new Standard EXE Project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Place a data control (Data1) on Form1. Set the DataBaseName property to
   BIBLIO.MDB. Set the RecordsSource to the Authors table.

3. From the Project menu, choose Components. Add the "Microsoft Data Bound List
   Controls" to the project.

4. Add a DBCombo control (DBCombo1) to the form. Set the RowSource property to
   Data1. Set the BoundColumn to AU_ID. Set the ListField to Author.

5. Add a CommandButton (Command1) to Form1. Add the following code to the Click
   event of Command1:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            DBCombo1.Text = "Curry, Dave"
            MsgBox DBCombo1.BoundText
         End Sub

6. Save and run the project.

7. Click the CommandButton and note that a blank message box pops up. It should
   have popped up with the AU_ID corresponding to the Author "Curry, Dave."
