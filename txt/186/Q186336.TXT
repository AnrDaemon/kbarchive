TITLE   :INFO: Unattend.txt Options That Are Used During an Unattended Up
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSBK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

An unattended upgrade from a previous version of Microsoft Windows NT to
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 ignores most parameters commonly set in the
Unattend.txt answer file. The upgrade installation automatically reads the
registry of the system being upgraded for system configuration information and
uses those values during the upgrade. It is not possible to override or replace
the existing system configuration information with an unattended answer file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

During an unattended upgrade, only the following parameters in the unattend
answer file are used. If NtUpgrade = yes, all other options in the answer file,
if specified, are ignored.

   [Unattended]
   OemPreinstall = Yes
   NoWaitAfterTextMode = 1
   NoWaitAfterGUIMode = 1
   NtUpgrade = Yes
   OverwriteOemFilesOnUpgrade = Yes

   [UserData]
   ProductId = "xxx-xxxxxxx"

   [GuiUnattended]
   OemSkipWelcome = 1


NOTE: During an upgrade installation, if OemPreinstall is set to YES, the $OEM$
directory structure is copied to the local hard disk, but the directory
structure is not used during the installation. Any options specified in a
Cmdlines.txt file are ignored. Windows NT Setup recognizes and uses the $OEM$
directory structure only if NtUpgrade is set to NO in the Unattend.txt answer
file. Most options commonly applied with a Cmdlines.txt file can still be
applied during the unattended upgrade by specifying the winnt/winnt32
command-line switch /e. The /e switch allows Setup to run an external program at
the end of GUI-mode Setup. This option can be used to apply a service pack or to
start other custom applications during Setup. For additional information about
the /e command-line switch, please see Chapter 5 of the Windows NT Deployment
Guide.
