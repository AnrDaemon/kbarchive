 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

NW2NT - While this is not strictly a command line utility, it is unique to
Terminal Server and can be run from the command line. NW2NT is used to give
selected NetWare users access to the Terminal Server.

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools (Common), and
   click NetWare User Access for Terminal Server.

2. Click Server to open the Select NetWare Server dialog box.

3. In Select Server, click a NetWare server, and then click OK.

4. In Username, type the name of an administrator for the NetWare server, and in
   Password, type the password. User names configured for the NetWare server
   appear in the NetWare User Access for Terminal Server dialog box.

5. In From, select the users to whom you want to give access to the Terminal
   Server, and then click Add. The names you selected will appear in To. Users
   listed in From cannot access the Terminal Server.

6. Click Apply to save all the changes you have made without closing the dialog
   box.

NOTES: If you want to grant NetWare users access to the entire domain, you must
run this program from a Windows NT domain controller. If you run this program on
a server on the domain that is not a domain controller, you can grant NetWare
users access only to that specific Terminal Server. You can give access only to
users from NetWare 3.x servers. At this time you cannot give access to users
from NetWare 4.x servers (unless the NetWare server is set to Bindery
Emulation).

For more information, see the Services for NetWare Networks manual and Books
Online.
