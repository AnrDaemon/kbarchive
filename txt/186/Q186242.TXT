Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a program that contains the following code and run the program:

         USE home()+"samples\data\customer"
         MODIFY  STRUCTURE
         INDEX ON cust_id TAG cust_id DESCENDING
         MODIFY STRUCTURE
         ALTER TABLE customer ADD PRIMARY KEY cust_id TAG cust_id
         MODIFY  STRUCTURE

2. When the first Table Designer window appears, click the Indexes tab and note
   both the Order and Type for the Cust_id tag. The Indexes tab name is Index in
   Visual FoxPro 3.0. Click OK.

3. Overwrite the Cust_id key when the warning message appears. Click the Indexes
   tab on the Table Designer window, noting that the Cust_id key is now a
   regular index type in descending order. Click OK.

4. Overwrite the Cust_id key again when prompted. Click the Indexes tab of the
   Table Designer window. The Cust_id key is now a primary index key, but it is
   in ascending order.
