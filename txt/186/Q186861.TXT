TITLE   :BUG: Install Wizard Cannot Distinguish Between MIPS CPUs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbToolkit kbVBp500bug kbVBp600 kbOSWinCE100bug kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install a Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 program created with
the Application Install Wizard, certain devices might hang.

This problem has been reported with some devices that use the Phillips PR31700
chipset, and may occur on other devices that use the MIPS 3900 processors. The
following devices might be affected:

 - Compaq C-Series 810
 - Compaq C-Series 2010c
 - Philips Velo 1
 - Philips Velo 500
 - Sharp Mobilon HC-4100
 - Sharp Mobilon HC-4500

CAUSE
=====

The CE Services Application Manager and the VBCE Application Install Wizard
cannot distinguish between MIPS processor versions. Both the 4000 (1K) and 3000
(4K) options use the line "ProcessorType=4000" to indicate that a program should
be downloaded and installed on the device. If the files for the wrong CPU are
installed, the device may hang.

RESOLUTION
==========

Create separate installation programs for each MIPS processor. Add information
to your program's installation instructions indicating that the MIPS 3000 (4K)
setup should be used for the devices listed above.

If any device hangs during installation, a large .cab file may remain in the
\Windows\AppMgr\Install folder. This file should be deleted.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

WARNING: The following steps cause your CE device to hang.

1. Create an installation program for both MIPS processors using the VBCE
   Application Install Wizard.

2. Install the program on a desktop computer connected to a MIPS 3000 device
   listed above.

RESULT: The device hangs while trying to decompress the .cab file during
installation because the file for the MIPS 4000 was downloaded.
