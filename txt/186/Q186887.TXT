When you use the Outlook Web Access (OWA) client from a Macintosh computer using
Internet Explorer to send a message in which a recipient is not resolved, the
following error message will appear:

   [Accept These Choices]
   [Cancel]
   All addresses must be resolved before this item can be sent. The address for
   the following recipient(s) could not be resolved. Please choose an action for
   each recipient. If you choose to ignore a recipient, that entry will remain
   unchanged.

   * Recipient_Name has no matches.
   o Ignore this recipient
   o Delete this recipient

In this case, neither Ignore nor Delete options are selected.

If you do not select an option and select [Accept These Choices], the message is
cancelled and not sent.

==========

To work around this problem, you must select either option for each unresolved
recipient, or select cancel, and edit the recipient field(s).
