======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Outlook Web Access (OWA) client, you can move or copy a normal
note (post or send note) from your Inbox to any other folder, including the
Calendar and Contacts folder. If you move a note or post message into the
Calendar or Contacts folder, you will no longer be able to view the note or post
in the OWA client. Opening the mailbox with an Outlook client will allow the
message to be viewed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can move a send or post note into another folder by these following steps:

1. In the Outlook Web Access client select the note and click to open the note
   or post.

2. Click the Move or Copy button from the toolbar in the note.

3. Select the Calendar or Contacts folder, and then select either the Move or
   Copy button.

4. Close the note by clicking the Close button.

5. Go to the Calendar or Contacts folder and you will not see the note that you
   moved.

If you need to see a note or post that you moved into a Calendar or Contacts
folder, use the Outlook or Exchange client to open the item.
