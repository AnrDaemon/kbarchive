TITLE   :SMS Error: Insufficient Privileges to Edit Pending Jobs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a user account to manage only Packages and Jobs, you therefore
restrict the access in Systems Management Server Security Manager to VIEW access
for Sites, and FULL access for Packages and Jobs. When the user attempts to
modify a Pending Job, the following error message may appear:

   You have insufficient privileges to edit or create these objects. To edit
   this data, you need FULL access to the following security objects: SITES and
   SITE GROUPS

WORKAROUND
==========

Give the user FULL access to Sites, Site Groups, Packages and Jobs.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
