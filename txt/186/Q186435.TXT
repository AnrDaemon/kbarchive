TITLE   :WD97: Formatting Lost, Symbols Appear When Opening Document
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a document in Microsoft Word 97, no formatting is displayed, and
square boxes and symbols may be interspersed throughout the document's text.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when the Files Of Type setting (on the File menu, click
Open) is "Recover Text from Any File," so that when you open your document, only
the text is recovered, not any of its formatting.

WORKAROUND
==========

To prevent only text from being recovered when you open your files and to open
your documents in the format of Word documents, follow these steps:

1. On the File menu, click Open.

2. In the Files Of Type list, click Word Documents, or click All Files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "Recover Text from Any File" setting will remain until you change it back to
either Word Documents or to All Files.

the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
