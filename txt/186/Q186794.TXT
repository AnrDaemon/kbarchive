======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to remotely administer the Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0
through the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), the following error message may
appear:

   Unable to enumerate files and directories because the following error
   occurred:

   The network name cannot be found.

CAUSE
=====

The C$ share has been removed from the system. The MMC uses the $ shares to
attach to the remote box and enumerate the files and directories to be displayed
in the interface.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, reshare the drives on the remote server, making
sure the "$" character is added to the end of the drive letter.
