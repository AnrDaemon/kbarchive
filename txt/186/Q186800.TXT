SUMMARY
=======

This article explains the bandwidth throttling feature in Internet Information
Server (IIS) 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The throttler checks measured bandwidth versus max bandwidth every 10 seconds,
not on every request. The throttler works as follows:

1. Every 10 seconds, the throttler:

    - Checks the bandwidth used in the last 60 seconds and compares that to max
      bandwidth.

    - Sets state to BelowLimit if current usage is less than max.

    - Sets state to EqualToLimit if current usage is about equal to max.

    - Sets state to OverLimit if current usage is greater than max.

2. On every I/O request, the throttler:

    - Checks to see whether the state is BelowLimit, EqualToLimit, or OverLimit.

    - Decides whether to allow the request based on the current state and the
      type of I/O requested.

   When the state is BelowLimit, the throttler allows all I/O operations. When
   the state is EqualToLimit, the throttler blocks type V but allows types W, X,
   Y, and Z. When the state is OverLimit, the throttler rejects type V, blocks
   types W and X, and allows Y and Z.

I/O operation types are classified according to the following: V is a read, and
the others are various types of sends. Usually Web server processing includes
reading the request and sending the response. The throttler is more aggressive
about stopping reads, because preventing a read causes fewer responses to be
sent in the future.

On each I/O, the throttler does not attempt to check whether that operation
exceeds the bandwidth limit. Rather, all that is checked is the current state
(below, equal, or over) and the type of operation. When the state is over, all
requests of type V are rejected, and all requests of type W and X are blocked
until the state goes back to equal or below.

Note that the current state only changes every 10 seconds, when bandwidth usage
is checked. On a short time scale (for example, 5 seconds), bandwidth limit may
be exceeded, but on a longer scale (for example, 1 to 2 minutes), bandwidth
should always be near or below the limit.
