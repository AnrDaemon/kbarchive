TITLE   :XFOR: Date Appended to Attached Files Sent to cc:Mail List
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0 5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When an Exchange user sends a message with an attachment to a Lotus cc:Mail
mailing list that includes Exchange recipients, the date is appended to the end
of the attachment name when the message arrives in the Exchange recipients'
mailboxes.

CAUSE
=====

This is a problem in the hrParseFileName() function. This function assumes that
the date following the file name is always in MM/DD/YY format. However, for
dates such as 1/1/98, the format is actually M/D/YY. The parsing algorithm does
not handle these correctly and fails for all dates with a single-digit month or
day with the symptom listed above.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the following fix or wait for the next Exchange
service pack.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.
