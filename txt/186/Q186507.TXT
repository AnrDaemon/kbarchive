KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Beginning with Citrix Winframe 1.7, user configurations were stored in the SAM
with the rest of user information. Prior to version 1.7, the information was
stored in the registry. CNVRTUC is included with Terminal Server for upgrades
from Citrix Winframe version 1.6 and should only be run on that server. This
utility has no function in Terminal Server because, by default, all user
configuration information is already stored in the SAM database. CNVRTUC
converts user configurations from registry-based format to SAM-based format.

Syntax
------

cnvrtuc [/all | [/user username] [/domain domainname]

Parameters
----------

none /all

   Converts all registry-based user configurations.

/user username

   Converts the registry-based user configuration for the specified user.

/domain domainname

   Converts user configurations in the specified domain.

Security Restrictions
---------------------

Only domain administrators can run CNVRTUC.
