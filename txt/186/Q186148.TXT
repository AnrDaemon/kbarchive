TITLE   :PRB: Error 32002 Working with Attachments in MAPI Controls
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error may occur when trying to send a message with multiple
attachments:

   Error 32002: Unspecified Failure

However, the message sends successfully if there is only one attachment.

CAUSE
=====

If the AttachmentPosition property is not set for each attachment, it will
default to 0. Therefore, any attachments beyond the first are overwriting the
Position data for the prior attachment and thereby invalidating all but the last
attachment added.

RESOLUTION
==========

Designate a unique AttachmentPosition for each attachment in the message as
demonstrated in this Visual Basic code sample:

       Sub Main()
          'Logon & Sync
          MAPISession1.SignOn

          'Create Message w/Attachments then Send
          With MAPIMessages1
              .SessionID = MAPISession1.SessionID
              .Compose
              .MsgSubject = "OCX - Test Message"

              .RecipDisplayName = "YourRecipientNameHere"
              .ResolveName

              'The value 2 is passed to the Space() function in the
              'next line because there are two attachments to add.
              'These spaces act as placeholders for the attachments.
              .MsgNoteText = _
                  Space(2) & vbCrLf & _
                  "This message was sent from the MSMAPI32.OCX." & vbCrLf & _
                  "This message contains 2 attachments."

              'Replace the AttachmentPathName values below as applicable...
              .AttachmentIndex = 0
              .AttachmentPosition = 0
              .AttachmentPathName = ("c:\test1.txt")
              .AttachmentIndex = 1
              .AttachmentPosition = 1
              .AttachmentPathName = ("c:\test2.txt")
              .Send
          End With

          MAPISession1.SignOff

       End Sub

MORE INFORMATION
================

To reproduce this issue, comment the two lines in the code sample above that set
the AttachmentPosition value for each attachment.
