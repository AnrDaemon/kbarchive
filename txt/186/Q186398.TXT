SUMMARY
=======

Pdfwiz.exe, available in the Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit, is a Package
Definition File (PDF) wizard. You can use PDFWIZ to make an application easier
to distribute and install with Systems Management Server. When you start PDFWIZ,
it opens a window on your console that has directions for its use.

The window prompts you for various package information, including supported
platforms, whether to inventory a package or not, and so forth. PDFWIZ generates
a PDF that can be loaded into Systems Management Server. Because PDFWIZ does not
require Systems Management Server DLLs, it can run on any computer that is
running Windows. If the Systems Management Server Administrator program is
installed, you may prefer to use it to create the package and then extract the
package from the database by using Writepdf.exe.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PDFWIZ runs on Alpha, MIPS, and x86 hardware.

NOTE: When you specify the platforms on which the files in the PDF can be
installed, find the "Select the operating system on which the deinstallation
command can run" dialog box. This dialog box is incorrectly labeled.
