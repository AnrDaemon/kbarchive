TITLE   :Terminal Server Commands: SHUTDOWN
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

SHUTDOWN allows an administrator to shut down the application server in a
controlled manner. No programs can be executed after shutdown is started. You
can shut down the server safely, or you may decide to reboot the server. The
session of the user who initiated the shutdown is still active, but all
information is read-only.

Syntax
------

shutdown [wait_time] [/server:servername] [/reboot] [/powerdown]
[/delay:delay_time] [/v] [/?]

Parameters
----------

wait_time

   Specifies the amount of time in seconds you must wait after notifying
   connected users before logging off all user sessions.

/server:servername

   Specifies the Terminal Server to shut down. Otherwise, the current Terminal
   Server is shut down.

/reboot

   The application server is rebooted after user sessions are terminated.

/powerdown

   The application server is prepared to shut down. Server-class computers that
   support software control of AC power will shut themselves down.

/delay

   Specifies the amount of time you must wait after terminating all user
   sessions before terminating all processes.

/v (verbose)

   Displays information about the actions being performed.

/? (help)

   Displays the syntax for this command and information about the command's
   options.

Security Restrictions
---------------------

Only administrators can run SHUTDOWN.

SHUTDOWN -- Additional Notes
----------------------------

All connected sessions are notified that they are going to be shut down. Shutdown
waits a specified interval (the default interval is 60 seconds) before resetting
all sessions and logging off all users. Sessions that have applications with
open files will prompt the user to save the files. After initiating the logoff
command, shutdown waits a specified interval (the default interval is 30
seconds; set by /delay) before terminating all processes.

Shutdown does not reboot the application server unless the /reboot option is
specified. The Shutdown Computer option in the Security dialog box does not
notify users before terminating user sessions and is not recommended.
