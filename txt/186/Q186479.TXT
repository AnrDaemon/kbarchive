MIGRATE -- Additional Notes
---------------------------

The migrate command can be used to migrate selected Windows 3.1 settings to a
Terminal Server. If the Terminal Server was installed into an existing Windows
3.1 directory, migration of these settings probably occurred when you first
logged on. This command can also be used to manually migrate settings from other
.ini or Program Group files.
