TITLE   :WD97: ConfirmConversions Doesn't Work with OpenDataSource
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word8 word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When performing a mail merge using the Visual Basic for Applications
MailMerge.OpenDataSource command with the ConfirmConversions argument set equal
to True, the Confirm Data Source dialog box does not appear when you open a data
source saved in a non-Word format.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you can record a macro while confirming the data
source and use the resulting commands in your original macro.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although setting the ConfirmConversions argument to True selects the Select
Method check box option in the Open Data Source dialog box, the Confirm Data
Source dialog box is bypassed when you run the macro. You cannot select a
different method for opening the data source other than the default method of
DDE.
