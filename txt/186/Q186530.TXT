SUMMARY
=======

Typically, the RDP client does not support local devices, such as printers.
However, aside from using Citrix's ICA client to gain this functionality, some
manufacturers are building in services to allow local printing on their RPD
devices.

For instance, the Tektronix WBT supports Line Printer Daemon (LPD) as a separate
process on the device. Any device that supports Line Printer Remote (LPR)
(including Windows Terminal Server or Windows NT Server) can print to this. This
means that administrators can set up a print queue on Terminal Server or Windows
NT Server pointing to the LPD on the Tektronix WBT. A user can connect from the
Tektronix device to the LPR queue and print to the local printer.
