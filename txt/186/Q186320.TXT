PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,5.0,97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Visual InterDev, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When developing a Web with either FrontPage or Visual Interdev, you may want to
know the following:

 - If SourceSafe integration is available.

 - Whether a specific Web is source controlled and the name of the controlling
   project.

 - Find which VSS database the Web is connected to.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Determining if SourceSafe Integration is Available
--------------------------------------------------

   FrontPage: From the Tools menu choose Web settings. If there is no Source
   Control Project field, source control is unavailable.

   Visual Interdev: From the Project Menu, choose Enable Web Source Control, and
   then enter a project name in the "Enable Source Control" dialog box. The
   operation fails and returns an error message if source control is
   unavailable.

Determining if a Web is Source Controlled
-----------------------------------------

   FrontPage: From the View menu choose Folder View. Files that are Source
   controlled have an additional glyph to the left of the file name. A green dot
   for a checked in file, a red check mark for a file checked out to the current
   user, or a padlock if the file is checked out to a different user. The
   controlling project name displays in the Source Control Project field on the
   Configuration tab of the Tools ... Web settings dialog box. If this field is
   empty, source control is not enabled for this Web.

   Interdev: Right-click the Web name in the File View pane and choose
   Properties from the shortcut menu. The Web Server tab of the Properties
   dialog box either displays the controlling project name, or indicates that
   the Web does not have source control enabled.

Finding Which VSS Database the Web is Connected to
--------------------------------------------------

   The Service.cnf file, located in the Inetpub\wwwroot\webname\_vti_pvt folder
   has the following line for a Source Code controlled Web:
   vti_sourcecontrolcookie equals the path to Srcsafe.ini
