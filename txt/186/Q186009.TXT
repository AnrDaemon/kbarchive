TITLE   :PRB: Errors Starting the Coverage Profiler
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When starting the Coverage Profiler application, the following error message
occurs:

   OLE error code 0x.

CAUSE
=====

The Comdlg32.ocx is not present or is an incompatible version for use with the
Coverage Profiler.

RESOLUTION
==========

Listed below are three possible resolutions to this problem.

 - Obtain the correct version of the Comdlg32.ocx and make sure it is installed
   in the \Windows\System or \Winnt\System32 directory, as appropriate.

   -or-

 - Choose Ignore and OK in the error messages. The Visual FoxPro GETFILE()
   dialog box appears allowing a log file to be opened.

   -or-

 - Modify the Coverage Profiler application so it does not use the Comdlg32.ocx.
   The following steps can be used to modify the Coverage.app:

   1. Unzip the XSource.zip file found in the \VFP6\Tools\XSource folder. If the
      Winzip option to Use Folder Names is used, a Coverage directory, along
      with other folders, is created that contains the Coverage Profiler source
      files.

   2. Open the Coverage.pjx project.

   3. Go to the Other tab and expand the Text Files node. Find the COV_TUNE file
      and modify the file.

   4. In the COV_TUNE.h file, find the # DEFINE COV_USE_OCXS .T. line. Change
      the .T. to .F. then save and close the COV_TUNE.h file.

   5. Rebuild the Coverage.app application. Be sure to save the application in
      the Visual FoxPro 6.0 folder or point the _Coverage system memory variable
      to the location of the rebuilt Coverage.app.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Coverage Profiler is a new tool in Visual FoxPro 6.0 that provides
information about the lines of code run in a program. The Coverage Profiler
writes a log file. Issuing the SET COVERAGE TO "somefile.log" command when a
program or form runs creates a log file. You access the Coverage Profiler
application to analyze the log file from the Visual Foxpro Tools menu. However,
there are other ways to start the Coverage Profiler application.

When the Coverage Profiler application starts, if a log file has not specified,
the Open dialog box appears prompting for the name of the log file to open. The
Open dialog box comes from the Comdlg32.ocx and installs with Visual FoxPro.

If, for some reason, the Comdlg32.ocx is missing or is an incompatible version, a
series of error messages occur. Below is a list of the error messages that
occur. Errors 2, 3 and 4 appear when you select Ignore in the first error
message.

Error 1:

   Program Error
   OLE error code 0x.
   <Cancel> <Suspend> <Ignore> <Help>

Error 2:

   Coverage Profiler Problem
   Problem:
   Property CDLCOV_GETFILE is not found.
   getresourcelocation
   <OK>

Error 3:

   Coverage Profiler Problem
   Problem:
   Expression is not valid outside of WITH/ENDWITH.
   getresourcelocation
   <OK>

Error 4:

   Coverage Profiler Problem
   Problem:
   WITH/ENDWITH mismatch.
   getresourcelocation
   <OK>

After choosing Ignore to the first error and then OK on all the others, a dialog
box appears asking what log file to open. This dialog box is based on the Visual
FoxPro GETFILE() function rather than the Comdlg32.ocx.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

To receive the error messages shown above, follow the steps below:

1. Go to the \Windows\System or \Winnt\System32 folder, as appropriate for the
   operating system and copy the Comdlg32.ocx to another folder. Once the
   Comdlg32.ocx is safely backed up in another location, delete the copy in the
   \Windows\System(32) directory.

2. From the Tools menu in Visual FoxPro, choose the Coverage Profiler command.
   The error messages listed above should appear. Choose Ignore on the first one
   error.
