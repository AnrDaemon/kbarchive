TITLE   :Icons Mapped to NetWare Drives Appear/Disappear from Start Menu
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use NetWare logon scripts, you may find that icons mapped to NetWare
drives will appear and disappear from the Start Menu.

CAUSE
=====

The user desktop may appear before the NetWare logon script is completed.

RESOLUTION
==========

One workaround is to create a System Policy that tells the system to run the
complete logon script before continuing to bring up the user desktop. In System
Policy Editor, modify Default Computer (or create specific computer policies if
you do not want this to be a global change) under Windows NT System/Logon. Check
the box "Run Logon Scripts Synchronously." This may resolve the problem.
