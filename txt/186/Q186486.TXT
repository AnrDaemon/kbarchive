SUMMARY
=======

On a computer running Windows NT Server or Workstation, you can register up to
16 names using the NET NAME /ADD command-line utility. However, although
Messenger will receive messages for all registered names, it will only display
messages intended for the logged on user name. Messages for other registered
names are not displayed.

Messenger has been modified to allow 256 registered aliases and messages sent to
any of these aliases will be displayed on the screen. These aliases are per user
so individual users (or user applications) can register and delete these names
(through NET NAME /ADD /DEL) without affecting other users.

Another messaging modification is that all users logged on with the same name or
using the same registered alias will receive messages sent to that name. In
Windows NT Server or Workstation, only the first instance of the name receives
the message.

Also, if a message is sent to the computername of a Terminal Server, all Client
sessions will receive the message. This is similar to the functionality of the
MSG * command.
