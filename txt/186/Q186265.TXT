SUMMARY
=======

You can use the SQL Server DATEPART() function to get the milliseconds of a SQL
Server datetime field returned to a Visual Basic application.

The advantage of using the SQL Server DATEPART() function is that it is simple to
use and works with all versions of ADO, DAO, and RDO. The disadvantage of using
the DATEPART() function is that it is specific to SQL Server. However, other
servers may have comparable functions.

Do not confuse the SQL Server DATEPART() function with the Visual Basic
DatePart() function, which is used with the Visual Basic Date datatype.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SQL Server DATEPART() function returns a portion of a SQL Server datetime
field.

The syntax of the SQL Server DATEPART() function is:

      DATEPART(portion, datetime)

where datetime is name of a SQL Server datetime field and portion is one of the
following:

   Ms    for Milliseconds
   Yy    for Year
   Qq    for Quarter of the Year
   Mm    for Month
   Dy    for the Day of the Year
   Dd    for Day of the Month
   Wk    for Week
   Dw    for the Day of the Week
   Hh    for Hour
   Mi    for Minute
   Ss    for Second

Use the SQL Server DATEPART() function in a Transact-SQL (T-SQL) SELECT
statement. An example T-SQL statement using DATEPART() follows:

      SELECT Pubdate, DATEPART(Ms, Pubdate) FROM Titles

This would return Pubdate and the millisecond portion of Pubdate.

Sample Code
-----------

The following example uses the ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) 1.5 library. The same
T-SQL statement would work with the DAO and RDO libraries also.

1. Create a System Datasource named Pubs. The Datasource should use the SQL
   Server driver and the Pubs database that is included with SQL Server.

2. Create a new Visual Basic Standard EXE Project. Form1 is created by default.

3. Add a reference to the Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects library.

4. Place a CommandButton on Form1, and copy the following code into the
   Command1_Click() event procedure:

         Dim rs As New ADODB.Recordset
         Dim strSql As String
         Dim strCnn As String

         strCnn = "DSN=Pubs;UID=;PWD=;DATABASE=Pubs"
         strSql = "SELECT pubdate, datepart(Ms,pubdate) FROM titles"

         rs.Open strSql, strCnn, adOpenKeyset, adLockOptimistic
         rs.MoveFirst

         Debug.Print "PubDate", "Milliseconds"
         Do Until rs.EOF
             Debug.Print rs(0), rs(1)
             rs.MoveNext
         Loop
         rs.Close

   NOTE: You may need to modify the UID and PWD to represent your SQL Server
   installation ie UID=sa.

5. Run the project.

6. Click Command1 to execute the above code.

7. Choose View, Immediate Window from the Visual Basic Standard Toolbar to see
   the program's output.
