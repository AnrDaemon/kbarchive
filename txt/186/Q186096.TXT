TITLE   :XADM: Eseutil.exe Does Not Fix Records with Missing Long Values
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Eseutil.exe utility with the /P switch to repair a Microsoft
Exchange Server database, Eseutil.exe may encounter a record that references a
long value that does not exist. Eseutil.exe treats this as a non-corrupting
error and does not fix the problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you apply the fix, when Eseutil.exe encounters a record that references a
long value that does not exist, Eseutil.exe fixes the problem by removing the
record from the database.
