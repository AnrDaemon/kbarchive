TITLE   :XWEB: "Failed to Send Message" Using OWA Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Pack 1 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to send a message using the Outlook Web Access client the
following may occur. After you compose a new message to a recipient who does not
exist in the global address book, and then use Check Name to attempt to resolve
the name, the name cannot be resolved. If you remove the invalid name from the
TO: line and attempt to send the message, the following error occurs:

   Failed to Send message

After you click OK, the following error message is displayed:

   You must enter at least one name in the To, Cc, or Bcc box

This error is expected. However, the "failed to send message" is not, because the
message should not be attempted to be sent.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
