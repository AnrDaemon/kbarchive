TITLE   :Back Level SNA Manager May Save Com.cfg Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Several new features have been added to SNA Server that have resulted in changes
to the SNA Server's configuration file (Com.cfg). One such addition is multi-SAP
support that allows the selection of the Local and Remote SAP from the
connection. Back-level clients are not aware of this change and may overwrite
the information stored in the Com.cfg file that represents this information.
Connection problems may not be evident until the server is restarted or the SNA
Server service is cycled.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use SNA Manager to administer an SNA Server subdomain, care should be
taken to ensure all SNA Servers and SNA WinNT clients that make and save changes
to the configuration file (Com.cfg), are running a service pack at least equal
to the service pack level installed on the Primary SNA Server of that subdomain.
