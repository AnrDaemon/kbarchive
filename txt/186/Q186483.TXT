The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

By default the Network DDE service on a Terminal Server is set to start
manually. If you attempt to start the service, you receive a 2185 error: The
Service Name is Invalid. The service cannot be started from a command prompt
either.

This is expected behavior on a Terminal Server. The Network DDE service is
disabled. Because Network DDE relies on the registration of unique computer
names to share information across a DDE share, the service will not work in a
multi-user environment. This does not mean, however, that users cannot make use
of DDE applications.

Terminal Server uses a multi-user version of NetDDE. Instead of registering
unique computernames, the Terminal Server NetDDE registers unique usernames.
This makes more sense in a multi-user environment, although it adds to new
requirement (not typically seen in Windows NT environments) that users log on
with unique user names.

To start the multi-user NetDDE, all a user has to do is start a DDE application
like Chat. This will load the necessary files, start the NetDDE agent, and
register the user's name on the network for DDE services. Note that only the
first instance of the user's name will allow NetDDE registration. If a user logs
on at multiple locations, only the first logon will allow NetDDE.
