SUMMARY
=======

These commands run the Windows NT C2 Configuration Manager, which is used to
help configure the security of a Windows NT Workstation, Windows NT Server, or a
Windows Terminal Server. The C2 Configuration Manager may be used to change one
or more security attributes on the system. Refer to the Windows NT
Administration documentation for more information on what the correct settings
are for the desired security level as well as for more information on defining
and implementing a security policy. C2 Security

The National Computer Security Center (NCSC) is the United States government
agency responsible for performing software product security evaluations. These
evaluations are carried out against a set of requirements outlined in the NCSC
publication Department of Defense Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria,
which is commonly referred to as the Orange Book. Windows NT has been
successfully evaluated by the NCSC at the C2 level as defined in the Orange
Book. Because Windows NT supports C2 Level security, the workstation must be
configured appropriately to apply this. Additionally, Windows NT supports
security features that are not required to meet C2 Level security. The Windows
NT C2 Security System Administrators Guide provides information on how to define
and implement security on your system and should be reviewed for more
information.
