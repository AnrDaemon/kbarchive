SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain circumstances, a variable defined within a report is not released
after closing the report or after printing.

 - Place the code to modify, to print, or to preview the report in a program or
   procedure. Because the scope of variable is private, the variable disappears
   when the procedure or program finishes running.

1. Open the Employee.dbf table.

2. Create a Quick Report based on the Employee table.

3. Add a memory variable named Leftover to the report.

4. Save the report with the name Ztest.frx and close the report.

5. A reference to the variable appears on the desktop after you type the
   following code in the Command window and press ENTER:
