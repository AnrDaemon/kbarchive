TITLE   :SMS: Msapps32.pdf Does Not Support Windows NT Clients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbPGC smsappman smsinst smspgc kbSMSAppMan

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you send a shared package using the default settings for Msapps32.pdf, the
package is only distributed to clients running Windows 95. Windows NT clients do
not receive the package.

CAUSE
=====

The Msapps32.pdf file that is included with Microsoft Systems Management Server
version 1.2 does not automatically support distribution to client computers
running Windows NT that have Intel-based processors. This can cause Program
Group Control to fail on these types of client computers.

WORKAROUND
==========

For Windows NT clients to receive the package, manually add the following to the
SupportedPlatforms line of the Msapps32.pdf file:

   Windows NT 3.1 (x86)

NOTE: Although Systems Management Server searches for the string "Windows NT 3.1
(x86)", it will still find client computers running Windows NT 4.0.

After making this change, the line should be similar to the following:

      SupportedPlatforms=Windows95, Windows NT 3.1 (x86)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):
