SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to turn off the list of most recently used fonts using the
RegOptions macro found in the Support8.dot template, or if you manually change
the value of the NoFontMRUList setting to equal 1 in the Microsoft Windows 95
registry, the most recently used (MRU) list of fonts still appears.

To view the list of most recently used fonts, on the Format toolbar click the
Font list and scroll to the top of the list of fonts.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

This problem has been corrected in Word 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The RegOptions macro can be used to modify Word settings that are stored in the
Windows registry.

To run the RegOptions macro supplied in the Support8.dot template, follow these
steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Templates and Add-ins, and then click Add.

2. Change to the Office\Macros folder (for example, C:\Program files\Microsoft
   Office\Office\Macros). Click to select the Support8.dot file and click OK
   twice.

   This adds the Support8 template to the "Global Templates and Add-ins" box.

3. On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Macros. In the Macros In
   list, select "Support8.dot (Global template)." In the Macros Name list, click
   RegOptions, and then click Run.
