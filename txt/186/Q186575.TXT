SUMMARY
=======

The NetWare User Access for Terminal Server administrator tool (or Nw2nt.exe at
a command prompt) can be used to migrate NetWare users from a bindery-context
NetWare server (not an NDS mode server) to Terminal Server. Both users and
groups can be migrated.

NOTE: All migrated user passwords will be blank.

NOTE: Be careful what groups exist on the NetWare server before migrating. For
instance, if there is a group called Adminstrators on the NetWare server, users
will be added to the existing Terminal Server's Administrator's group.
