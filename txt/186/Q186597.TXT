The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

You may receive an error when installing or running an application stating that
an OCX file or a DLL file needs to be registered as system global. Make a note
of the file that needs to be registered.

MORE INFORMATION
================

OCX Files
---------

1. Start your server in VGA mode.

2. You will need to use the Regsvr.exe, Regsvr16.exe (16-bit), or Regsvr32.exe
   (32-bit) command to register the OCX file as system global. These commands
   are included in the development kit when Visual Basic or Visual FoxPro is
   installed.

Depending on the application, you may have to register several OCX files this
way.

DLL Files
---------

To register a DLL as a system global, go to the SYSTEM32 directory and locate the
DLL mentioned in the error message. The command to register a file called
Sample.dll is:

   REGISTER /S SAMPLE.DLL

Registration data for a program is recognized only when the program is loaded.
Therefore, if you issue a REGISTER command for a program that is already loaded,
the changes will not take effect until the next time the program is loaded.

Also note that only administrators can run REGISTER.
