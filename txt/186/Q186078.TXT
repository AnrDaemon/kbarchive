TITLE   :Name Resolution May Fail If NetBios Name Has ASCII Character
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Name resolution may fail if the NetBIOS name has an ASCII sixteenth character.
The problem occurs with Microsoft Systems Management Server Remote Control
service when trying to attach to a computer running the Remote Control server
component. The problem occurs when the name is not registered with WINS, and DNS
is used to resolve the name.

This problem may occur with any application using ASCII characters for NetBIOS
name suffix.

CAUSE
=====

Systems Management Server Remote Control service uses <0x43> (ASCII "C")
as NetBIOS name suffix for Systems Management Server Administrators Remote
Control tool.

While generating the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) to be resolved by DNS,
the NetBIOS service parses the name incorrectly when the suffix is an ASCII
character.

Knowledge Base:
