SUMMARY
=======

The Terminal Server client session is essentially a Windows NT Workstation
session. If the Terminal Server client user wants to print to a shared printer
on, for example, a computer running Windows 95 on the network, an appropriate
printer driver will need to be installed on the Terminal Server computer. If
not, when the Terminal Server client user tries to print to the shared printer,
the client user will be prompted to install the printer driver. However,
Terminal Server client users are typically not Terminal Server administrators.
As with Windows NT Workstation, only administrators can install drivers. So, the
Terminal Server client user will normally be unable to install the driver needed
to print to the shared printer. A Terminal Server administrator will need to
install the printer driver.
