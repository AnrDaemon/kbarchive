The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 3.0, 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to establish communication with a Web site that requires client
authentication, you may receive the following error messages:

   HTTP Error 403
   403.7 Forbidden: Client certificate required

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when the resource that you are trying to access requires that
your browser has a client Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate that the server
recognizes. This is used for authenticating you as a valid user of the resource.
Contact the administrator of the Web server to obtain a valid client
certificate.

There are several possible causes of this problem:

 - The root certificate (certificate authority certificate) of the client
   certificate issuing server is not installed on the computer that is running
   IIS.

   -or-

 - The client certificate has expired or the effective time has not been
   reached.

   -or-

 - The client certificate has been revoked.

RESOLUTION
==========

Depending on the cause of your problem, try one of the following resolutions:

 - Download the root server certificate in a browser on the server computer. Run
   the Iisca.exe command line utility that is located in the Inetsrv directory.

 - Check the effective date on the client certificate and make sure that the
   date and time has arrived. Check the expiration date and make sure that the
   certificate has not expired.

 - Contact your certificate authority to see if your certificate has expired.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 and IIS 4.0 store their root certificates in
different locations of the registry. The Iisca.exe utility synchronizes the two
root certificate stores.
