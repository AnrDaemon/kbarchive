TITLE   :WD97: Advanced Power Management Causes Data Loss
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbdta word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use advanced power management software on a computer with a document
open in Microsoft Word, you may lose data when the computer goes into suspend
mode.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if your document is opened from the network when the
advanced power management software is on. When the computer is not in use for a
specified time, the advanced power management software will activate suspend
mode which will cause possible data loss.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Office 97
Service Release 2 (SR-2).

For additional information about SR-2, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q151261 OFF97: How to Obtain and Install MS Office 97 SR-2

MORE INFORMATION
================

Office 97 SR-2 will prevent your advanced power management (APM) software from
suspending the system with a document opened in Word. If your APM software tries
to activate the suspend mode, you will receive the following message:

   Word cannot suspend while you have documents open from a network location. To
   allow your machine to suspend, close open documents or quit Word.

NOTE: If the file is opened locally, rather than from the network, the suspend
mode will activate without the message and no data loss will occur.
