SUMMARY
=======

The Terminal Server Administration tool can be used to view and administer
Terminal Servers in the same domain. Terminal Servers in trusted domains are
also visible.

For example, when an administrator uses Terminal Server Administrator on a
Terminal Server computer that is a member of domain A, other Terminal Servers in
domain A will be visible. If domain A trusts domain B, domain B's Terminal
Server computers will also be visible. However, Terminal Servers in domains that
trust domain A will not be visible.
