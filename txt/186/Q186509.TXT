CPROFILE -- Additional Notes
----------------------------

File associations allow users to associate a specific application with a specific
file type. File association allows the Terminal Server to know what application
to use to access files of a particular type. File types are registered using
Explorer. Per-user file associations allow each user to have a different
application associated with a specific file type. For example, one user could
have .doc files associated with Microsoft Word and another user could have .doc
files associated with Word Viewer.

User-specific file associations are disabled by executing peruser /disable. If
the user-specific file associations are not disabled, cprofile removes only the
wasted space from the user's profile. When items are removed from a user's
profile, the corresponding registry does not reduce in size. Cprofile is useful
in clearing wasted space from the registry.

Note: This command will not modify profiles that are currently in use.
