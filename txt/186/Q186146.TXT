TITLE   :Double-Clicking .reg File Will Not Add Extended ANSI Values
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Extended ANSI values in a .reg files are not added to the registry.

If you create a .reg file that contains any @=hex(2) values or you modify and
existing .reg fil,e none of the extended ANSI values after the @=hex(2) value
will be added to the registry.

Example of a .reg file:

      REGEDIT4

      [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\aifffile\DefaultIcon]
      @=hex(2):44,3a,5c,57,49,4e,4e,54,34,30,5c,53,79,73,74,65,6d,33,32,5c,
      71,75,61,72,74,7a,2e,64,6c,6c,2c,2d,32,30,32,00
      "AMovie.bak"="MPlayer.exe,2"

Changing any of the ANSI codes after the @=kex(2) value and then double- clicking
the .reg file will not yield any changes to the registry for that key; neither
will running REGEDIT Test.reg.

NOTE: You can create a .reg file by running REGEDIT, selecting the key you want
to export, and then selecting Export Registry from the Registry menu.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is a limitation with Regedit.exe

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, export the key(s) you want to modify with the
Windows NT Server 4.0 Resource Kit utilities Regdmp.exe and Regini.exe.

For information about how to use REGDMP and REGINI, please refer to the Windows
NT Server 4.0 Resource Kit documentation.

STATUS
