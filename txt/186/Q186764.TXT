TITLE   :XCLN: Cannot Search For Names That Contain Swedish Characters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you type a character from a Swedish character set in the "Type Name or Select
from List:" box in the Address Book or Select Names dialog box, you may not
automatically scroll down to the mailboxes and distribution lists whose display
names start with that character. This problem occurs when you are using a U.S.
Microsoft Exchange client to connect to a Microsoft Mail postoffice that meets
the following criteria:

 - The postoffice is located on a Microsoft Windows NT Server computer that is
   configured to use a Swedish code page.

 - The address list on the postoffice has been sorted using Scandinavian sort
   order.

Note that this problem occurs when you select the global address list or
postoffice address list, but it does not occur when you select the personal
address book (PAB). In addition, note that this problem does not occur if you
use a Microsoft Mail client to connect to the Microsoft Mail postoffice.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Exchange Server address list provider for
Microsoft Mail (Msfs32.dll) and the Microsoft Mail Resort.exe utility that is
used to sort the address list on the postoffice do not use the same sort order.
The Exchange Server address list provider uses a static sort table, while the
Resort.exe utility uses a sort order based on the C850sort.glb file located on
the postoffice.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service
