TITLE   :WD97: Hyperlink to Bookmark Fails in Word Document Using Browser
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word97 kbwdinternet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you click a hyperlink that is referenced to a bookmark in a Word document,

 - The document opens but does not go to the specified bookmark location.

   -or-

 - You receive an error message stating that the browser cannot find the
   Internet site <path>\<Filename.doc#<bookmark>

CAUSE
=====

The hyperlink is referenced to a bookmark in a Microsoft Word document (*.doc).
Web browsers do not currently support the use of anchors in files that are not
in HTML format.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, you must save the document containing the bookmarks as
HTML format.

To save a Word document as HTML, follow these steps:

1. Open the document.

2. On the File menu, click Save As.

3. From the Save As Type list, select HTML Document (*.htm;*.html;*.htx).

4. Click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Word 97 allows you to use hyperlinks to go to a bookmark location in
another document. This functionality is not disabled when editing a file that is
saved as HTML. So, while editing an HTML file, if you insert a hyperlink to a
bookmark location in a Word document (*.doc), that hyperlink will open the
referenced document and go to the specified location.
