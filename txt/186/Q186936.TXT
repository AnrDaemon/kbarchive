======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access Service Pack 1 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When you enter a Universal Resource Locator (URL) in a Contact or in an
Appointment in the Outlook Web Access (OWA) client, the URL does not become a
hyperlink that you can click to jump to the address. Hyperlinks are not
available when you create a Contact or Appointment in the OWA client.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you need to open a URL entered into a Contact or Appointment from the Outlook
Web Access client, copy the URL and paste it into the address field of a browser
window to activate the link.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the Outlook client you can enter a URL inside a Contact or Appointment to
create a hyperlink; however, OWA does not currently support this feature. All
normal messages you send in the OWA client will allow you to enter a URL as a
hyperlink.
