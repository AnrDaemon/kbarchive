   ID : 8009

   Type : Information
   Category : None
   Decription : End Verify to 'C.'

MORE INFORMATION
================

When NTbackup verifies files after a backup, it logs an event to the Application
Event Log on completion. If there are no differences noted in the files on the
tape versus the files on the drive, then the Event Type will be informational.
If there are differences noted in the files on the tape versus the files on the
drive, then the Event Type will be error. If the Event Type is error, more
information can be obtained in the Backup.log file. Enable Full Detail logging
to generate detailed information about the differences that were detected.

An error does not necessarily mean that the file is corrupt. It can indicate that
changes were made to the file or that files have been deleted or added since the
backup was completed. Depending on the environment that is being backed up,
multiple error messages of type 8009 can be common. However, it is good practice
to monitor your backups and ensure that they complete successfully.
