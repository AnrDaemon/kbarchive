TITLE   :Using Microsoft Exchange Forms with Terminal Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Exchange Clients running inside Terminal Server Client sessions may
not be able to access Exchange forms.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is that Exchange looks for the forms (Frmcache.dat) in the Terminal
Server SystemRoot\Forms directory. By default, when an application asks for the
system directory, the system responds with the Terminal Server user's Windows
directory located in the user's home directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem is resolved by running the Microsoft Office 97 compatibility
script. Alternatively, if Microsoft Outlook 98 is installed without Office 97,
the Outlook 98 compatibility script should be used. The Outlook 98 compatibility
script can be downloaded from the following Microsoft Web site:
