TITLE   :XFOR: OV/VM Connector Fails to Return NDR for Message Addressed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:3.2, 5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - LinkAge Message Exchange, version 3.2 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The LinkAge Connector version 3.2 and Microsoft Exchange Connector for IBM OV/VM
version 5.5 fail to return non-delivery reports (NDRs) for messages that are
addressed to non-existent Exchange PROFS proxy addresses.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PROFS

      PROFS
   NODE2 (USER2)
         |
         |<- OV/VM Connector
         |
 Exchange Site 1
   NODE1 (USER1)

Address Space on OV/VM Connector in Site 1:

   PROFS * cost=1

If a user in Site 1 addresses a message to an unknown mailbox, using Site 1's
PROFS proxy node name of NODE1, the sender never receives an NDR. For example,
if the Exchange user USER1 addresses a message to the unknown PROFS proxy
address NODE1(UNKNOWN), USER1 never receives an NDR. However, if the same user
addresses a message to an unknown PROFS address whose node name is not used as
an Exchange Site Addressing PROFS proxy address, the sender receives an NDR as
expected.

STATUS
======
