PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,4.0a,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe kbSSafe400 kbSSafe500 _IK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Visual SourceSafe status.dat file size is larger than expected.

RESOLUTION
==========

The fastest method is to rename the status.dat file, then run the following
command at the command prompt:

      DDCONV -S <Path to data dir>

DDCONV.exe is located in the VSS\Win32 subdirectory.

A less efficient method is to rename the Status.dat file, then run the Analyze
utility with the -f switch.
