PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you insert an image in a paragraph that use the Formatted style, and you
change the image alignment to left or right justification, the image
disappears.

This behavior does not occur in FrontPage 98.

CAUSE
=====

The HTML parser in FrontPage removes the <IMG> tag if the align= attribute
occurs inside the <IMG> tag and the <IMG> tag is nested inside the
<PRE> element.

RESOLUTION
==========

Format the image and text using a table. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click at the beginning of the Formatted style paragraph.

2. On the Table menu, click Insert Table.

3. In the Rows box, enter "1" (without the quotation marks). In the Columns box,
   enter "2"(without the quotation marks).

4. Click OK.

5. Select the formatted paragraph.

6. On the Edit menu, click Cut.

7. Click in the cell where you want the text to appear and then click Paste on
   the Edit menu.

   NOTE: If you want the image to appear to the left of the text, place the text
   in the right-hand cell. If you want the image to appear to the right of the
   text, place the text in the left-hand cell.

8. Click in the other cell and then click Image on the Insert menu.

   NOTE: You may need to adjust the image, cell, and table properties to achieve
   the correct formatting for the page.
