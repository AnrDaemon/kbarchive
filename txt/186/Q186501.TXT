IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key" Help
topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

To have a Terminal Server computer start up and automatically log on with an
administrator account, modify the registry using Registry Editor (Regedt32.ese).
This will not affect Terminal Server Client logon attempts.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), and go to the following subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT
      \CurrentVersion\Winlogon

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

2. Add the following values to Winlogon:

      AutoAdminLogon: REG_SZ: 1
      DefaultUserName: REG_SZ: <username>
      DefaultPassword: REG_SZ: <Password for username>
      DefaultDomainName: REG:SZ: <Domain for username>
      DontDisplayLastUserName: REG_SZ: 0
