PERUSER -- Additional Notes
---------------------------

By default, all file associations in applications such as File Manager are system
global (they apply to all users). Per-user file associations are not enabled
because they may cause user profiles to grow 1-2 MB. If you have users who
require per-user file associations (for example, if one user wants to associate
.doc files with Microsoft Word but another user wants them to start the Word
Viewer), you can enable per-user file associations by using the peruser /enable
command. Use peruser /disable to disable per- user file associations. Use
peruser /query to check if per-user file associations are enabled.
