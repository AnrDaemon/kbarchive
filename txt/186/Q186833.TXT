TITLE   :XADM: Internet Messages with Attachments Have Wrong Extension
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

This issue involves a Windows 3.x messaging client opening a message containing
attachments, which was received from the Internet. If the file names of the
attachments originally contained no file extension, the Windows 3.x messaging
client will display random file name extensions for the attachment file names.

For example, if an attachment was sent with a file name of TESTFILE, the Windows
3.x messaging client will see the attachment as TESTFILE.EST.

CAUSE
=====

The PR_ATTACH_FILENAME MAPI property of the Internet message attachment was
being computed improperly for attachments without extensions. Windows NT and
Windows 95 messaging clients use the PR_ATTACH_LONG_FILENAME MAPI property,
which was being computed properly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
