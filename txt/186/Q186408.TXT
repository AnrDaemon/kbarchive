TITLE   :SMS: Secondary Site Upgrade Fails When Too Many Logon Servers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under specific circumstances, when you attempt to upgrade a secondary site, the
upgrade may fail because of timing-related issues. This may occur in
environments where there are several secondary site servers under the central
site, and each secondary site has numerous logon servers.

CAUSE
=====

During a secondary site upgrade process, the Upgrade Bootstrap Service is
delivered to the secondary site server and started. This issues a site shutdown
using a SHUTDOWN.CT1.

Note that the shutdown may take an inordinate amount of time because of the
number of logon servers.

During this time, the parent site's Hierarchy Manager Service sends the site
install package. The Systems Management Server Despooler Service is still active
at the secondary site server because it has not shut down, and it records the
following error message:

   Executing instruction of type MICROSOFT|SMS|MINIJOBINSTRUCTION|CONFIG
   Cannot find config mini inst specific data
   Despooler failed to execute the instruction, error code = c0000001

The secondary site never upgrades, it simply goes into an Emergency Restart after
48 hours.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, force an upgrade of the secondary site from its
parent site using the PREINST Command:

      PREINST /UPGRADE:SecondarySiteCode

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
