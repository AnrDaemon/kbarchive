TITLE   :Terminal Server Client Error: Not a Valid Windows NT Application
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A non-administrator user tries to launch an applications and receives the
following error:

   <application> is not a valid Windows NT application.

The error may also occur if the system tried to start an application (such as
Systray.exe on startup). Also, the system may not be able to determine what
application is failing. In this case, the error message will appear but the
<application> area may be blank.

CAUSE
=====

The most likely cause is that the administrator has turned on the administrator
utility Application Security, but has not added the failing application to the
list of allowed applications.

RESOLUTION
==========

At the Terminal Server, the administrator can add the failing application to the
list of authorized applications. To do this,

1. Run the Application Security application and click ADD.

2. Browse for the application or enter the path. If the error message does not
   list the application, the administrator may need to run file auditing to
   determine what is failing.
