======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q194329.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view a page containing a hyperlink that references a bookmark on the
current page in a Web browser, the hyperlink appears in the color that you
specified for the visited hyperlink even though you are viewing the page for the
first time.

CAUSE
=====

The browser logs its history on a per-page basis only. Individual bookmarks on
the current page are not logged. Because the hyperlink points to a bookmark on
the current page and the page is logged as having been visited, the hyperlink
appears in the color that you specified for the visited hyperlink.


Additional query words: hyperlink bookmark
