TITLE   :PointCast Business Network: Error with Pcn32.exe
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the PointCast Business Network application on a Terminal Server
computer, the following error message may be displayed:

   Pcn32.exe - Ordinal not found.

CAUSE
=====

If you experience this problem, it is because the wrong version of Mfc42.dll is
installed. The file date on Terminal Server's version of Mfc42.dll is more
recent than the version included with PointCast Business Network. The
application is set up to not install its own version of the .dll file, because
the Terminal Server's version is newer, although in fact it is the wrong (and
older) version.

RESOLUTION
==========

TO work around this problem, copy Mfc42.dll (currently 01/31/97 02:24p 941,840)
from PointCast Business Network to the Terminal Server computer.
