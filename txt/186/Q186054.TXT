======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SLI_SEND and SLI_RECEIVE verbs can only send or receive a maximum of 65
kilobytes (KB) of data each time they are issued by a SLI application.

The lua_data_length parameter is used to specify the amount of data to be sent in
a SLI_SEND verb. The SLI_RECEIVE verb uses the lua_max_length parameter to
specify the length of the buffer that is to be used to receive data.

CAUSE
=====

The 65-KB data length per SLI_SEND/SLI_RECEIVE is by design. The lua_data_length
and lua_max_length parameters are defined as Unsigned Integers (unsigned int),
which limits their maximum values to 2^16 bytes (approximately 65 KB).

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.1, 2.11,
2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, and 4.0 SP1.

SNA Server 3.0
--------------

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. To resolve this problem immediately, contact
Microsoft Technical Support to obtain the fix. If you are not severely impacted
by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next SNA
Server 3.0 service pack that contains this fix.

For SNA Server 3.0:

      File Name        Date       Time

      snatrc.dll      6/16/98  8:29AM
      snatrccn.dll    6/16/98  8:29AM
      snatrcsn.dll    6/16/98  8:29AM

SNA Server 4.0
--------------

This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SLI API has been extended to include the following new verbs:

 - SLI_SEND_EX

 - SLI_RECEIVE_EX

These new verbs can be used instead of SLI_SEND and SLI_RECEIVE in those SLI
applications that require sending or receiving more than 65 KB of data with each
send or receive issued. These new SLI verbs include the following new
parameters:

   SLI_SEND_EX:     lua_data_length_ex
   SLI_RECEIVE_EX:  lua_max_length_ex

Each of these new parameters is defined as Unsigned Long Integers (unsigned
long), which allows their maximum values to be 2^32 bytes (approximately 4 GB).

These SLI API updates are available after applying the fix or service pack
mentioned previously.

Please refer to the SNA Server LUA Programmer's Guide for more details on both
the RUI and SLI APIs included with SNA Server.
