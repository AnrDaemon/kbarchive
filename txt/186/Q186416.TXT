TITLE   :System Hang Results from Large Number of Notify Syncs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP3 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your computer running Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) that is configured as
a domain controller may stop responding (hang) when approximately 400 users with
a centralized desktop scheme are connected to the domain controller.

CAUSE
=====

With this centralized desktop scheme, the most significant network load came
about when the Start Menu and Desktop were refreshed. The Explorer shell from
the client causes a series of NotifyChangeDirectoryFile calls to be made to the
file system of the server during these refresh cycles. Each call causes a notify
sync object to be allocated and places an IRP in the notify queue.

In this configuration, the 400 users generated a significant number of notify
syncs, which eventually would create a mismatch between an associated IRP and
its notify synch object because of a timing issue.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
