The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Terminal Server renders client screens at 256 colors regardless of the
Terminal Server's actual screen resolution. For the best performance,
computers running as 16-bit and 32-bit Terminal Server clients should be
set to run at 256 colors. Otherwise, the client screens must be rendered at
the server in 256 colors and each pixel must then be modified to 16 colors.
