SYMPTOMS

When you attach files vertically in a message body, send the message to
yourself, and then forward the message again to yourself, the location of the
attachments is shifted in the forwarded message. This happens only in the
double-byte character set (DBCS) client.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is caused by a MAPI failure to add the current message body position
to the new offset.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
