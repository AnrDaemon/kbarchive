SUMMARY
=======

If you need to install additional hardware on an existing Terminal Server,
Microsoft recommends that you use Installation mode, not Execution mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The standard Terminal Server mode is Execution mode. The server starts in
Execution mode when you start the system. The system is not operating in a
global fashion when it is in Execution Mode. That is, the system expects many
concurrent user sessions. This requires that the system keep sessions completely
separate from each other, including the user at the system console. For
instance, every user has a Windows and Windows\System directory that no one else
uses. If an application requests the location of the system root, the system
will point the application to the user's Windows directory rather than the
actual Terminal Server system root. This is appropriate for application use, but
not for installation. Differences like this can cause a hardware device
installation to complete successfully but fail for users other than the
administrator, who installed the device. In the worst case, the device will fail
for everyone.

In Installation Mode the system acts like a Windows NT Server, in most ways. The
system expects that you are installing a device or an application for global
access.


To install a device using Installation mode, open a command prompt and enter the
command, CHANGE USER /INSTALL. Then install your device. Return to the command
prompt after installation, and enter CHANGE USER /EXECUTE. If the device
installation requires you to reboot the server, doing so will place the server
back in Execution mode.
