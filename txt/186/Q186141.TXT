PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbdta word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a Word 97 document containing bullets and/or numbers that you
saved in the WordPerfect 5.x for Windows format, the bullets and numbers are not
retained.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if Microsoft FrontPage 98 is installed on the same computer
as Microsoft Word 97.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Microsoft Word 97 for Windows Service
Release 1 (SR-1).

You can work around this problem without upgrading to Microsoft Word Service
Release 1 (SR-1). To do this, perform a custom installation of FrontPage 98 and
do not do not install the Proofing Tools and Converters (in the Components
section).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Word 97
Service Release 1 (SR-1).
