======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Microsoft Exchange Server Internet Mail Service , the
following events may appear in the application event log:

   Event ID: 4018
   Type: Error
   Source: MSExchangeIMC

   Description:
   Unable to start the Internet Mail Connector service because
   MAPI could not be initialized.

   Event ID: 4116
   Type: Error
   Source: MSExchangeIMC

   Description:
   An error was returned from the messaging software, the Internet
   Mail Service uses, to process messages on the Microsoft Exchange
   Server. It is possible that the piece of mail being processed
   at the time will not be delivered. The message that was being
   processed has been moved to the "BAD" folder. Use the appropriate
   utilities found in the SUPPORT directory of your Exchange CD to view and
   manipulate these messages.

CAUSE
=====

A possible cause of these errors is that the Exchange service account lacks the
proper access rights to the Winnt\System32 (%System Root%\System32) directory.

The service account must have change rights to this directory to be able to
modify the Mapisvc.inf file located in the %SystemRoot%\System32 directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, give the service account at least change rights to
the %SystemRoot%\System32 directory.
