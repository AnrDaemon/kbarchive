TITLE   :XCLN: Macintosh Client Adds Characters to Paste in 4D Database
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using a 4D Macintosh database for tracking data, and you receive
strings of alphanumeric characters in a message body in Exchange and then copy
this information from the message and paste it into the 4D Macintosh database,
you may have trouble querying on the information pasted into the database.

This procedure works fine with the Exchange Macintosh client version 4.0 Service
Pack 2, but fails with all clients thereafter, including the Microsoft Outlook
Macintosh client.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange client erroneously adds characters to the end of the string.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Macintosh client,
version 5.0.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
