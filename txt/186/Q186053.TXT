 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you remove a Distributed Link Service from a computer running SNA Server
2.11 SP1 or SP2, or you remove a Distributed Link Service from a computer
running SNA Server 3.0 (SP1, SP2, or SP3) that had been upgraded from 2.11 SP1
or SP2, the following registry key will have all its subkeys removed except for
Network Control Panel:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog
   \Application

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server 2.11 Distributed Link Service .inf file, Snaremls.inf,
inadvertantly removes the entire Application Event Log Registry Key when a
Distributed Link Service is uninstalled.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.11 SP1,
2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, and 3.0 SP3.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression- tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.


MORE INFORMATION

(all SPs) is installed on a server that has not been upgraded from SNA Server
