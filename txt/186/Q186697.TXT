SUMMARY
=======

Inbox Assistant rules (Rules Wizard in Outlook 8.5) use an ANDing process,
meaning all the conditions on the rule must be met for the rule to function.
However, if you click Advanced on the Edit Rule dialog box, and select the "Only
Items that do not Match These Conditions" option, then an ORing process on
conditions will be used, and the rule will function if any of the conditions are
not true instead of if all of the conditions are not true.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is by product design.

When adding conditions for an Inbox Assistant rule, all are considered AND
conditions for the rule to be met. By selecting the "Only Items that do not
Match These Conditions" option on the Advanced button, you will create a NOT
condition for the rule. A NOT condition of a collection of ANDs is an OR
condition.
