TITLE   :SMS: NOAUTOUPGRADE Switch to Prevent Upgrade of Secondary Sites
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbConfig kbsmsAdmin kbsmsUtil smsadmin smssetup smsconfig smsinst smsutil

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A modified Setup.exe file, which includes the /SYSMAP and /NOAUTOUPGRADE
options, is available from both the BackOffice Resource Kit and the Microsoft
Web site, but is not required for applying Service Pack 3 (SP3) to a Systems
Management Server 1.2 primary site. However, the modified Setup.exe is required
for upgrading to Service Pack 1 (SP1) or Service Pack 2 (SP2) if you want to
prevent automatic upgrades of your secondary sites.

The SP3 version of Setup.cmd is updated and allows the use of the /NOAUTOUPGRADE
switch without requiring a modified version of the program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To apply SP3 and prevent the secondary sites from being upgraded automatically,
use the Setup.cmd file from the Service Pack 3 CD. Use the following command:

      setup.cmd /noautoupgrade

This simplification is because the NOAUTOUPGRADE option is now supported in the
Setup.cmd file that is included in SP3.

Do not use the Setup.exe file from either the BackOffice Resource Kit or the
Microsoft Systems Management Server Web site for Service Pack 3 upgrades.
