======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The unattended installation process with Terminal Server is the same as the
process for Windows NT Server with three exceptions. The answer file has a new
option for the number of client licenses and whether to install Internet
Explorer 4.0, and Sysdiff needs to be run in Terminal Server's Installation
Mode.

numbers).

Applications and Sysdiff
------------------------

If you are preloading software and plan to use Sysdiff, the only difference
between usage in Windows NT and Terminal Server is that, with Terminal Server,
you should install applications and run Sysdiff in Installation Mode.

To enter Installation Mode, do one of the following:

 - Type the following command at an MS-DOS command prompt:

   "Change User /Install" (without the quotation marks)

 - Install applications through the Control Panels Add/Remove Programs tool.

Applications should be tested for full client functionality before using the
Terminal Server as a template for other servers. You can run applicable
application compatibility scripts, register .dll files, modify application
compatibility flags, and so on before using the server as a template.
