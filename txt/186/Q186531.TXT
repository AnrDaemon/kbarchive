KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run an application on a Terminal Server computer, you receive the
following error message:

   Cannot find *.ini. Please Re-run Setup.

CAUSE
=====

Typically, this means that the user does not have a home directory or that the
application was not installed using the Terminal Server's application
installation mode.

When an application is installed using the Terminal Server's installation mode,
the system captures creation of .INI files and registry settings and stores
them. When a user runs the application for the first time, the .INI file(s) will
be copied to the user's home directory, and registry settings will be written to
the user area of the registry.

RESOLUTION
==========

To install using installation mode, install the application using one of the
following methods:

 - Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel

   -or-

 - Type a "Change User /Install" command at an MS-DOS command prompt.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If this is not the problem, make sure the user has a home directory.

Home directories are specified in User Manager. Open an existing user's account
and click the Profile button. The path to the user's home directory can be
specified in this location, along with paths to profiles and logon scripts.
