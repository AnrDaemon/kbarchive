SYMPTOMS

You can use the Start command at a command prompt to start applications either
at the Terminal Server console or within a Terminal Server Client session. For
instance, the command

        start "\\server\share\group contact info.xls"

should open Excel and this spreadsheet, but it does not.

RESOLUTION
==========

To make the command work, the command line must be modified to:

        start \\server\share\"group contact info.xls"

STATUS
