SUMMARY
=======

If Client Services for NetWare is installed, NetWare User Access for Terminal
Server can be used to grant NetWare users access to the Terminal Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This tool is used to copy NetWare user accounts to Terminal Server. Both users
and groups are copied.

NOTE: NetWare 4.x servers must be in bindery emulation mode for this to work
because Terminal Server, like Windows NT Server, does not support the NDS API.

NOTE: Migrated users' passwords will be blank.
