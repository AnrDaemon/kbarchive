MORE INFORMATION
================

Task-switching hotkeys operate on the local computer level and are not passed
through to the Terminal Server. However, some alternative hotkeys have been
provided in the RDP Client:

   CTRL+ALT+END starts the Windows NT Security dialog box. Similar to Windows
   NT/2000 CTRL+ALT+DEL.

   ALT+PAGE UP switches between programs from left to right. Similar to Windows
   ALT+TAB.

   ALT+PAGE DOWN switches between programs from right to left. Similar to Windows
   SHIFT+ALT+TAB.

   ALT+INSERT cycles through the programs in most recently used order. Similar to
   Windows ALT+ESC.

   ALT+HOME displays the Start menu. Similar to Windows CTRL+ESC.

   CTRL+ALT+BREAK switches the Client between a window and a full screen.

   ALT+DELETE Displays the Windows menu.

   CTRL+ALT+MINUS (Minus as in the - symbol on the numeric keypad) Places a
   snapshot of the active window, within the client, on the Terminal server
   clipboard (provides the same functionality as pressing ALT+PrintScrn on a
   local computer.)

   CTRL+ALT+PLUS (Plus as in the + symbol on the numeric keypad) Places a
   snapshot of the entire client window area on the Terminal server clipboard
   (provides the same functionality as pressing PrintScrn on a local computer.)

Note the keyboard shortcuts listed above many not be supported on embedded
devices.
