TITLE   :SMS: MIF File Renamer - Mifname.exe
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Mifname.exe, which is available in the Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit, gives
Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.0 and 1.1 MIF files new file name
extensions based on their content. The Systems Management Server version 1.2
Dataloader is multithreaded for different types of MIF files. The different
types are determined by the extensions on the MIF files. However, Systems
Management Server versions 1.0 and 1.1 make no distinction among different types
of MIF files (all have a .mif extension). Therefore, MIF files being passed up a
hierarchy from a 1.0 or 1.1 site to a 1.2 site cannot take advantage of the 1.2
Dataloader's multithreaded attributes.

MIFNAME solves this by scanning the current directory (which should be
\Sms\Site.srv\Dataload.box\Deltamif.col) and changing MIF file name extensions
according to their content. MIFNAME performs this task at intervals that are
specified on the command line.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MIFNAME runs on Alpha, MIPS, and x86 hardware.

MIFNAME Syntax
--------------

   cd \sms\site.srv\dataload.box\deltamif.col
   mifname  [sleep_time]

sleep_time
----------

The amount of time to wait between checks of the Dataload.box directory. If this
parameter is omitted, only a single check is made. If the sleep_time value is
-1, MIFNAME displays a list of all MIF file types and their quantity, but does
not rename any. To bring MIFNAME out of sleep mode, press CTRL+C.
