TITLE   :FIX: LES Instruction Assembles Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::5.1,5.1a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 5.1, 5.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The program example below demonstrates a problem with the LES instructions in
Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) versions 5.1 and 5.1a. The first LES
instruction (Parm1) assembles correctly, but the second instruction (Parm2)
generates the error message:

   error A2056: Immediate mode illegal

The only difference between the two instructions is the order of the arguments.
In earlier versions of MASM, they produced identical code.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is with the type operator and the way it handles registers inside
brackets ([]). The type operator makes things a constant on the left of the
expression.

Parm1 works because it handles registers inside brackets differently. "TYPE x"
turns bp into a constant; +10 then turns it back into an addressing mode.

However, in Parm2, bp+10 has been turned into an addressing mode, which is then
turned into a constant by "TYPE x". This difference is demonstrated in the
sample code below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM versions 5.1 and 5.1a. This
problem was corrected in MASM version 6.0.
