SUMMARY
=======

When data need to be appended to a stream file that is terminated with the
CTRL+Z end-of-file (EOF) marker (ASCII 1Ah), use fopen() with an access mode of
"a+" to open the stream. This will ensure that all data appended to the stream
are accessible after the stream is closed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If fopen() is called with the "a+" mode, the operations of reading from and
writing to the opened stream file are valid. Before any data are appended, the C
Run-time reads the file and deletes the end-of-file marker. However, if fopen()
is called with the "a" mode, only the operation of writing to the opened file is
valid. The C Run-time must seek to the end of the file and append characters
after the end-of-file marker, CTRL+Z.

When displaying the contents of a text file, the MS-DOS and Windows NT TYPE
commands stop upon encountering a CTRL+Z character. Certain editors such as
Edlin and WordStar also ignore all characters after the first CTRL+Z in a file.
Consequently, if text is appended after the CTRL+Z end-of-file marker, it may
not be viewable.
