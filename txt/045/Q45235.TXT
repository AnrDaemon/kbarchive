-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, MS-DOS workstation, versions 1.37, 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you are in an application running in graphics mode, the Microsoft Mail (PC
Client) Notifier's Alert Window may not appear until after the application
running in graphics mode is quit.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Mail PC Client uses a text-based Character Oriented Window (COW) interface,
which may conflict with some applications using graphics mode for screen
display.

Although the Notifier will not work correctly, the Sound Chime will still sound
the arrival of new mail. You can turn off the Display Alert Window option from
the Preferences dialog box (on the Mail menu), and only use the Sound Chime
option.

Additional query words: 1.37 2.00 3.00 PC/AppleTalk
