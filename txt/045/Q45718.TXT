The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS, versions 5.03, 5.05, 5.1, 5.13, 5.3, 5.31.009, 5.5 
 - Microsoft LINK for OS/2, versions 5.03, 5.05, 5.1, 5.13 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to link an application fails and Microsoft LINK generates the
following message:

   L1064: Out of memory

CAUSE
=====

According to the "Microsoft FORTRAN, Microsoft CodeView and Utilities User's
Guide" for version 5.0 the causes of this error are as follows:

   The linker was not able to allocate enough memory from the operating system
   to link the program. On OS/2 try increasing the swap space. Otherwise, reduce
   the size of the program in terms of code, data, and symbols. On OS/2,
   consider splitting the program into dynalink libraries.

RESOLUTION
==========

The methods to work around this error depend on the operating system in which
LINK is running. In the MS-DOS operating system, the two methods to address this
situation are as follows:

 - Remove any unnecessary memory-resident software or device drivers that limit
   the amount of free memory.

 - Reduce the size of the application as described above.

If you are using LINK version 5.3 or later in the MS-DOS or Microsoft Windows
operating systems, the seven methods to address this situation are as follows:

1. Delete unnecessary files to free space on your hard disk.

2. Increase the size of the Windows swap file. To create the largest possible
   swap file, use a disk defragmentation utility to make the free space
   contiguous.

3. Reduce the size of the code, data, or symbols.

4. If the program is a segmented-executable file, place some of its code into a
   dynamic-link library (DLL).

5. Remove unnecessary terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) software.

6. Reconfigure the Expanded Memory Manager to provide more conventional memory.

7. Edit the CONFIG.SYS file to specify fewer buffers in the BUFFERS statement or
   fewer drives in the LASTDRIVE statement.

In the OS/2 operating system, the easiest method to work around this error is
perform the following three steps to increase the swap space:

1. Free up RAM and swap space by closing other screen groups and removing other
   processes from memory.

2. Load the CONFIG.SYS file into an editor. Find the SWAPPATH statement and
   determine the hard disk on which OS/2 stores the swap file. Delete one or
   more files from this hard disk or modify the SWAPPATH statement to point to a
   drive with more free space.

3. If the error persists, carefully read the explanation of the SWAPPATH setting
   in the text below and possibly decrease the swap value specified in the
   SWAPPATH setting.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The L1064: "Out of memory" error was introduces in LINK version 5.03 which was
first provided with the IMSL libraries for Microsoft FORTRAN version 4.1 and was
also provided with FORTRAN version 5.0.

Explanation of the SWAPPATH Setting in CONFIG.SYS
-------------------------------------------------

The MEMMAN setting in CONFIG.SYS must enable swapping for the SWAPPATH setting to
be acknowledged at all (typically, the command is "MEMMAN=SWAP" or
"MEMMAN=SWAP,MOVE").

The default SWAPPATH setting when OS/2 is first installed is usually as follows:

   SWAPPATH=C:\OS2\SYSTEM 512

The file specification indicates the drive and directory where the swap file is
allocated. If the CONFIG.SYS file does not contain a SWAPPATH variable, the
swapper allocates space in the root directory on the boot drive. The numeric
parameter indicates the amount of free space that must remain on this drive when
the swap file grows to its maximum size. (By itself, this number does not
indicate the maximum size of the swap file.) Given the SWAPPATH statement above,
the maximum size of the swap file is calculated as follows:

   (free space on drive C) - 512K = (maximum swap file size)

Therefore, increasing the value in the SWAPPATH statement DECREASES the amount of
memory available for the swap file.

You can decrease the value in the SWAPPATH setting and the system allows values
as low as 0 (zero). However, because OS/2 shares processor time between
processes and may need to write to the disk that contains the swap file,
decreasing the SWAPPATH value below 512K (the system default) is not
recommended. Reduce the value only if the SWAPPATH statement specifies a value
greater than 512K (the valid range is 0 to 32,767). If this is the case, use a
text editor to edit CONFIG.SYS and set the SWAPPATH value to Shutdown and reboot
the machine.

If the problem persists, you must delete files from the hard disk that contains
the swap file.
