TITLE   :FIX: LINK 5.02 Should Not Be Used with ILINK 1.1
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.02
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS, version 5.02 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the LINK utility version 5.02, which comes as a secondary linker for QuickC
version 2.0, is used with ILINK version 1.1, which also comes with QuickC 2.0,
floating-point values printed with the printf() function may be printed
incorrectly within the QuickC environment. Outside of the environment, the same
executable may result in math error M6104.

RESOLUTION
==========

LINK version 4.06 should be used if ILINK is also used. If it is necessary to
use version 5.02 of the linker, incremental linking should be disabled from
within the environment.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the LINK utility version 5.02.
This problem was corrected in the LINK utility version 5.03.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The source code below incorrectly prints "FP = 0.00000" instead of "FP =
5.020000".

Sample Code
-----------

   // Compile options needed: none

   #include <stdio.h>

   void main( void )
   {
      float fp = 5.02F;
      printf( "FP = %f\n", fp );
   }
