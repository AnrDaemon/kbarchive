======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After you save a graphic message from Microsoft Mail using the Save As button in
the Read Image window, the graphic does not appear in the resulting document
when it is opened in a word processor.

The graphic does not appear because Microsoft Mail saves files in text format;
that is, only alphanumeric characters are saved. Because a graphic is not a text
character, it is lost when the mail message is saved. This is true for the
default Mail Image form or for any other customized form that contains graphic
objects.

To save a graphic, copy it into the Clipboard, then paste the Clipboard contents
into the Scrapbook or into an application that accepts the graphic. Microsoft
Word, Microsoft Works, Microsoft File, Microsoft PowerPoint, and Microsoft Write
will accept a graphic from the Clipboard.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Mail messages are saved in text format because this format can be read by a
large number of word-processing programs. This feature makes Mail compatible
with a large software base.
