SUMMARY
=======

The getchar() function will wait for a carriage return even if setbuf() is used
to unbuffer stdin.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The function setbuf() affects a stream file buffer, such as stdin, but has no
effect on the keyboard or MS-DOS device buffers. The stream I/O function
getchar() can read a character from the keyboard buffer only when the keyboard
buffer is flushed by either being filled, by a carriage return, or by an
interrupt 0x21, function 0xC call.

To read normal characters directly from the keyboard, you can use the console I/O
function getch(). To read control codes such as ALT+Q (echo subsequent output to
printer) or ALT+R (pause output), you can use the _bios_keybrd() function. For
more information on this function, query on the following word in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   _bios_keybrd()

The following example demonstrates the difference between using getchar() and
getch().

Sample Code
-----------

   /* Compile options needed: none
   */ 

   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <conio.h>

   void main (void)

   {
      setbuf (stdin, NULL);        /* cause stdin to be unbuffered */ 
      if (getchar () != EOF )
         printf ("getchar() still waits for return key\n");
      if (getch () != EOF )
         printf ("getch() does not wait for return key\n");
   }
