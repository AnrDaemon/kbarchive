======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When hardware inventory from a Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) version
1.2 client is passed from an SMS 1.2 child site to an SMS 2.0 parent site, the
Last Login Name, Domain Name, and MAC Address fields in the Management
Information Format (MIF) file are ignored by the SMS 2.0 Data Loader and are not
written to the database as expected.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, use the SMS 1.2 site to query for Last Login Name,
Domain Name, and MAC Addresses.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
