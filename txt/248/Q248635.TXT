TITLE   :XADM: Recommended Install Order for Exchange, Cluster, and SP's
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The order that Exchange Server, Windows NT, Cluster Server, and their associated
service packs are installed in is very important. If you do not install these
components in the recommended order, your systems may be unable to perform some
functions.

Following is the recommended order of installation:

1. Install Windows NT version 4.0 on the first node in the cluster.

2. Finish the installation by applying Windows NT Service Pack 3 from the
   Enterprise Edition CD.

3. Install Windows NT version 4.0 on the second node in the cluster.

4. Finish the installation by applying Windows NT Service Pack 3 from the
   Enterprise Edition CD.

5. Install Cluster Server from the Windows NT Enterprise Edition CD on both
   nodes.

6. Apply the current Windows NT service pack to both nodes in the cluster.

NOTE: You must apply a Windows NT service pack that is later than Windows NT
Service Pack 3. Exchange Server requires a post-Windows NT Service Pack 3
roll-up fix to work properly.

7. Install Exchange Server version 5.5 on the first node in the cluster.

8. To update the second node in the cluster, insert the Exchange Server 5.5
   setup CD and select Update Node.

9. Apply the current Exchange Server 5.5 Exchange Service Pack to the first node
   in the cluster.

10. Update the second node in the cluster by inserting the Exchange Service Pack
   CD and select Update Node.

If Cluster Server and Exchange Server are already installed and a service pack
needs to be reapplied, or a newer service pack needs to be installed, apply the
Windows NT service packs to each node in the cluster before you apply any
Exchange Server updates to either node.
