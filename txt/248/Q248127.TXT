SUMMARY
=======

When you use Outlook to work offline your public free and busy information is
not updated to the server when you synchronize your folders.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Public free and busy updates are client-side operations that are only initiated
when you work online. When you are logged on to the network your public free and
busy information is updated at a specified interval; the server has no part in
this process. The Calendar folder is synchronized when you work offline and
click Send and Receive or Synchronize. However, free and busy information is not
updated during either of these processes. The only workaround is to connect
(on-line mode) to your mailbox and either wait for the specified interval to
publish free and busy data or just exit and logoff, which forces the client to
write free and busy data to the server. To update free and busy information on
the server, you must log on to the network; either connect to a local area
network (LAN) or initiate a Dial-Up Networking connection before you open
Outlook.
