SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to migrate e-mail messages from a Novell GroupWise
5.x mailbox to an existing Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 mailbox.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To migrate e-mail messages to an existing mailbox, you need to create a
secondary proxy GroupWise address on the mailbox that you want to migrate the
messages to. This address must match the GroupWise address of the user's mail
that you want to migrate the messages from.

To migrate e-mail messages to an existing mailbox:

1. Start the Exchange Server Migration Wizard and click "Migrate from Novell
   GroupWise 5.x".

2. When a dialog box is displayed that asks which migration procedure you want
   to perform, click "Extract Migration Files only".

3. Select the users that you want to migrate when you are prompted to do so.

4. When a dialog box is displayed that asks what information you would like to
   migrate, click to clear the "Information to create mailboxes" check box.

5. Complete the migration.
