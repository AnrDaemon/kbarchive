TITLE   :An Error Occurred Reading or Setting a Configuration Parameter

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Transaction Server 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a Web application or change the settings of a Web application
from a remote computer using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), the
following error message may occur:

   An error occurred reading or setting a configuration parameter (80080005).

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when the identity of the Transaction Server Package is set to
"Interactive User." The interactive user is the user that is currently logged on
to the server (that is, the computer that hosts the Transaction Server Package).
When this user logs off, the components in the Transaction Server Package cannot
be created and executed, and an error message is returned.

This behavior is by design.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set the package identity to a specific user with the necessary access rights.
