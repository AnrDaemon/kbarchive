TITLE   :PRB: OLE Automation: CheckOut Recursive Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Visual SourceSafe OLE Automation to check out a project
object with the recursive flag set, all files are checked out recursively.
However, the local files for any subprojects will not be on the local computer.

CAUSE
=====

The files in the subprojects are copied only to the working directory if the
VSSFLAG_FORCEDIRYES flag is set.

This flag is a parameter of the VSSITEM.Checkout command.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you check out the project recursively by using OLE Automation, use the
VSSFLAG_FORCEDIRYES flag.
