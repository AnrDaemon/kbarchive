======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++.NET (2002) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you call a method on a COM server from an MFC COM client application and if
the method takes a long time to process and return back, you won't be able to do
anything on the client application and the OLE Server Busy dialog box pops up.
This article explains how you can increase the time-out period of the COM call
and also shows you how to avoid this dialog box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Ensure that the MFC client application is calling AfxOleInit() to initialize
COM. This is important, because AfxOleInit() also initializes and registers a
COleMessageFilter data member in the CWinApp. Alternatively, you can create your
own COleMessageFilter object and register that during the startup.

Use

   AfxOleGetMessageFilter()->SetMessagePendingDelay(nTimeout);

to set the wait period on outgoing COM calls. If the COM call takes longer than
nTimeout milliseconds, then the MFC Client application displays the OLE Server
Busy dialog box.

Use,

   AfxOleGetMessageFilter()->EnableNotRespondingDialog(FALSE);

to disable the Not Responding dialog box, which is displayed if a keyboard or
mouse message is pending during an OLE call and the call has timed out.

Use

   AfxOleGetMessageFilter()->EnableBusyDialog(FALSE);

to disable the busy dialog box from appearing after the COM call times out.

Another way to suppress the server busy dialog box is to use OleInitialize and
OleUninitialize instead of AfxOleInit in your application.
