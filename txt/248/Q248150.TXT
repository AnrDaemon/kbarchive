PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,2.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbMMC kbServer kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbPackage kbsmsAdmin kbSoftwareDist kbsms200s

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Systems Management Server (SMS) in a three-tier hierarchy, package
status as viewed at the middle-tier site may be inaccurate for the third-level
child site.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when you create a package at the central site in a
three-tier hierarchy. When you view the package status from the middle-tier
site's Administrator console, it indicates that the package has not been
received. However, the information is correctly presented at the central site.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A three-tier hierarchy is shown in the following example:

   CEN (central site)
    |
   MID (middle tier)
    |
   BOT (third tier - this is usually a secondary site)

In this situation, the package status for a package created at CEN for deployment
to site BOT is not accurate when viewed from the Administrator console at the
MID site.
