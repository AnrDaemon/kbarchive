======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A cryptographic error in the Syskey tool makes offline password attacks easier
than previously believed. Syskey reuses keystream when encrypting certain
elements in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) database, making the tool
vulnerable to an attack using a known cryptanalytic method. This vulnerability
could allow offline password attacks to be mounted against a Syskey-protected
SAM database.

CAUSE
=====

Passwords in the SAM database are stored in hashed form to prevent a user who
gains access to the database from reading the passwords. However, offline
password attacks are still possible if an attacker obtains a copy of the
database and is willing to devote the time needed to perform an exhaustive
search of all possible passwords. The Syskey tool is designed to prevent such
attacks by strongly encrypting the SAM database using 128-bit cryptography.
However, a flaw in the implementation results in multiple database entries being
encrypted with the same keystream. This renders the encryption susceptible to a
known attack.
