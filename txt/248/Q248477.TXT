======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Standard C++ Library, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Two threads can deadlock when one thread uses a map, multimap, set, or multiset
class member that waits for a second thread and that uses another run-time
object that requires synchronization.

CAUSE
=====

The _Tree class in the <xtree> STL header, the basic data structure used
for map and set, uses the same critical section to protect _Tree static data
members as other run-time objects use to protect their private data.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the architecture of your application so that two threads do not use C
run-time objects that use the same critical section. For instance, if your
object contained in a map has a destructor that waits for a second thread to
create an ostream derived-class, then change the architecture so that the
destructor does not need to wait for the ostream-derived class to be
constructed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the latest service pack for
