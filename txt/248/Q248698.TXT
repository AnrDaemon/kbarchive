-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are shutting down Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, the following error message
may appear:

   MPRSHUT.EXE - DLL initialization hung
   Initialization of the dynamic link library c:\winnt\system32\kernel32.dll
   failed

The system then shuts down normally.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the RSA ACE software by Security Dynamics is in
use. The ACE readme files document this error as a 'non-injurious' error.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, shut down the ACE software before you shut down
the computer.
