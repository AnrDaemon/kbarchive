SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to access an Internet resource, one of the following error
messages may be displayed in the Web browser:

   HTTP 403.13 Forbidden: Client certificate revoked

   The page requires a valid client certificate

CAUSE
=====

An HTTP 403.13 error message is returned when a resource that the user is
attempting to access requires a valid client Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
certificate that the server recognizes. This client SSL certificate must be
installed in the Web browser, because it is used for authenticating the user of
that browser as a valid user of the resource.

The error message can also occur if IIS is unable to contact the server that
stores the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) when checking for revoked
certificates. If a CRL server is unreachable, the certificates are presumed to
be revoked.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the Web browser that is displaying the error, install a certificate from a
recognized Certificate Authority (CA). If a certificate from a valid CA is
installed, then contact that CA to verify the certificate has not been revoked,
and that their CRL store is online.

If the certificate was created with Microsoft's Certificate Server, you will want
to verify that the IIS server is able to directly see the Certificate Server.
You can verify the path under the CRL Distribution Points and verify that the
path is accessible from the IIS server. To do this, follow these steps:

1. In the Certificates Snap-in, expand Certificates, and then expand Personal.

2. Under the Certificates folder, double-click the certificate you are
   verifying, and then click the Details tab.

3. Verify the paths under the CRL Distribution Points.

4. Check the paths by trying to access them through Windows Explorer, (from
   Start, click Run or Internet Explorer).

5. If the paths are not accessible from the IIS server, then it is necessary to
   rectify the connection to allow the IIS server to connect to the Certificate
   Server.
