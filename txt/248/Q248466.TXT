SUMMARY
=======

A file that is currently checked out from SourceSafe may not be replaced when
users perform a Get on the file, even if they choose the Replace option that is
presented by SourceSafe.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a file is checked out and edited from SourceSafe and users attempt to
perform a Get on the file, SourceSafe detects that the file is already checked
out.

SourceSafe then asks the users whether they want to replace the copy of the file
in their working directory with the version of the file being retrieved from
SourceSafe.

If the users choose the Replace button, the expected behavior is for SourceSafe
to replace the copy of the file in the their working directory with the copy of
the file that is retrieved from SourceSafe. However, occasionally this does not
happen.

When users verify that they want to replace one version of the file with another,
SourceSafe compares the timestamp information for the two versions of the file.
If the timestamps differ by less than one second, the working directory copy is
not replaced.

This is a timing issue with SourceSafe. If there is a time period greater than
one second, the above procedure works as expected.

This issue is by design.
