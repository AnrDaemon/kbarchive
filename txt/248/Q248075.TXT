======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When connecting to Internet Information Services using a browser, you may
receive the following error:

   HTTP 403.12 - Access Forbidden: Mapper denied access

   The page requires a valid client certificate
   The page you are trying to view requires the use of a valid client
   certificate. Your client certificate map has been denied access to this Web
   site.

CAUSE
=====

Generic 403 errors are returned when access to the content has been forbidden.
The server is refusing to fulfill the request for content. This is generally not
related to permissions.

Error 403.12 states that access to the content is not available and that the
server requires a valid client certificate that has not been denied access.

The User ID mapped to the client certificate has been denied access to the
resource.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

 - Check the effective date on the client certificate and ensure that the
   certificate is valid.

 - Check the expiration date and ensure that the certificate has not expired.

 - Check with the Certificate Authority that provided the certificate to see if
   your certificate has expired.

 - Verify that the certificate has not been explicitly denied access.

You can also resolve this problem by requesting a new certificate from the
Certificate Authority (either a Certificate Authority on the Internet or the
local Certificate Server) that the server requires.
