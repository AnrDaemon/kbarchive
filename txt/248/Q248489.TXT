PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to Microsoft Exchange Server as Administrator to create a site
connector between sites in different domains that are in a two-way trust, and
then enter the name of the remote server as the target site in the New Site
Connector dialog box, you may receive this message:

   DS_E_INSUFFICIENT_ACCESS_RIGHTS

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur when the account that you are using does not have
permissions to create site connectors.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Confirm that the Exchange Server service account is properly configured with
   the appropriate Microsoft Windows NT permissions.

2. Confirm that the service account has the Service Account Admin role at the
   site level on both sites. The service account should have this role on the
   Organization and Configuration containers as well.

3. Log off the current account, log on as the local service account, and then
   create the site connector.
