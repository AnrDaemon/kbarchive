TITLE   :BUG: Incorrect Symbols for Kerberos DLLs on Windows 2000

SYMPTOMS
========

When using symbols of Kerberos DLLs on Windows 2000, the debugger reports a
warning that there is a mismatch in the checksums between the symbol and the
corresponding executable image.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The symbol files of some Kerberos DLLs on Windows 2000 have incorrect checksums
in the headers. The following are the binaries which checksums are incorrect in
the corresponding symbol files.

 - Rsabase.dll

 - Dssbase.dll

 - Rsaenh.dll

 - Dssenh.dll

 - Gpkcsp.dll

 - Slbcsp.dll

 - Schannel.dll

 - Msv1_0.dll

 - Kerberos.dll

Even though the symbol file checksums are incorrect, the symbol information is
valid and can be used for debugging.

Also, the symbols of Kerberos.dll require the symbol path (sympath) to be set to
the DLL directory containing the symbol file. Usually the sympath will be set to
the symbols directory and the debuggers will look in the corresponding child
directories to find the symbol file. But in this situation only Kerberos.dll
requires the symbol path to point to the DLL directory.
