-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you uninstall Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6 (SP6) or Service Pack
6a (SP6a), some files are intentionally not removed or reverted back to the
version prior to SP6 or SP6a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Most of the files are not removed because changes that are made to Security
Accounts Manager (SAM) and the security registry hives that are not removed
require the SP6 or SP6a version of the files. You must not remove the files
after SP6 or SP6a is applied unless you fully restore your computer to its
previous installation of Windows NT 4.0.

The following files are not removed after you uninstall SP6 or SP6a:

   Certmgr.msc
   Comcat.dll
