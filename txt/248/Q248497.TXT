======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Proxy Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may see the following entries in Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 113
   Source: W3SVC
   Type: Warning
   Category: NoneDescription: Instance 1 has invalid binding descriptor X

   Event ID: 115
   Source: W3SVC
   Type: Error
   Category: None
   Description: The service could not bind instance 1. The data is the error
   code.

CAUSE
=====

These entries can be caused by invalid information in the Internet Information
Server (IIS) metabase for SecureBindings. The key is LM\W3SVC\1\SecureBindings.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, change the SecureBindings setting in the IIS metabase. To
do this, use the Metaedit tool included with the Microsoft Internet Information
Server Resource Kit. Change the value in the LM\W3SVC\1\SecureBindings key to a
valid port. This is typically 443, with ":" on each side of the port number.

You can also change the SecureBindings setting from a command prompt by typing
"adsutil set w3svc/1/SecureBindings :443:" (without the quotation marks) from
the Winnt\System32\Inetsrv\Adminsamples folder. Port 443 is the default port for
SecureBindings, but you can replace it with another port number.
