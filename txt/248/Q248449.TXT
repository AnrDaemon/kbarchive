======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

NetCopy.exe can be used to create a network installation point for the MSDN
Library. When running NetCopy and copying all MSDN Library files to a network
share, the following warning may incorrectly appear:

   Warning! The target location is formatted as a FAT drive. Due to the large
   number of files in MSDN, the target location may not have enough space.
   Please refer to the READMEDN.HTM file on Disc 1 for more information.

This message displays, even though the target network share is known to be using
the FAT32 file system.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can happen when the network share is on a Windows 2000 computer.
Setup is using GetVolumeInformation API to determine the file system type. The
GetVolumeInformation API incorrectly returns FAT instead of FAT32 when used on a
Windows 2000 FAT32 network share.

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify that the file system is FAT32:

1. Go to the actual target computer. Do not use the network share.

2. Use Windows Explorer to select the target drive.

3. Right-click on the drive letter, and select Properties.

4. Verify that the File System is FAT32.

After verifying that the target network share is on a FAT32 drive, you can safely
ignore the warning. If the target drive is not FAT32, please see the
READMEDN.htm file on Disc 1 of the MSDN Library for more information about the
potential problem.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The NetCopy.exe program first shipped with the January 2000 MSDN Library.
