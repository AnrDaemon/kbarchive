======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to a Web site through proxy server, the following
error may appear:

   HTTP/1.1
   407 Proxy Authentication Required

   You must authenticate with a proxy server before this request can be
   serviced.
   Please logon to your proxy server and then try again.

CAUSE
=====

This error is returned when you try to access a Web site through a proxy server
that has access control turned on while using Basic Authentication.

The Web Proxy, through a 407 HTTP response, requests credentials from the browser
client (or downstream Proxy Server). The client provides the credentials, or in
the case of a downstream Web proxy, the proxy server may provide the credentials
itself.

If the credentials used by the client or by the downstream proxy server are not
allowed by the upstream proxy server, this error will be displayed.

RESOLUTION
==========

This can be resolved by passing the correct credentials to the proxy server.
Contact the administrator of the proxy server and verify that the account has
permission to use the proxy server.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can also use the following workaround to resolve this issue:

 - Enable "Anonymous" authentication on the proxy server computer.
