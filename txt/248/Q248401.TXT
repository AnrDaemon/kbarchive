The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

The User May Override Mapping option is available in the Host Security Domain
properties in SNA Server Manager. If this option is disabled, a user is not
allowed to change the mapping for their User ID. The enforcement of the User May
Override Mapping option is handled in the Host Account Manager (Udconfig.exe)
program. This option is not enforced centrally by any of the other host security
components.

The following article discusses a problem with Host Account Manager that allows
the "Use This User ID" field to be edited even though the User May Override
Mapping option is disabled in the Host Security Domain:

   Q247320 User ID Can be Edited When User May Override Mapping Is Disabled

To provide more security when using previous versions of Host Account Manager,
and to prevent the problem described in the referenced article, a change has
been made to enforce the User May Override Mapping option centrally instead of
solely in the Host Account Manager program (which can be installed on Windows NT
or Windows 95/98 SNA Server clients).

The following list describes the central enforcement of the User May Override
Mapping option when you use various versions of the affected components:

 - Updated versions of Udconfig.exe, Snapmp.exe, and Snaudb.exe.

   When all of the updated components are used, Udconfig.exe verifies the user
   privilege before enabling the mapped User ID field. The Snapmp service sets a
   flag to TRUE if the client has Admin privileges. The Snaudb service checks
   this flag before making any updates to the host account cache database. In
   this scenario, administrators are the only ones that can change the host
   account mappings if the User May Override Mapping option is disabled.

 - Updated versions of Snapmp.exe and Snaudb.exe with previous versions of
   Udconfig.exe.

   If the Udconfig.exe file from SNA Server 4.0 SP3 or earlier is used, the "Use
   This User ID" field can be edited. A user can change the mapped User ID in
   Udconfig, and it appears that the change was made. However, the Snapmp and
   Snaudb services verify the user privilege. If the user has Admin privileges,
   the change is made in the host account cache database. If the user does not
   have Admin privileges, the change is not made in the host account cache
   database. Also, the following event is logged in the Application event log
   when the attempted change is not authorized:

   Event ID: 51
   Source: SNA Host Security
   Description: PMP could not validate the request.

 - Updated version of Snaudb.exe and previous versions of Snapmp.exe and
   Udconfig.exe.

   In this case, the Snaudb service verifies that no one, including the
   Administrator, can change the mapped user name. The service logs event ID 51
   (described above) in the Application event Log to note that the attempted
   change was unauthorized.
