======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to connect to a resource on the server the Web browser displays the
following error:

   HTTP 410 - Permanently not available

CAUSE
=====

The resource being accessed is not available on the Web server.

This error is reserved for use by the server administrator to let you know that
the resource that you have requested will no longer be available at the URL
(Uniform Resource Locator) used. This error should be used in instances where a
typical "HTTP 404 - Page Not Found" is not entirely correct because it is known
that the resource will never be available at the specified URL again.

WORKAROUND
==========

Contact the server administrator to find out the new URL for the resource, if
one is available.

Additional query words: IIS 5, http 410
