PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running many Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows 98, or
Microsoft Network 3.0 clients on your network over IPX, and the clients access
Windows NT-based servers by using Direct Hosting over IPX, you may receive "Stop
0x1E in Srv.sys" error messages on the server.


CAUSE
=====

Direct Hosting support is limited to 4,096 session IDs (SIDs), and Windows NT
does not handle exceeding this limit properly.
