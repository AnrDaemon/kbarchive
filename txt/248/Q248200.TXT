TITLE   :FS2000: Unable to See Landing Lights from the Cockpit
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdisplay fsim kbimu msgame

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 
 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 Professional Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you fly in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000, you may experience the
following symptoms:

 - You are unable to see the landing lights from the cockpit.

 - You are able to see the landing lights from one of the external views.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the internal view of the landing lights is not
available in Flight Simulator 2000.

Though available in earlier versions of Flight Simulator, this feature has been
removed from Flight Simulator 2000 to reduce the number of objects that need to
be rendered and to improve the performance of the program.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
