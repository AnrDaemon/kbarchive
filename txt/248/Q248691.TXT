-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The DDUPD utility in Visual SourceSafe 6.0 requires the user to provide the path
to the data folder, not the path to the Srcsafe.ini file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DDCONV utility can take as an argument either the path to the data folder
or, by using the -m switch, the path to the Srcsafe.ini file:

   " DDCONV ..\data

   DDCONV C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\VSS\Data

   DDCONV -m ..\SrcSafe.ini

   DDCONV -m C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\VSS\SrcSafe.ini "
   (without the quotation marks)

The DDUPD utility can only take the path to the data folder:

   " DDUPD ..\data

   DDUPD C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\VSS\Data " (without the
   quotation marks)
