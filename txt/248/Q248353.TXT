PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbKernBase kbOSWin2000 kbService kbDSupport kbGrpDSKernBase

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You have installed an auto-started service configured for a non-localsystem
account.
When the system is starting, the system pauses at the blank blue screen for ~90
seconds and then the logon prompt appears.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add the NWCWorkstation service as a dependency to your non-localsystem service.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Client Services for Netware (CSNW) is installed and the NWCWorkstation
   service isn't configured to run in a group (default for CSNW).

2. Another auto-start service is installed that runs in a non-LocalSystem
   account.

3. The Auto-start service from step 2 comes before NWCWorkstation service
   alphabetically in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Services

   or it belongs to a service load order group. (Services that belong to a load
   order group always start before a service that doesn't belong to a load order
   group.)

4. Restart the computer.
