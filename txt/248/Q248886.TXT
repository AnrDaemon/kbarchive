PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start your Windows 95-based computer, you may receive the following
error message:

   A Fatal Exception 0E has occurred at 0028:C0026416 in VXD IFSMGR (01) +
   00003672

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if your network contains only Windows 95-based computers
and several log on attempts occur at the same time.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, disable the browse server duties on all but one of the
computers in your network:

1. Right-click Network Neighborhood, and then click Properties.

2. On the Configuration tab, click the File And Printer Sharing For Microsoft
   Networks component, and then click Properties.

3. In the Property box, click Browse Master, and then click Disabled in the
   Value box.

4. Click OK.

NOTE: At least one computer in each workgroup must have the ability to become
themaster browse server. If browse server capability is disabled on all the
computers in a network, browse functionality is disabled. A network storm will
ensue as clients will be unable to locate the browse master and will force an
election.
