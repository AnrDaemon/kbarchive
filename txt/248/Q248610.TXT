This behavior can occur if the version of Microsoft DirectX required by the

RESOLUTION
==========

If you have a newly published game, the latest version of DirectX available at
the time of publishing is included with the game. To install this version:

1. Insert the game CD into the drive. If the game has more than one CD, insert
   the first CD or CD1.

2. If the game runs automatically, cancel or exit the window.

3. Double-click My Computer, right-click the game CD icon, and then select
   Install DirectX.

If after installing DirectX you still have the missing file error or do not have
the option to install DirectX from the CD, please download and install the
latest version of Microsoft DirectX from the following Microsoft Web site:
