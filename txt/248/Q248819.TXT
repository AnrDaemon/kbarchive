KEYWORDS:kbiis400

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the W3C Extended Log Format, Microsoft Internet Information Server
(IIS) 4.0 logs the number of bytes sent by the server to the client in the
sc-bytes field. However, if an HTTP request is cancelled when you are
downloading a file, the log file reflects the size of the file being transferred
and not the number of bytes that are actually sent to the client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
4.0.Microsoft is researching this problem and will post more information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base when it becomes available.
