TITLE   :IIS Fails to Run on a Sysprep Cloned System
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Personal Web Server version 4.0 for NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Internet Information Server (IIS) and Personal Web Server (PWS) services fail to
run on a system that was cloned by using SYSPREP. In addition, one of the
following error messages may occur when you try to use the IIS or PWS Microsoft
Management Console (MMC):

   Unable to enumerate files and directories because the following error
   occurred: The system cannot find the path specified.

-or-

   Invalid configuration error occurred reading or setting configuration
   parameter.

CAUSE
=====

Each Windows NT Server 4.0 system that is installed or cloned by using SYSPREP
has a unique machine key. When the IIS or PWS services are installed, the
computer-specific entries created in the metabase are encrypted by using a
session key, which is created from the unique machine key. Therefore, the cloned
system fails to decrypt certain parts of the cloned metabase, which are
essential in running the IIS and PWS services.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you must clone systems with IIS or PWS services installed, perform the
cloning on the base Windows NT system, and then use the Windows NT Option Pack
(NTOP) unattended installation as a post-clone activity.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
