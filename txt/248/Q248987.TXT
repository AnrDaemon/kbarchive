SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft Exchange Server recipient receives an e-mail message and their
Out of Office (OOF) rule is turned on, the OOF rule may not work. The recipient
may also be prompted to turn off the OOF rule every time that they start the
Microsoft Exchange client or Microsoft Outlook. Even after the recipient turns
off the OOF rule, the rule may still be turned on. (To see that this is so, the
recipient can view the Out of Office Assistant command on the Tools menu.)

CAUSE
=====

The recipient's mailbox may have the Prohibit Send option set to a limit that
has been reached.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program.

2. Open the recipient's mailbox properties.

3. On the Limits tab, increase the Prohibit Send value to allow the recipient to
   send e-mail messages successfully.

4. Log on to the recipient's mailbox and turn off the OOF rule.

5. On the Tools menu, click Out of Office Assistant to turn on the OOF rule
   again.
