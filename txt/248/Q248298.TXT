-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.2a, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to use the Microsoft Mail (MS Mail) Administrator program
(Admin.exe) to modify groups, the following error message is displayed:

   Notice 59: error accessing address file.

If you troubleshoot with the DOS mail client by selecting Compose, and then
selecting To, the following error message is displayed:

   Notice 83: Error obtaining postoffice address list. Try again.

CAUSE
=====

The Admin.nme and Adminshd.nme (Postoffice Address List) file sizes in the
postoffice Nme directory are 0 bytes.

RESOLUTION
==========

To rebuild the Postoffice Address List (POL):

1. Start the Gimport.exe utility (version 3.5e) by typing the following at a
   command prompt:

   gimport -r -d<post_office_drive> admin -p<password>

2. Start the Acctonme.exe utility.

3. Copy the new Admin.nme file to the Adminshd.nme file.

4. Recreate the groups by using either the MS Mail Administrator program or the
   Gimport utility.

5. Use either the MS Mail Administrator program or the Import utility to add any
   external users back to the POL, because they were lost in the POL rebuild.

6. To update the global address list with the new POL addresses, start the
   Rebuild utility by typing the following at a command prompt:

   rebuild -f -d<post_office_drive>
