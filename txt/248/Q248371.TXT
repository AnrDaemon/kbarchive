TITLE   :Network Connection Is Not Closed When You Log Off
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0 SP4,4.0 SP5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you log off from a Terminal Server session, not all network connections
and files are closed correctly. This is most noticeable for users that connect
to network share points (with a restricted number of user connections) and then
log off and back on in quick succession. Subsequent attempts to connect to the
share are rejected because of the maximum connection limit being reached,
despite there appearing to be less users than the limit connected.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when you have dormant files on a connection at log off,
causing a connection to not be terminated correctly. Note that this problem only
affects Windows NT Terminal Server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Support for Dormant files is a redirector optimization where files which the
client has closed are not actually closed on the server until a short period of
time later (usually about 30 seconds). This is in case the client re-opens the
file. This optimization enables the file to be re-opened very quickly and
reduces network overhead.
