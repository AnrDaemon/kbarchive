TITLE   :XCCC: Mailbox Access Across Domains Is Denied Through OWA
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Outlook Web Access (OWA) to gain access to Microsoft Exchange
Server 5.5 in another domain, you may receive one of the following error
messages indicating that access is denied:

   Failed to get Inbox

   OWA was unable to get your inbox

   Access is Denied

All users who are members of the same domain as the Exchange Server computer can
access their mail through OWA, but no one in your domain is able to do so. The
domains are in a two-way trust relationship.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when users in the remote domain do not belong to a local
group in the domain where the Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS)
computer is located and have not been granted the right to log on locally.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, add the global group of OWA users to the local group in
the local domain, and assign the correct permissions:

1. Create a global group in the remote domain and then add all of the OWA users.

2. Create a local group, in the local domain, on the IIS computer.

3. Add the global group from the remote domain to the local group in the local
   domain.

4. Assign the new local group the right to Log On Locally and "Access this
   computer from the network".
