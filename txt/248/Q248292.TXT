The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5

SUMMARY
=======

If you use Outlook 97, Outlook 98, or Outlook 2000, when you reply to or forward
a message in the Inbox, a banner is added to the original message that indicates
you replied to or forwarded the message. However, this time and date banner on
the message may not reflect the actual date and time that you replied to or
forwarded the message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you reply to or forward a message, if you set some send options for the
message (for example, on the File menu, click Properties, click Send Options,
click the Microsoft Exchange Server tab, and then under "Send this item", click
In and type a number of minutes to delay the message), Outlook automatically
adds the appropriate banner to the original message. However, Outlook flags the
message before you actually reply to or forward the message. If you decide to
end the process, this date-and-time banner is not removed. This gives you the
erroneous impression that you replied to or forwarded the message, even though
you didn't finish the operation.
