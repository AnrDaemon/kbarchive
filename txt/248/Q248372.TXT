TITLE   :Incorrect User Name When Using Office 97 Applications
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to access a Microsoft Office Suite file [for example, Microsoft
Excel (.xls), Microsoft Word (.doc), or Microsoft PowerPoint (.ppt)] that has
been opened by another user on another terminal server client, you may receive a
read-only dialog box that displays the name of the user who installed the
program. The dialog box should display the name of the user who opened the file.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition requires
special installation (available in application server mode) to install programs
for multiple users. This service is activated when you use the Add/Remove
Programs tool in Control Panel, or the "Change User /Install" command to install
a program. If you use the command, you must return to normal execution mode. To
do this, run the "Change User /Execute" command after you install the program.

When you use Office 97 programs for the first time, you are prompted for your
user name and initials. This information is then contained in the registry.

However, you can modify the default settings before you run the "Change User
/Execute" command. When you make changes, you are presented with the same
request to provide a user name and initials before you open the program. When
you return to normal execution mode, the default settings you created (including
the user name) become the default settings for all users.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition time-stamps all
installation changes to default settings in the registry. For the user's default
settings to be changed, the program must be removed, and then reinstalled, even
if the user has opened the program in the past. The user's default settings are
changed the next time they access the program during a Terminal Services
session.

If changes are made only to the registry key values, then only new users'
settings are changed. Changes to values do not affect users who have already
accessed the program and have the default settings stored in their profile.
