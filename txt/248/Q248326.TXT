To work around this issue, reduce graphics hardware acceleration:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. Click the Performance tab, and then click Graphics.

   NOTE: If you encounter any problems after you reduce graphics hardware
   acceleration, follow these steps to restore graphics hardware acceleration to

      your operating system.

      Restart your computer, press and hold down the CTRL key after your computer
      completes the Power On Self Test (POST), and then choose Safe Mode from
      the Startup menu.

      Microsoft Windows 95:

      Restart your computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message,
      press the F8 key, and then choose Safe Mode from the Startup menu.

   b. When Windows starts in Safe mode, click OK.
