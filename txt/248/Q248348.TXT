KEYWORDS:kbRegistry kbVBp600 kbWebClasses kbGrpDSASP kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Calls to the SaveSetting, GetSetting, DeleteSetting or GetAllSettings methods in
a Visual Basic 6.0 WebClass [Internet Information Server (IIS) Application]
return the following errors in the Application log of the Windows NT Event
Viewer:

   Application-defined or object-defined error

   -and-

   The VB Application identified by the event source logged this Application
   Project1: Thread ID: 317 ,Logged: MsgBox , Run-time error '5': Invalid
   procedure call or argument

CAUSE
=====

The SaveSetting, GetSetting, DeleteSetting, and GetAllSettings methods in Visual
Basic are not available in Visual Basic 6.0 WebClasses (IIS Applications) when
running in a compiled state. You should not use these methods in your WebClass
applications.

Visual Basic 6.0 WebClasses run under the Internet Information Server service.
SaveSetting, GetSetting, DeleteSetting, and GetAllSettings manage registry keys
in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry hive. The Internet Information Server service
does not have an HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry hive available. As a result, the
error occurs when calling these methods.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you need to read and write to the registry, you need to write to and read
from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE or HKEY_USERS, which are available to the Internet
Information Server service. You may use the Windows Script Host for this
purpose, or another component that provides this functionality.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is sample Windows Script Host code to read and write from the
registry:

   Private Sub WebClass_Start()
       Dim objWSH As Object
       
       Set objWSH = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
       
       objWSH.RegWrite "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\MyApplication\strValue", "Some string value"
       objWSH.RegWrite "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\MyApplication\strReg\", 1, "REG_DWORD"

       Response.Write objWSH.RegRead("HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\MyApplication\strValue") & "<P>"
       Response.Write objWSH.RegRead("HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\MyApplication\strReg\") & "<P>"
       
       objWSH.RegDelete "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\MyApplication\strValue"
       objWSH.RegDelete "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\MyApplication\strReg\"
       objWSH.RegDelete "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\MyApplication\"
   End Sub
