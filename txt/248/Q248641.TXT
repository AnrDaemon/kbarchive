TITLE   :Clients Cannot Browse Through Proxy Server with Demand Dial
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Proxy Server version 1.0 
 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use a Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0-based client to
browse by using a demand dial interface through a proxy server, you may not
succeed. Also, you may not be able to terminate the demand dialing feature from
a client although auto-dial configuration and Internet connections on the
clients are all correct. When the demand dial interface terminates
automatically, all clients are able to browse.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the proxy settings on the Small Business Server
(SBS) and on the client's Internet Explorer (IE) are incorrect.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, disable Winsock proxy client at the SBS and then
enable IE Internet options for the proxy server.
