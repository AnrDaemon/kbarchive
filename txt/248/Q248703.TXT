TITLE   :Multiple Separator Pages with Win95 Client and NT4 Print Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95; winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print from a Microsoft Windows 95-based client computer to a Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0-based print server, multiple separator pages may show up in the
queue and in the print output, although neither the client nor the server is
configured to use extra separator pages.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when you run McAfee VirusScan 95 version 2.x on the
Windows 95-based client.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, upgrade the Windows 95-based client to McAfee VirusScan
95 version 3.0 or later. To work around this behavior, disable use of separator
pages on both the client and the print server.
