KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 1100 printer attached to a port on
a server running Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 with a shared queue, clients
running Microsoft Windows 98 may not be able to print to this printer. The print
jobs appear in the queue, and a message states that the job is printed, but no
output appears at the printer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the driver for an HP LaserJet 5L printer is not
installed at both the Windows NT-based server and the Windows 98-based client.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, install the driver for an HP LaserJet 5L printer on
both the Windows NT-based server and the Windows 98-based client computer.
