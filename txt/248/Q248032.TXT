SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to a Web server using a Web browser, such as Microsoft Internet
Explorer, you may receive the following error message:

   You are not authorized to view this page.
   You do not have permission to view this directory or page from the Internet
   address of your Web browser.

   Please try the following:

   If you believe you should be able to view this directory or page, please
   contact the Web site administrator by using the e-mail address or phone
   number listed on the file:// home page.

   HTTP 403.8 - Forbidden: Site access denied Internet Information Services

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because the server has a list of DNS names that are not
allowed to access the site, and the DNS name you are using is in this list.

RESOLUTION
==========

Have the Web site administrator remove your client's DNS name from the DNS
restrictions on the IIS computer. To do this, open the properties on the Default
Web Site or the Web site in question:

1. Click the Directory Security tab.

2. Under IP Address and Domain name restrictions, click Edit.

3. Select the domain name that you want to remove in the Restrictions box.

4. Click Remove.

5. Do this for each domain that you want to remove.

NOTE: IP and Domain restrictions can also be set in the Master properties. You
may have to perform the above steps under Master properties. To enter Master
properties, right-click the server name in the Internet Services Manager and
choose Properties. In the Master Properties box, click Edit.
