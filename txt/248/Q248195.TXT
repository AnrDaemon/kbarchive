TITLE   :XFOR: Config. Interoperability w. cc:Mail 8.5 32-bit Executables
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbinterop kbsetup exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade a cc:Mail post office to version 8.5, if you use the 16-bit
versions of the Import.exe and Export.exe files, the Lotus cc:Mail post office
is corrupted.

This article provides a procedure that enables Exchange Server to run with the
32-bit executables that are required for compatibility with Lotus cc:Mail
version 8.5.

CAUSE
=====

Exchange Server is designed to work with the 16-bit executables, the Import.exe
and Export.exe files, of cc:Mail versions earlier than 8.5. When Lotus
introduced cc:Mail 8.5, it switched to 32-bit executables, the Import32.exe and
Export32.exe files, and the supporting dynamic link libraries, the Cdmw800.dll,
Cfw803.dll, and Ciw803.dll files.

RESOLUTION
==========

To run the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail with the new cc:Mail
8.5 post office:

1. Stop the Connector for cc:Mail.

2. Rename the Import32.exe and Export32.exe files to Import.exe and Export.exe,
   respectively.

3. Copy the Import.exe, Export.exe, Cdmw800.dll, Cfw803.dll, and Ciw803.dll
   files to a directory that is in the path of the Exchange Server computer, for
   example, the Winnt directory.

4. Copy the Impexp.ri file to the <drive>\Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata directory.

5. Restart the Connector for cc:Mail.

The connector functions normally, that includes directory synchronization.

Additional query words: upgrade, synchronize import exe export cdmw800 dll cfw803 ciw803
