TITLE   :Invoking COMTI Method Results in 1533 Exception Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0 SP2,4.0 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, versions 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an automation client attempts to call a COM Transaction Integrator for CICS
and IMS (COMTI) method that contains a variable length ADO recordset nested in a
user-defined type (UDT), An exception error occurs on completion of the method
call. One of the following Windows NT events may be posted by COMTI to the
Windows NT Application event log when this problem occurs:

   (1533) An error occurred when attempting to read the actual size of
   information for the safearray parameter RESPONSE_DATA in method CaseList.

   (1564) An error occurred when attempting to acquire the allow variable length
   property for parameter PARAMETER1 in method V100c.

CAUSE
=====

COMTI does not properly handle recordsets that are nested in User Defined Types
(UDTs).

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0 service pack that contains this
fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

+--------------------------------+
| File Name   | Date     | Time  | 
+--------------------------------+
| Convert.dll | xx/xx/xx | xx:xx | 
+--------------------------------+

NOTE: Date and time information will be provided as soon as it becomes
available.


NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.



WORKAROUND
==========

Replace nested recordsets with UDTs.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version
4.0SP2 and 4.0SP3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following IMS Cobol output area is a valid structure, which can be mapped to
data-types represented in the COM world by using the Component Builder (CB) tool
in COMTI. During the construction of the type library, the administrator will
more than likely choose to represent the level 30 paragraph below with either a
recordset or a UDT. If a recordset is used, COMTI throws an exception,
considering that the recordset is nested in a UDT defined in paragraph 20 and
10.
