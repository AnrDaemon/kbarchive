The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If two users save changes to the same item in a public folder replica,
notification messages are not sent to the owner of the folder or to the
mailboxes that created the conflict.

A conflict icon is displayed in the public folder, but no notification messages
are generated. This behavior is different than the behavior that occurs if the
conflict originates on the home server of the public folder. For additional
information about this behavior, click the article number below to view the
