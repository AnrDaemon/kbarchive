KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbtool kbsms200 kbsms200bug smsinst kbsms200sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Systems Management Server (SMS) Installer version 2.0.91.00 included with
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1) may generate the following
error message during the Repackage process of the Installer:

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   SMSINS32 caused an invalid page fault in module SMSINS32.EXE at xxxx:yyyyyyyy

Note that this symptom is specific to Microsoft Windows 98/95.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the program being repackaged creates multiple empty
folders during the repackage process, and then forces a reboot before the
repackage post scan. When these conditions exist and you click Finish, the SMS
Installer does not work correctly, and generates the error message listed
earlier in this article.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
