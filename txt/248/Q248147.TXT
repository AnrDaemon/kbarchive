TITLE   :PRB: Cannot Cycle Through Pageframe Controls with Tab Key
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport kbCodeSnippet kbGrpDSFox kbOOP kbContainer kbCtrl kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When tabbing through the controls on a pageframe with the TabStop property of
the pageframe set to false, you cannot reach the first control by pressing tab
on the last control. You have to press Shift + Tab keys to get back to the first
control.

RESOLUTION
==========

Include the following code in the LostFocus event of the last control:

   This.Parent.controlname.SetFocus

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using the arrow keys to move between objects on the pageframe produces the same
behavior.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Place a pageframe on a form.

2. Place at least two text boxes and two command buttons on any page of the
   pageframe.

3. Change the TabStop property of the pageframe to .f.

4. Run the form.

5. Click on first control and tab through until you have reached the last
   control.

6. Pressing tab again does not bring focus to the first control.
