SYMPTOMS
========

After an online restoration of the directory service and the information store
on a test server, the Exchange Server Information Store service may not start
and a specific error 4015 may occur.

The following error messages may be logged in the Application event log:

   Event ID: 5000
   Source: MSExchangeIS
   Type: Error
   Category: General
   Description:
   Unable to initialize the Microsoft Exchange Information Store service. Error

   Event ID: 1121
   Source: MSExchangeIS
   Type: Error
   Category: General
   Description:
   Error 0xfaf connecting to the Microsoft Exchange Server Directory Service.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the server is renamed after Exchange Server
installation; some values in the MSExchangeIS key contain the name of the test
server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, make sure that the name of the Exchange Server computer
matches the server name that is used in the DSA Computer, MTA Computer, and This
Server values in the MSExchangeIS key.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To make sure that the name of the Exchange Server computer matches the server
name that is used in the DSA Computer, MTA Computer, and This Server values:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersSystem

3. Note the server name that is used in the following values:

    - DSA Computer

    - MTA Computer

    - This Server

4. Quit Registry Editor.

5. Use one of the following steps, as applicable:

    - Rename the computer that is running Microsoft Windows 2000 Server or
      Microsoft Windows NT Server, and install Exchange Server 5.5 again.

    - Change the registry values in step 3 to match the correct server name.
