TITLE   :XADM: Dirsync Requestor Updates Not Sent After Upgrade to SP3
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade Exchange Server to Service Pack 3 (SP3), the Exchange
directory synchronization (dirsync) requestor does not send out updates to the
dirsync server.

CAUSE
=====

Service Pack 3 adds a new directory schema object to the Directory
Synchronization Agent (DXA) that allows additional containers to be selected.
These new containers are then checked for updates to be sent to the dirsync
server. However, the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program has not
been properly modified to handle this new attribute, so the containers are
incorrectly added to the wrong attribute. Therefore, the DXA is unable to obtain
a list of containers to check for updates.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.
