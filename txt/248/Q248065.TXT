SUMMARY
=======

If you use different catalogs on Index Server, you can query only the default
catalog for "Unfiltered Documents" using the HTML Index Server Administration.
By default you cannot query for "Unfiltered Documents" from another catalog,
however, for some administrative issues this query might be useful.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To search for "Unfiltered Documents" in a catalog different from the default
catalog you need to change the Unfilt.idq script from HTML Index Server
Administration, which is located in the following:

<WINNT>\system32\inetsrv\iisadmin\isadmin\unfilt.idq

Proceed the following steps to customize Unfilt.idq:

1. Create a backup copy of Unfilt.idq.

2. Edit and change the following line in Unfilt.idq:

   # CiCatalog=d:\ 

   to

   CiCatalog=<Catalog Location>

   Where <Catalog Location> is the current location of the catalog you want
   to query. You will find the location value for the catalog in the MMC Snap-in
   "Index Server on Local Machine" in the right pane under "Location". You are
   free to use the location value or the catalog name.

   For example:

   The Catalog Location is D:\test and the Catalog Name is testcatalog.
   Therefore you can use: CiCatalog=D:\test or CiCatalog=testcatalog.

3. Save unfilt.idq.
