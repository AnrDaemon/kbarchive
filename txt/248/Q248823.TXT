KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use a remote Microsoft Windows NT 4.0-based server or
workstation as an Administrator console to manage a Systems Management Server
(SMS) site without the distributed version of Component Object Model (COM)
enabled on the computer, the following error message occurs when you attempt to
connect:

   Connection Failed

You can identify this behavior by examining the Wbemprox.log file and searching
for the following text:

   Error loading module {F7CE2E13-8C90-11D1-9E7B-00C04FC324A8}, return code is
   0x80070005(Fri Dec 17 14:21:41 1999) :
   ConnectViaDCOM, CoCreateInstanceEx resulted in hr = 0x80070005(Fri Dec 17
   14:21:41 1999) :

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if COM is disabled on the computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. Start Dcomcnfg.exe in the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder.

2. If the COM components have not been registered, you receive two prompts to
   register them. Click Yes for both prompts.

3. On the Default Properties tab, verify that "Enable Distributed COM for this
   computer" is selected.

4. Click OK.

After you make this change, start the SMS Administrator console again.

STATUS
======
