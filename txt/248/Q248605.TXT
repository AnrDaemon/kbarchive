TITLE   :Cluster IP Address Resource Fails with Many IP Address Resources
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create many IP address resources with the "Enable Netbios" option
enabled, one or more resources may fail if the total number of Netbios enabled
addresses on the system exceeds 64.

In Event Viewer, you may see the following event ID:

   Event ID 1044
   Source: Cluster Svc
   Text: Cluster IP Address could not create the required Netbios interface.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because Netbios has a table limit of 64 IP Addresses. In
most cases, this number of IP addresses might be used for World Wide Web or FTP
resources which do not require an entry in the Netbios table.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, allow the "Enable Netbios" option to be checked only
on IP Address resources that have a Network Name resource dependent on it, or
when the address is used with Netbios.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
