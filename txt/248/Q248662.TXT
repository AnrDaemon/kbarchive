======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you have Internet Information Server 4.0 installed on a Microsoft Windows
NT 4.0 Server-based computer, and you attempt to open the "Help on Internet
Information Server" file from the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), the Help
file may not open and you may receive the following error message in Internet
Explorer:

   The system cannot find the file specified.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when you use host headers with the Default Web Site. The
Default Web Site should use the Internet Protocol (IP) address of All Unassigned
and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 80 and should not use a host header
name.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, remove the host header from the Default Web Site.
