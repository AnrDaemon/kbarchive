SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to a computer running Internet Information Server 4.0 or
Internet Information Services 5.0, you may receive the following error message:

   HTTP Error 500-13 - Server too busy

   The request cannot be processed at this time. The amount of traffic exceeds
   the Web site's configured capacity.

CAUSE
=====

The server is unable to satisfy the request due to the internet traffic or
processor utilization the server is experiencing.

WORKAROUND
==========

Several steps can be taken to optimize server performance. Please see the list
of references in the "More Information" section for additional information.

You may want to consider multiple servers to service the volume of traffic and
use Windows Load Balancing to distribute the load.
