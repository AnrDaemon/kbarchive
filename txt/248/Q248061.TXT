SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to Internet Information Services (IIS) through a browser, you
may receive the following error message:

   HTTP 414 - Request - URI Too Long

CAUSE
=====

The server is refusing to service the request because the Request-URI is too
long. This rare condition is likely to occur in the following situations:

 - A client has improperly converted a POST request to a GET request with long
   query information.

 - A client has encountered a redirection problem (for example, a redirected URL
   prefix that points to a suffix of itself).

 - The server is under attack by a client attempting to exploit security holes
   present in some servers that use fixed-length buffers to read or manipulate
   the Request-URI.

IIS checks the string length of the URI and does not service a request when the
URI is longer than expected. This is by design.

Additional query words: IIS 5
