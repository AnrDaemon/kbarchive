TITLE   :XCLN: The Signature <Name.sig> Could Not Be Located
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2000,97,98
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you compose a new message in Outlook, you may encounter the following error
message:

   The signature "(name.sig)" could not be located. This signature may have been
   removed.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur for several reasons:

 - You have manually deleted the signature file or it is located on a network
   drive that is currently inaccessible.

 - You have edited the signature file using Word or Excel and have not quit the
   Office application.

 - You have uninstalled Outlook 2000 and attempted to use Outlook 97 or 98
   without rebooting and reinstalling the Outlook client.

WORKAROUND
==========

Workarounds for the possible causes are as follows:

 - Recreate the deleted signature file, and then retry creating a new message,
   or remap the network drive that is currently unavailable.

 - Quit the Office application that is locking the file open, and then compose a
   new message.

 - Reboot the computer and reinstall the Outlook client. Outlook 2000, 98, and
   97 use a different registry key location to specify where to store the
   signature file, so you may want to copy the .sig file to another location for
   later use.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
