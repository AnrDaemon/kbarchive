TITLE   :XCLN:Exchange Clients Get No Results Querying on Bcc Address
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 exc55sp1 exc55sp2 exc55sp3 kbExchange550preSP4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you use a Microsoft Exchange Client to query the information store on Bcc
address properties, the query does not yield any results. This is expected
behavior, unless you view items that are in the Sent Items folder on the
information store, or any other "pre-send" messages, such as drafts or messages
that are moved from the Sent Items folder to other folders. Exchange Server 5.5
does not provide results for a query if the query is based on the Bcc address
property.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior was originally implemented based on overly stringent security
decisions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
