TITLE   :SMS: Query for IP Address and Subnet Returns Unexpected Results
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,2.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 smsinst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Queries against discovery data in the Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0
database may return unexpected results or incorrect data.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the relationship between a given IP address and its
subnet is not stored in the discovery data portion of the database.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the resource is a client and hardware inventory has been collected, use the
Hardware Inventory classes to obtain this information because this relationship
is stored appropriately. For more information about writing queries for the SMS
database, see the Microsoft Systems Management Server 2.0 Software Developers
Kit, which is included with the Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit version 4.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You cannot obtain accurate results because the relationship between a given IP
address and its corresponding IP subnet is not explicitly stored in the
discovery tables in the database. When a computer has only one IP address, this
relationship is implied because there is only one subnet associated with the
resource. However, if a resource has multiple IP addresses and multiple IP
subnets, there is no association between a given IP address and a given subnet
that is stored in the database.

For example, if you build a query to return a list of computer names, IP
addresses, and IP subnets for all computer that are running Windows NT, the
result set includes multiple rows for those computers that have more than one IP
address. There is a row in the result set for each combination of IP addresses
and subnet addresses that is possible. A resource that has <n> adapters,
each on a different IP subnet, has <n>^2 rows in the result set.
Therefore, a resource with 3 IP addresses and subnets has 9 rows; a computer
with 100 IP addresses and 100 corresponding subnet addresses may have as many as
10,000 rows.
