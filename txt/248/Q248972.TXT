The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 
 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 Professional Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to optimize an installation of Microsoft Flight
Simulator 2000 without removing the program. You can do this by deleting some of
the stored (cached) files that are created when you install Flight Simulator
2000.

When you install Flight Simulator 2000, multiple files are created and cached in
the program for later use. It may be advantageous to delete certain of these
cached files. If you delete them, you may experience the following symptoms:

 - Any cached files that have become damaged are automatically recreated when
   you restart Flight Simulator 2000.

 - Some of the game settings may be returned to their default settings. This may
   cause some of the hardware installed in your computer to be redetected.

This article also resolves the issue when you receive the following error
message:

   Filelist.dat error file in list but not on remote <path\filename>
