The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to an Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 computer, you may
receive the following error message:

   HTTP 403.17 - Forbidden: Client certificate has expired or is not yet valid
   The page requires a valid client certificate

CAUSE
=====

The page you are trying to view requires the use of a valid client certificate.
Your client certificate has expired or is not yet valid. The client certificate
is used for identifying you as a valid user of the resource.

Generic 403 errors are returned when access to content has been forbidden. The
server is refusing to fulfill the request for content. This is generally not
related to NTFS permissions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this, do the following:

 - Check the Effective Date on the client certificate.

 - Ensure that the certificate is valid.

 - Check the Expiration Date on the client certificate.

 - Ensure that the certificate has not expired.

 - Verify that the Certificate Authority has not expired your certificate.

 - Request a new certificate from the Certificate Authority.
