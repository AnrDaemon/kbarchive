SUMMARY
=======

This article outlines the procedure to successfully install an Exchange Server
version 5.5 service pack on a computer running clustering services.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install an Exchange Server version 5.5 service pack on a computer running
clustering services:

1. Install the service pack on the primary (active) node by using the Update.exe
   program from the Exchange Server 5.5 service pack CD-ROM.

   IMPORTANT: Do not failover (move) the Exchange Server group to the secondary
   node.

2. Install the service pack on the secondary node by using the Update.exe
   program from the Exchange Server 5.5 service pack CD-ROM.

NOTE: If you update an earlier version of Exchange Server on clustered computers,
the installation program stops the Exchange Server services. When the update
installation is finished, the installation program restarts the services. This
causes an interruption for users, because they cannot connect to the server
during this time.
