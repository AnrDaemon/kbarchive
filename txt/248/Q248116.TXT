The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3 added the Session Class to Visual FoxPro. This
class allows you to create a private data session without the use of a form. The
benefit to this is that it allows you to create a lightweight (in terms of
resource usage) custom object with encapsulated data. You previously would have
needed a form, with all its associated overhead, or an empty formset to do
this.

One of the best places to use this is in multithreaded DLLs (also added in
Service Pack 3) since resource usage is at a premium in most cases where you
would be using them.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An example of how to use this new class follows.

   DEFINE CLASS myPrivateDSClass AS session

   PROCEDURE UseTable
       *!* By using the table inside a method of the session object,
       *!* you are working in the object's DataSession.
       LPARAMETER tcTable
          
       IF NOT USED(tcTable)
           USE (tcTable) IN 0
       ENDif
   ENDproc

   PROCEDURE Destroy
       CLOSE DATA ALL
   ENDproc

To see this class in action, save the above code into MyDS.prg, and then run the
following code:

   CREATE TABLE myDSTest (cTest C(10))
   USE DBF() SHARED
   *!* CREATE TABLE makes an exclusively-used table. USE DBF() SHARED is
   *!* a good method for not having to remember the path to the table.
   FOR i = 1 TO 10
      INSERT INTO myDSTest ;
         VALUES (TRANSFORM(i))
   ENDfor

   oDS = NEWOBJECT("myPrivateDSClass", "MyDS.prg")    
   *!* NEWOBJECT allows you to specify a class in a program or other 
   *!* location without the use of SET CLASSLIB TO ... ADDITIVE.
   oDS.UseTable("myDSTest")
   SET

   WAIT WINDOW "Suspending... RESUME to remove Session Object." NOWAIT
   *!* The following line is needed to keep oDS in scope, so you can
   *!* see the datasession.
   SUSPEND

SET opens the Data Session window. If you switch between the default data session
and MyPrivateDS, you see myDSTest open in both, with the record pointer at the
top of one and the bottom of the other.
