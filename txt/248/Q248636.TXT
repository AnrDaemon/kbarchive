TITLE   :Error When Executing a Query from ODBC Client in Windows NT 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are executing a query from an Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) client
running on Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Workstation, the following error message may
appear:

   The ODBC resource DLL (c:\windows\system32\odbcint.dll) is a different
   version than the ODBC driver manager (c:\windows\system\odbc32.dll)

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when there are two different versions of the Odbcint.dll
file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, check for duplicates of the file Odbcint.dll. If there
are two versions, keep the correct file (the one that is the same version as the
Odbc32.dll file) in the Winnt\System32 folder, and then rename the other file.
