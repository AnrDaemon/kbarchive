TITLE   :IPX Routing Does Not Succeed on a Windows NT 4.0 Network
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a multihomed Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0-based computer
as a router between subnets on a local area network (LAN) that is divided into
multiple physical subnets, routing by using the NWLink Internetwork Packet
Exchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange (IPX/SPX) compatible protocol on your network
may not succeed.

However, Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) routing works
correctly.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when each physical subnet does not have a unique
external network number.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, assign a unique external network number to each network
adapter on the multihomed Windows NT Server 4.0 router. (The NWLink protocol
uses these external network numbers to identify unique network segments.) On
each computer in the subnet, configure NWLink to use the correct external number
for its subnet.
