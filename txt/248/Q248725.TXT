TITLE   :XADM: Installing Exchange 5.5 on Windows 2000 May Not Work
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::2000,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5, on platform(s):
    - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to install Exchange Server 5.5 on a computer running Windows 2000
Server and the Exchange Server service account is not part of the Domain
Administrator group, the installation does not work. All of the registry entries
are present and the Exchsrvr folder is populated.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the Exchange Server service account does not have the
required permissions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, add the Exchange Server service account to the local
Power Users group or local Administrators group on a member server. On a domain
controller, add the account to the built-in Administrators group.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The minimum rights that are necessary for the Exchange Server service account on
a member server are Power Users rights. However, if installation problems occur
when you use the local Power Users group, add the Exchange Server service
account to the local Administrators group. Also, if the local Power Users group
is not available due to the type of installation that was performed, use the
local Administrators group.
