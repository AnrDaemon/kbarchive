KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a shared network installation (SETUP /N) of Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11, starting Remote Access Services (RAS) generates the
following error:

   Cannot load phone book or RAS manager data. Error 657: the device .INF file
   could not be opened.

CAUSE
=====

The above error message is generated when PAD.INF and SWITCH.INF are marked
read-only.

WORKAROUND
==========

You may be able to use RAS with a shared Windows for Workgroups installation if
only one person on the network attempts to use RAS and you remove the read-only
attribute from PAD.INF and SWITCH.INF. (If the shared directory is located on a
server, full permissions must also be granted.)


STATUS
======

RAS was not designed to run under a shared Windows for Workgroups installation.
This functionality was not tested by Microsoft and is not supported.

Additional query words: 3.11 file attribute set
