SUMMARY
=======

The ADDNAME utility that ships with LAN Manager TCP/IP allows you to enter LAN
Manager NetBIOS names and their IP addresses into the TCP/IP name cache without
modifying the LMHOSTS file. The same functionality is available in Windows NT by
the NBTSTAT utility.

To add a new NetBIOS name IP address in Windows NT, do the following:

1. Edit the file <winnt root>\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC\LMHOSTS.

2. Add the new IP address and NetBIOS name.

3. Put #PRE at the end of the line if you want the address to be cached into
   memory. Otherwise, Windows NT will search the LMHOSTS file if the name is not
   found in the cache which could take longer.

4. Run NBTSTAT -R.

The -R parameter rereads the LMHOSTS file and adds #PRE lines into the name
cache.
