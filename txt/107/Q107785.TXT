SYMPTOMS

When you print to a fax machine, you may receive a GP fault or an Invalid Page
Fault (IPF), Word may hang (stop responding), or you may receive an error

This problem occurs when you are using a fax driver and you have background
printing turned on. When background printing is turned on, the fax driver cannot
display informational dialog boxes correctly; therefore, Word is unable to print
your document.

To resolve this problem, turn off background printing. To turn off background
printing, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. Click the Print Tab.
