SUMMARY
=======

The following list describes the information displayed in the status line of the
5250 Applet.

CONNECTION INDICATOR
--------------------

The session is in the indicated state: connected or disconnected. When menu items
are highlighted, an explanation of the menu item is displayed.

STATUS INDICATORS
-----------------

These indicators are only true when red.

SA (System Available):

The AS/400 is operating and is available to the PC.

MW (Message Waiting):

The AS/400 has one or more messages for you.

KS (Keyboard Shift):

The keyboard is in shifted mode.

IM (Insert Mode):

Characters inserted into an existing field will not type over the existing data.

II (Input Inhibited):

Keyboard input is not being accepted by the AS/400. Try pressing ERROR RESET. If
it is still highlighted, the system is processing your request.

KB (Keystroke Buffering):

Keystrokes are being saved in a temporary buffer (storage space), because
keyboard input is not being accepted by the AS/400 (as indicated by the II
indicator). After the II indicator goes off, the keystrokes will be processed.
To clear the keystroke buffering, press ERROR RESET.

----------------------------

These indicators appear only when the applet is connected to the AS/400. The
following are examples of system and device indicators:
