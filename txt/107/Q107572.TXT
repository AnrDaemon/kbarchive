-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to run an MS-DOS-based application in an MS-DOS virtual machine (VM),
the program may not start, or you may receive the following error message:

   Error 2138: The workstation service has not been started.

CAUSE
=====

This error can be caused by running an application that calls the
DosMakeMailslot function after you have started the real-mode redirector.

RESOLUTION
==========

Rather than using the real-mode redirector, use the protected-mode redirector
(virtual redirector).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error message is misleading since you have started the workstation
services.

When running the real-mode redirector, mailslots are not supported in virtual
machines.
