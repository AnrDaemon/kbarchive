======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are running Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with MSIPX, you may experience a
five-second delay when you start applications from the Windows graphical user
interface (GUI). This delay occurs only if you have 32-bit file access enabled
on a hard disk drive controlled by the real mode mapper (RMM.D32). In this
situation, Windows may also load more slowly. This delay does not occur when you
start MS-DOS applications from an MS-DOS virtual machine (VM).

Real mode mapper controlled drives include drives that are incompatible with
32-bit disk access and drives that have been compressed with a disk- compression
program, such as MS-DOS 6.2 DoubleSpace or STAC Electronics' Stacker. (MS-DOS
6.0 DoubleSpace is incompatible with 32-bit file access).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Upgrade MSIPX to Novell ODI drivers. This is recommended for Windows for
   Workgroups 3.11/Novell NetWare users. ODI should provide faster access to
   NetWare servers and improve Windows for Workgroups performance.

   -or-

 - Disable 32-bit file access.
