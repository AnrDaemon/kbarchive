-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

PROFS users sometimes find duplicates in their inboxes of mail messages that
originate from a Microsoft Mail for PC Networks user and are transferred through
Microsoft Mail Gateway to PROFS.

CAUSE
=====

As part of its message processing, the PROFS Gateway creates temporary files
that contain a copy of the original mail message and attachments. If the Gateway
crashes while PROFS is processing a mail message, PROFS uses a temporary file to
re-process the message when operations resume.

If the original message is properly delivered but the Gateway crashes or halts
before the temporary files are deleted, PROFS still re-processes and re-delivers
the message when operations resume, causing a duplicate.

WORKAROUND
==========

This is a normal Gateway safeguard against lost mail. Delete the duplicate
message.
