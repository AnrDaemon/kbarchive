TITLE   :PC Win: Custom Message Class Not Maintained Through Gateway
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you read a custom message that was sent via a gateway in version 3.0, 3.0b,
or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the custom message class may not be
preserved and the message will display in standard note form. This problem can
occur when a message of a custom message class is sent through a
nonencapsulating gateway.

CAUSE
=====

Custom message classes that are defined without a text map are not preserved
when they are sent through nonencapsulating gateways. The message will arrive
with the custom message type incorrectly reset to:

   IPM.Microsoft Mail.Note

This problem can occur when mail is sent in one of the following scenarios:

1. A custom message type is sent from a user running on one type of mail system
   through a nonencapsulating gateway to a user on a different type of mail
   system (for example, Mail for PC Networks to MCI Mail).

2. A custom message type is sent from a user on a specific mail system to a user
   on the same kind of mail system through a foreign mail system whose gateways
   do not support encapsulation (for example, Mail for PC Networks through MCI
   Mail to Mail for PC Networks).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows. This problem was corrected in MSSFS.DLL, version
3.2.0.4079. If you do not have version 3.2.0.4079 (or later), you can download
