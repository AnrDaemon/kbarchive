TITLE   :INFO: BROWSE IN SCREEN Uses Active Window
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:2.0,2.5,2.5a,2.5b; WINDOWS:2.5,2.5a,2.5b,3.0,5.0,6.0

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The FoxPro 2.5 for MS-DOS and Windows "Language Reference" (page L3-250), the
FoxPro 2.0 for MS-DOS "Commands & Functions" manual, and the Visual FoxPro
online Help incorrectlystate that the BROWSE IN SCREEN command places a Browse
window on the desktop in FoxPro for MS-DOS or in the main window in FoxPro for
Windows, even if a user-defined window is active.

Instead, to place a Browse window in the default size and location, you must also
issue the NORMAL clause.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

The following series of commands illustrates this behavior:

   USE <filename>
   DEFINE WINDOW test FROM 1,1 TO 20,20
   ACTIVATE WINDOW test
   @1,1 SAY "hello" && test is the current output window
   BROWSE IN SCREEN

Note that the Browse information is displayed in the window "test".

To correct this problem, issue the following series of commands:

   USE <filename>
   DEFINE WINDOW test FROM 1,1 TO 20,20
   ACTIVATE WINDOW test
   @1,1 SAY "hello" && test is the current output window
   BROWSE IN SCREEN NORMAL
