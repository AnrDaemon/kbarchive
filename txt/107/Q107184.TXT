SUMMARY
=======

Flight Simulator version 5.0 supports scenery files created with Aircraft &
Scenery Designer (ASD) for use with Flight Simulator version 4.0. The files must
be used in conjunction with the Flight Simulator 4.0 ASD database.

MORE INFORMATION
================


To use Flight Simulator 4.0 Aircraft & Scenery Designer files with Flight
Simulator 5.0, proceed as follows.

NOTE: The following assumes the Flight Simulator program is installed on your
hard drive on drive C and that the directory is FLTSIM5.

1. Copy the Flight Simulator 4.0 database (the file named F1 in the FS4
   directory) and the desired scenery files (with the extension .SC1) to the
   Flight Simulator 5.0 scenery directory (C:\FLTSIM5\SCENERY by default).

2. Run Flight Simulator and click Scenery Library from the Scenery menu. The F1
   database is displayed in the Choose A Scenery Area list as Old FS4 World
   Scenery.

3. Click Old FS4 World Scenery, then click Select SC1 File to display the list
   of ASD scenery files. Select the one you desire.

4. If you want Flight Simulator to load the appropriate scenery files
   automatically based on the aircraft position, then from the Selection option,
   click Automatic By A&SD Scenery Bounds.
