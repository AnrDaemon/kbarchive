SYMPTOMS
========

You may not be able to play animations in Encarta if you are using an ATI Mach
32 or Mach 8 video card. This problem occurs if the Device Bitmaps option is set
to On (it is on by default).

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Encarta, 1994 edition. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

NOTE: This problem has been found to occur with builds 1.5(59) and 2.0 of the ATI
Mach 32 and Mach 8 video drivers. This problem has not been reproduced in
Windows 95.

For more information on ATI Mach video cards and drivers, contact the technical
support department of ATI Technologies Inc. at (905) 882-2626.

RESOLUTION
==========

To eliminate this problem, turn off the Device Bitmaps setting. To do this,
follow these steps:

1. Start the Mach FlexDesk Control Panel.

   NOTE: The icon for this control panel is usually located in the Mach Utilities
   program group in Program Manager. If you can't find the icon, you can create
   a new one, or launch the utility using the Run option in the Program Manager
   File menu. The filename of the utility is MXXPANEL.EXE, and it is located in
   the Windows directory.

2. Choose Advanced.

3. Set Device Bitmaps to Off.

4. Choose OK to close the Advanced Settings dialog box.

5. Choose OK to close the FlexDesk Control Panel.

6. Restart Windows to make the changes take effect.

You should now be able to run Encarta animations successfully.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you are installing Encarta, if Setup detects an ATI Mach 8 or Mach 32 card,
the following message appears:

   Setup has detected your ATI Mach Video card. After Setup is complete, please
   refer to the README.WRI file for important information on using this card
   with Encarta.

README.WRI contains the information covered in this article.
