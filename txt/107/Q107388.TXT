The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator for MS-DOS, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Select SC1 File button in the Scenery, Scenery Library menu will not be
visible if the system is not configured to use at least 80K of expanded memory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Expanded memory is required to take advantage of most scenery options in Flight
Simulator 5.0 and to import files from Aircraft and Scenery Designer (Flight
Simulator 4.0) for use with Flight Simulator version 5.0. The memory must be
configured for at least 80K of expanded memory (EMS) or some options may not be
available.

For more information about how to configure the RAM memory as expanded memory,
consult the inside back cover of the Microsoft Flight Simulator Pilot's Handbook
or your MS-DOS or Windows manual.
