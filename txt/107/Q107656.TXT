TITLE   :Writer: GP Fault After a Random Animation Plays
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Kids Products

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
 - Microsoft Fine Artist for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using the Dell VGA 800 x 600 32,000-color video driver, you may
receive a general protection (GP) fault when Creative Writer plays a random
animation.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Creative Writer versions 1.0, 1.1
and 1.1a. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.


RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, use a different video driver supported by your card, such
as the Dell 800 x 600 256-color (512K) driver, or use a standard VGA driver. The
problem has not been found to occur with any other video driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. On a system using the Dell VGA 800 x 600 32,000-color video driver, start
   Creative Writer.

2. Go to the lobby of Imaginopolis.

3. Wait until a random animation plays.

After the animation finishes playing, you may receive the GP fault error. This
problem does not occur with all animations. For example, it has been found to
occur with the swimming squid and the jumping pig, but not with Max skating
across the screen.
