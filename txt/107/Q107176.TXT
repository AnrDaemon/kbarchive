SUMMARY
=======

The Statue of Liberty in Flight Simulator is a two-dimensional image that
appears to be propped up with stick.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The image for the Statue of Liberty was taken directly from Flight Simulator
version 4.0 in which the image also appeared two-dimensional. However, in
version 5.0 a brown line that looks very much like a stick stretches from the
base of the statue to the middle of the back. However, the New York scenery
add-on corrects this problem, making the statue three dimensional.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Flight Simulator for MS-DOS,
version 5.0.
