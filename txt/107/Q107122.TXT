The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If an invalid XID or an XID already in use is detected by the host when a
dial-up (switched) SDLC connection is being established, the following error
will be recorded in the Event Log under Application. The Event Detail will
report the source SNA IBM SDLC Link. The description might read like this:

   Event: 182
   Connection failure, code=11
   Cause Data = 3601 3401 3302 f035
   Link Role = 00
   Remote Node Type = 00

CAUSE
=====

Cause data is a list of the failure causes from the Failure subvector in the
alert. Link role and remote node type are as described in the Link Connections
Subsystem Configuration Data subvector in the alert. A connection failure can be
due to a station outage, rather than a link outage. If it is due to a station
outage--which can be recognized by outage code values of X'80' or higher--then
message #183 will also be logged.

If this occurs and there are no other configuration issues that could be causing
the link service to fail, this is more than likely the cause of the failure.

The SNA Server Reference Guide (Connection failure, code=11) corresponds to "Data
Set Ready (DSR) failure". This occurs when the host drops the link when the
Local Node ID (XID) sent by SNA Server is not recognized or not is use.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the XID to a known XID, or an XID that is confirmed not to be in use. You
can do this by doing the following:

1. From SNA Server Admin, select the link service you want to change.

2. Choose Services, and then choose Properties.

3. In the Connection Properties dialog box, choose Setup.

4. Change the Local Node ID by choosing the OK button, and then choosing the OK
   button again.

5. Save this configuration, and then restart SNA Server.
