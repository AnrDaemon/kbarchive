The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After converting several Stacker-compressed drives to DoubleSpace- compressed
drives, your drive letter assignments may be incorrect. For example, the drive
letters for a removable media drive and its host drive may be reversed.

CAUSE

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use the DBLSPACE /HOST command to set the correct
drive letters for your drives.

For more information on using the DBLSPACE /HOST command, type "help dblspace
/host" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press
ENTER.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS Conversion Disk for Users
of Stacker. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
