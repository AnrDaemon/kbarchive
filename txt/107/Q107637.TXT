The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start a 3270 or 5250 session from a Windows NT RAS client
(or from a Windows NT computer which was rebooted without being initially
connected to a network), the emulator does not start and the following error
occurs:

   ERROR - The SnaBase service is not started.

Also, once SnaBase is started, the Windows NT user must still be authorized to
open a network session to the Windows NT server where SNA Server is running, or
the SNA session cannot connect. If this occurs, the 3270 applet displays "No SNA
Server found in domain", while the 5250 applet displays error F004
(Comm_Subsystem_Not_Loaded).

CAUSE
=====

When Windows NT starts up, the SnaBase service is configured to autostart.
However, if SnaBase cannot initially connect to an SNA Server, SnaBase stops
before the user can establish the RAS connection.

If an administrator logs into the computer and the 3270 emulator is started, the
SnaBase service is autostarted. However, if a user logs into the computer, the
user does not have authority to start a Windows NT service (for example, SnaBase
service), so this error occurs.

Also, once SnaBase is started, the user must still have authority to open a
network session to the Windows NT computer where SNA Server is running. If a
user account exists on the Windows NT computer, the local user password must
match the Windows NT domain user password or access is denied.

RESOLUTION
==========

An SNA Server 2.11 update is available to correct this problem. Microsoft has
updated the following Windows NT client files to correct this problem:

   <snaroot>\SYSTEM\SNABASE.EXE
   <snaroot>\SYSTEM\SNADMOD.DLL

With this update applied, SnaBase does not terminate if you add the following
registry Value under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree under the following subkey:

   /SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/SnaBase/  Parameters/ 

   Value Name: TerminateIfNoSponsors
   Data Type:  REG_DWORD
   Data: 0

If this entry is not present, or is set to 1, then SnaBase terminates if it
cannot open the sponsor connection.

NOTE: This update is included in SNA Server versions 2.11 SP1 and later.

Without applying this update, it is possible to work around this problem by
assigning the following rights to local users so that they have authority to
start SnaBase:

 - For Windows NT Workstation, the local user must be a member of the "Power
   Users" group.

 - For Windows NT Servers, the local user must be a member of the "Server
   Operators" group.

Also, once the SnaBase service is started, the Windows NT user must still have
authority to open a network session to the Windows NT computer where the SNA
Server is running. When connecting over RAS, a Windows NT user must initially
login to the computer using a local user account. When attempting to get a
session to the SNA Server, the local user credentials are used to connect to the
Windows NT computer where SNA Server is running.

If the user passwords are not synchronized, and if the SNA client is connecting
to the server over named pipes, the user can still gain access to the SNA Server
by preestablishing a network session to the server before starting their SNA
application. To do this, the user can issue the following command:

   " net use \\<server_name>\ipc$ /user:<domain>\<user_name>
   *" (without the quotation marks)

where <server_name> is the SNA Server, <domain> is the Windows NT
domain, <user_name> is the Windows NT user name, and * causes the prompt
for the user's Windows NT password.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
