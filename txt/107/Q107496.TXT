CAUSE
=====

Lack of available disk space for the generation of various intermediate,
listing, and object files by the compiler causes the above error.

RESOLUTION

Check for the available disk space when starting the compilation process; it
should be large enough for all the intermediate, listing, and object files to be
generated by the compiler.
