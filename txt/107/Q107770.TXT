SUMMARY
=======

If you are running the Novell NetWare Requester for OS/2 2.01 (for IBM OS/2 2.0
and 2.1) without NetWare 4.0 on the network, you should perform the following
two actions:

1. Disable directory services by adding or editing the following line in the
   NET.CFG file:

   NetWare Requester
   Directory Services OFF

   NetWare Requester for OS/2 2.01 has Directory Services enabled by default
   because the Requestor was designed to run in a NetWare 4.0 environment.

   If Directory Services are not disabled, logging in to a NetWare server may be
   slow and the following error may be returned when you try to attach to other
   servers:

   REQ1040: The requester timed out waiting for reply from server

2. Copy the NetWare 3.11 OS/2 Login Utilities (contained in UT2OS2.EXE found on
   NetWire, NOVLIB 6) into the directory where the NetWare Requester 2.01 is
   installed.

   When the NetWare Requester 2.01 is installed, the NetWare 4.0 OS/2 LOGIN
   utilities are installed in the same directory as the Requester. In a
   non-NetWare 4.0 environment, you must replace these NetWare 4.0 OS/2
   utilities with NetWare 3.11 OS/2 Utilities.

   LOGIN Utilities:

   NetWare 4.00 OS/2              NetWare 3.11 OS/2
