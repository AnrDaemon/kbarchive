TITLE   :MS-DOS 6.2 Stacker Conversion Err Msg: Out of Memory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you start the Stacker conversion process and DoubleSpace reboots your
computer, you may receive the following error message:

   AN ERROR OCCURRED while attempting to convert Stacker volume c:\stacvol.dsk
   to DoubleSpace format. There is not enough conventional memory.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when DoubleSpace reboots your computer and there is
insufficient memory to convert your Stacker volume file (SVF) to a DoubleSpace
compressed volume file (CVF) due to the size of your SVF.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can work around this problem by using the following procedure:

NOTE: Reboot your computer and try to run the Stacker conversion routine after
each step.

1. Place DBLSPACE.SYS in a parallel directory on the host drive. For example, if
   C:\DOS contains your MS-DOS files, and your host drive is D, type "xcopy
   c:\dos\dblspace.sys d:\dos\" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS
   command prompt and then press ENTER.

2. Edit the CONFIG.SYS file and ensure the DEVICE commands for HIMEM.SYS and, if
   present, EMM386.EXE are placed before the first DEVICE=C:\DOS\DBLSPACE.SYS
   line.

3. Edit the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files and remark out unneeded device
   drivers and terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs using the REM command.

4. Defragment the host drive for the Stacker-compressed drive. To do this:

   a. Copy ATTRIB.EXE to the host drive.

   b. Copy DEFRAG.EXE to the host drive.

   c. Unmount the Stacker-compressed drive.

   d. Clear the file attributes on the SVF. For example, type "attrib -r -s -h
      stacvol.*" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and
      then press ENTER.

   e. Run DEFRAG /H <host drive> to fully defragment the Stacker host
      drive.
