-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 requires at least 400K of conventional memory on
the Gateway machine after all drivers are loaded.

The amount of conventional memory available on the Gateway machine determines how
many recipients and attachments are supported in a message.

Configure the Gateway machine for the maximum free conventional memory. To
determine the largest executable program size that can be run, use the Microsoft
MS-DOS MEM command.

For additional information about maximizing conventional memory, consult your
MS-DOS and network operating system documentation.
