The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Multimedia Viewer Publishing Toolkit, versions 2.0, 2.0a

To change the default tab stops used by Viewer or Windows Help, the
new tab stop positions must be explicitly set in Word for Windows.
Word's default tab stops are not supported by Viewer.

Word for Windows uses the RTF token \deftabN to save its default tab
stops, where N is the size of the default tabs. Viewer doesn't support
this RTF token, and when it sees tabs within the RTF file, Viewer it
uses its own default tab stops, which are at .5 inches.

If tab stop positions are explicitly set in Word, Word will write \txN
tokens to the RTF file, where N is the position of the tab stop.
Viewer does support the \tx token, and therefore the tabs will show up
correctly in the Viewer title.
