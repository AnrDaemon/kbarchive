The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Multimedia Viewer Publishing Toolkit, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 9-43 of the Microsoft Multimedia Viewer version 2.0 "Technical
Reference" incorrectly documents the lParam1 that can be used with the
GI_BOTADDR flag for VwrGetInfo(). The documentation says "you can
specify NULL to obtain the bottom address in the scrolling region of
the topmost window." In fact, if NULL is specified for lParam1,
VwrGetInfo always returns -1. lParam1 must specify the window handle
of a Viewer topic region.

Additional query words: 2.00
