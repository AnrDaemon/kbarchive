The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 321 of the Microsoft Windows NT System Guide states the following:

   "At the command prompt, you can change the library path for OS/2
   applications by using the "Os2libpath" command."

This is a documentation error. The "Os2libpath" command must be used with
the "Set" command in order change the environment variable settings. Using
the "Set" command in an MS-DOS VDM only changes the variable in that
particular MS-DOS VDM.

To "permanently" change the "Os2libpath" variable, use the Set command
dialog button in the System icon of Control Panel. Even using this, it will
only append the change to the default system "Os2libpath" which is
%SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\OS2\DLL. The default System path itself cannot be
changed.
