SUMMARY
=======

When troubleshooting with Microsoft Mail Gateway to PROFS and OfficeVision you
can halt the virtual machine (which makes up the host components) and examine it
for unprocessed reader files that may hold a clue to the problem. Here is how to
use the PEEK command to examine these files for format integrity:

1. List the reader by typing:

   " Q RDR ALL" (without the quotation marks)

   This lists the items in the reader and the associated file number given each
   file and print job routed through the VM.

2. Use the file number and the PEEK command to view the file:

   PEEK file ###
