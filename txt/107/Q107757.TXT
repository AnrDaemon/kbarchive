TITLE   :PC MAPI: MapiSaveMail Is Inconsistent When Passed NULL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Messaging Application Program Interface (MAPI) from versions 3.0, 3.0b and
3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, the MapiSaveMail function is not
consistent when passed the NULL value.

If a message in the inbox contains subject and text, you can use MapiFindNext to
retrieve the message ID value. You can use MapiSaveMail to change the subject
and text, but if you change both to NULL, only the text actually changes; the
subject does not.

   MapiMessage[0].pszSubject=/NULL
   MapiMessage[0].pszNoteText=/NULL

The date also does not change when passed the NULL value.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MAPI from versions 3.0, 3.0b,
and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
