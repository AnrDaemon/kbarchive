 - Microsoft Scenes (all collections), version 1.0

SUMMARY
=======

You can retain existing wallpaper after you run Microsoft Scenes; however, you
must create a picture set containing the specific wallpaper bitmap and set up
Microsoft Scenes to use the picture in the newly created picture set.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The existing wallpaper is replaced by the new wallpaper selected in Microsoft
Scenes when you start Microsoft Scenes.

To use the preexisting wallpaper as your wallpaper after starting Scenes, do the
following:

1. Copy the bitmap file you are using for wallpaper into its own directory.

2. Start Microsoft Scenes and click the Scenes Wizards button to add a picture
   set.

3. Follow the directions in Scenes Wizards to add a picture set, and direct
   Scenes Wizards to the folder of the wallpaper bitmap.

4. When you are finished adding a picture set in Scenes Wizards, click the Keep
   Current Picture option button in the Wallpaper section.

5. Click the Choose Wallpaper button and click the newly created picture set.
   Click the picture of the wallpaper and click OK.
