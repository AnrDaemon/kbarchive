OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Windows for Workgroups 3.11 for the first time after installing it
on a machine that was previously configured to use IBM LAN Server networking
functionality, you may receive the following message:

   The protocol manager could not be opened.
   The return code is 3.
   Error in loading - Press F1 to continue.
   Can not find Protocol Manager

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs if any of the following IBM LAN Server components remain in
the startup files after you install Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and select
Microsoft Windows Network peer-to-peer networking functionality:

   CONFIG.SYS
   ----------

   DEVICE=C:\LSP\DXMA0MOD.SYS XXX
   DEVICE=C:\LSP\DXMJ0MOD.SYS

   AUTOEXEC.BAT
   ------------

   C:\LSP\NETBIND

RESOLUTION
==========

If you find the above items in the startup files after installing Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 and selecting Microsoft Windows Network peer-to-peer networking
functionality, remove them with an ASCII text editor, such as Microsoft Windows
Notepad.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11, you can choose to
install Microsoft Windows Network peer-to-peer networking functionality or
Windows client networking functionality for another network (such as IBM LAN
Server). If you decide to install the Microsoft Windows Network, any recognized
components of other networks found in the startup files are replaced with the
equivalent Windows for Workgroups drivers. However, some components, such as the
IBM LAN Server components listed above, may not be recognized by Setup and
therefore must be manually removed.
