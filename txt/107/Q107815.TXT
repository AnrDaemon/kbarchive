TITLE   :NET START FULL Invokes Intel SatisFAXtion Fax Popup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the SatisFAXtion Fax Popup utility (FAXPOP) is loaded in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file, the NET START FULL command invokes that utility. Pressing the ESC key to
cancel it returns you to the MS-DOS command prompt. The NET START FULL command
then proceeds to run.

CAUSE
=====

The SatisFAXtion Fax Popup utility is a terminate-and-stay-resident program that
allows you to send faxes from any MS-DOS-based application (such as MS- DOS
Editor or MS-DOS Shell). When NET START FULL is run, FAXPOP traps it and
executes its own fax-sending utility.

WORKAROUND
==========

At this time, the only way to work around this problem is to remove FAXPOP from
your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

NOTE: Changing IRQs or I/O addresses does not correct this problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================
