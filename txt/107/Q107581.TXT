-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not been
tested and are not supported by Microsoft.

If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.

SUMMARY
=======

If you install Windows for Workgroups 3.11 using the SETUP /N command on a
workstation without a hard disk (a "diskless" workstation), and you then run a
NET USE command in a Windows for Workgroups virtual machine (VM), all Novell
NetWare drive mappings, all Windows for Workgroups drive connections, and all
Windows for Workgroups printer connections are displayed (in that order).

MORE INFORMATION
================

On a computer with a hard disk drive and a SETUP /N configuration (or a local
installation of Windows for Workgroups with Novell NetWare), a NET USE command
in a Windows for Workgroups VM displays only the existing Windows for Workgroups
drive and printer connections.

However, all network connections (both NetWare mappings and Windows for
Workgroups connections) are displayed in a Windows for Workgroups VM if the
following conditions are true:

 - You have a SETUP /N configuration on a diskless NetWare workstation as a
   second network under Windows for Workgroups.

 - All startup files are on a boot disk image.

 - All startup files are on the network.

 - The Windows directory is located on the network.

 - All Windows files are on the network.

 - All above directories and files must be in the NetWare search paths.
