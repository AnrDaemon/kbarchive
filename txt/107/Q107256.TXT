======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Section 4 of the Conversion Disk for Users of Stacker CONVERT.TXT file covers
the following scenario:

   DoubleSpace Could Not Convert a Stacker Drive Because There Was Not Enough
   Free Space

Although the CONVERT.TXT file recommends removing unnecessary files to create
more free space, you may be able to work around this situation by using SDEFRAG
to defragment the Stacker-compressed drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To defragment the Stacker-compressed drive, type "SDEFRAG" (without the
quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER. If you are
still unable to covert the Stacker-compressed drive to a DoubleSpace-compressed
drive because of a lack of free space, after you defragment the
Stacker-compressed drive, follow the procedure in section 4 of the CONVERT.TXT
file.

Section 4 of the CONVERT.TXT file
---------------------------------

DoubleSpace Could Not Convert a Stacker Drive Because
   There Was Not Enough Free Space:

DoubleSpace indicates how much free space needs to be free on your startup or
uncompressed drive. Make a note of this amount. Then carry out the following
procedure:

1. Type the following at the command prompt:

   " chkdsk drive:" (without the quotation marks)

   For the drive: parameter, type the drive letter of your uncompressed drive
   followed by a colon (:). A line similar to the following should appear on
   your screen:

   20386 bytes available on disk

2. Delete unnecessary files or move files to another drive until you have enough
   free disk space. You might want to back up the files before you delete them.

   IMPORTANT: Do not delete your COMMAND.COM, AUTOEXEC.BAT, or CONFIG.SYS files,
   your hidden Stacker or system files, or the STACKER.COM and SSWAP.COM files
   in your Stacker directory. If you cannot delete enough unnecessary files, use
   the SDEFRAG /G command to make more uncompressed space available, or contact
   your disk-compression software vendor.

3. Run DoubleSpace again.
