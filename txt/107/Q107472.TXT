SUMMARY
=======

With CAS fax modems, the fax monitor feature of Microsoft At Work PC Fax stays
in an idle state while receiving faxes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

CAS-compatible fax modems have their own processors and memory and are designed
to work independently in the background. Commands to CAS fax modems are issued
to CASMGR.EXE or CASMODEM.EXE, depending on the modem and revision of the CAS
modems. This program then issues the appropriate commands to the CAS modem.

When a CAS modem receives a fax, it does so in the background, independently of
At Work PC Fax. CASMGR does not notify At Work PC Fax that a fax is arriving.
After the fax arrives, CASMGR places the fax in a queue. At Work PC Fax checks
the queue periodically for new faxes. Because this occurs in the background, At
Work PC Fax cannot monitor the progress of an incoming fax.

At Work PC Fax does monitor sent message rendering status. During a fax send, fax
monitor reports the progress of the fax-rendering process.
