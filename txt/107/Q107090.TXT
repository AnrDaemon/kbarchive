SUMMARY
=======

The host access component of Microsoft Mail Gateway to PROFS and OfficeVision
uses two custom Gateway EXIT executables to set To and From addresses on
messages between the host and the MS mail systems.

Use this query to verify that the EXITs are properly installed and enabled:

   SM MSRSCS Q SYS EXIT

If all is well, the system responds:

   EXIT 2 enabled
   EXIT 15 enabled

If you have problems with the EXITs, do this:

1. Make sure the EXITs are being turned on in the MSRSCS machine's RSCS CONFIG
   file. Look for these two lines:

   EXIT 2 ON CSIEXIT2
   EXIT 15 ON CSIEXITF

2. Make sure your RSCS system has the correct EXITs installed. Use COMPARE to
   match the CSIEXIT LOADLIB installed on the MSRSCS's 191 disk against the
   CSIEXIT2 and CSIEXIT3 LOADLIBs on the 193 disk. If you find discrepancies,
   copy the EXITs from the VMID's 193 disk. If you think an EXIT is corrupt,
   upload an original version from the installation diskettes.
