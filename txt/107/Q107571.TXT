======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
 - Microsoft SNA Workstation for Windows NT, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

While Windows NT or Windows NT Advanced Server supports Windows 3.x, MS- DOS,
and character-based OS/2 applications, SNA Application Programming Interface
(API) support on Windows NT varies depending on the SNA Server version being
used.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SNA Server Version 2.0
----------------------

The SNA Server version 2.x CD-ROM includes SNA client software for Windows NT,
Windows 3.x, MS-DOS, and OS/2 clients. However, only 32-bit Windows SNA
applications are designed to work with the SNA Server Windows NT client
software. Any SNA application designed to run on these other client platforms
are only supported on their native platform type. To summarize:

 - Windows 3.x., MS-DOS or OS/2-based SNA applications are not supported on the
   SNA Server Windows NT client.

 - Windows 3.x SNA applications are not supported with the SNA Server Windows
   3.x client software when run on a Windows NT machine.

 - OS/2 SNA applications are not supported with the SNA Server OS/2 client
   software when run from a Windows NT machine.

 - MS-DOS SNA applications are not supported with the SNA Server MS-DOS client
   software when run from a Windows NT machine.

NOTE: SNA Workstation 2.0, the standalone Windows NT version of SNA Server 2.0,
includes Win32 SNA API support for all APIs (APPC, CPIC, LUA, CSV, and 3270
EIS), though no SNA API support for Win16, MS-DOS or OS/2.

SNA Server Version 2.1
----------------------

The SNA Server version 2.x CD-ROM includes SNA client software for Windows NT,
Windows 3.x, MS-DOS, and OS/2 clients.. Under Windows NT, you can install either
the SNA Server Windows NT client or the SNA Server Windows 3.x client, but not
both. Only 32-bit Windows SNA applications are designed to work with the SNA
Server Windows NT client software. Any SNA application designed to run on other
client platforms are supported only on their native platform type. To
summarize:

 - Windows 3.x, MS-DOS, and OS/2-based SNA applications are not supported on the
   SNA Server Windows NT client.

 - Windows 3.x SNA applications are supported with the SNA Server Windows 3.x
   client software when run on a computer running Windows NT.

 - OS/2 SNA applications are not supported with the SNA Server OS/2 client
   software when run from a computer running Windows NT.

 - MS-DOS SNA applications are not supported with the SNA Server MS-DOS client
   software when run from a computer running Windows NT.

NOTE: SNA Workstation 2.0, the standalone Windows NT version of SNA Server 2.0,
includes Win32 SNA API support for all APIs (APPC, CPIC, LUA, CSV, and 3270
EIS), though no SNA API support for Win16, MS-DOS or OS/2.

SNA Server Version 2.11
-----------------------

SNA Server 2.11 supports "thunking" of many of the Windows 3.x SNA APIs on the
SNA Server Windows NT client software. This applies to APPC, CPIC, CSV, LUA, and
EHNAPPC interfaces. This will allow many Windows 3.x SNA applications to run on
the SNA Server Windows NT client software. However, the SNA Server Windows 3.x
Emulator Interface Specification (or "EIS", used by many 3270 emulation
products) is not supported on the SNA Server 2.11 Windows NT client software.
For more information about the 3270 EIS interface, see the SNA Server 3270
Emulator Interface Specification included in softcopy form on the SNA Server
CD-ROM.

NOTE: To support the Win16 SNA APIs on the SNA Server Win32 SNA client software,
the special thunking versions of the Win16 client DLLs must be manually
installed into the <SNAROOT>\SYSTEM directory. These DLLs can be found on
the SNA Server 2.11 compact disc in the \CLIENTS\WINNT\I386\SYSTEM\THUNK
directory.

NOTE: SNA Workstation 2.11, the standalone Windows NT version of SNA Server 2.11,
includes Win32 SNA API support for all APIs (APPC, CPIC, LUA, CSV and 3270 EIS),
as well as Win16 SNA API support for APPC, CPIC, LUA, and CSV (but not 3270 EIS)
by applying the thunk version of the DLL's as described above.

SNA Server Versions 3.0 and 4.0
-------------------------------

The SNA Server version 3.0 and 4.0 CD-ROM includes client software for Windows
NT, Windows 3.x, MS-DOS and OS/2 clients. The SNA Server 3.0 and 4.0 Windows NT
client software support is unchanged from 2.11, where the Win32 SNA APIs are
supported, as well as most of the Win16 SNA APIs are supported (by applying the
thunk DLLs).

NOTE: SNA Workstation Version 3.0 and 4.0 support is the same as SNA Workstation
Version 2.11 in this area.

Microsoft is interested in customer requests for such cross-platform SNA
application support on Windows NT. Please let us know the specific SNA
application (and platform it was written for) so that we can consider this in a
future release.
