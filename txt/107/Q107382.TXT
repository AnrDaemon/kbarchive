TITLE   :SNA Server Application Exception
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

An application exception occurs in SNA Server and a Dr. Watson log is generated.
The log shows that exception C0000005 has occurred in module SNASERVR. This only
happens when the Attachmate Extra print emulator communicates with SNA Server.


CAUSE
=====

This error is observed when the Attachmate Extra print emulator sends an
Open(PLU) response to the SNA Server over it's SSCP-LU connection, rather than
the PLU-SLU connection. The OPEN(PLU) response uses the FMI interface which is a
trusted interface. Because this is a trusted interface SNA Server does not
verify that the destination value is correct. When the PLU session attempts to
process the incorrect response, the exception occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated the SNA Server 2.11 file, SNASERVR.EXE, to validate the
destination of the Open(PLU) response, rather than simply attempting to process
the message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
