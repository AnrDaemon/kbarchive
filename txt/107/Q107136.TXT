TITLE   :Can't Access Compressed Drives; DBLSPACE.BIN Is Not Loaded
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when you start your computer:

   You cannot access any DoubleSpace-compressed drives because DBLSPACE.BIN is
   not loaded.

NOTE: DBLSPACE.BIN is the portion of MS-DOS that provides access to
DoubleSpace-compressed drives.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you have the following line in your CONFIG.SYS file and
DBLSPACE.BIN is not in the root directory:

   device=c:\dos\dblspace.sys /move

RESOLUTION
==========

If you have DoubleSpace-compressed drives, you should copy DBLSPACE.BIN to the
root directory of your boot drive. You can either copy it from the directory
containing your MS-DOS files or expand it from your setup disks to C:\.

If you are not using DoubleSpace, remove all references to DBLSPACE.SYS from your
CONFIG.SYS file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This situation can occur when:

 - You remove MS-DOS 6.2 and Uninstall restores your pre-MS-DOS 6.2 CONFIG.SYS
   file, which includes the DEVICE command for DBLSPACE.SYS.

 - You format the host drive (to remove DoubleSpace) and then restore your
   backed up files (including your CONFIG.SYS file with the DBLSPACE.SYS
   reference).

 - You have one or more DoubleSpace-compressed drives, drive C is not
   compressed, and you delete DBLSPACE.BIN from the root directory of C.
