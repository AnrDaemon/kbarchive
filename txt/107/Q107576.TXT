======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Mail and are prompted for the
password, an option called "Remember Password" is available. This option caches
your password so that the password dialog box no longer appears when you start
Mail. However, if the Password box is blank and you select Remember Password,
the password is not cached and you are prompted for the password each time you
start Mail.

CAUSE
=====

In Windows for Workgroups 3.11, Workgroups Mail cannot cache a blank password.

WORKAROUND
==========

There is currently no resolution other than not using a blank password. If you
choose a valid password, it is cached and you don't have to log on each time you
start Mail.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 3.11
