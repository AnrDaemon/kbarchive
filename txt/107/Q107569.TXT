SUMMARY
=======

This document provides the configuration parameters required on an IBM 3174
controller acting as an APPN Network Node, supporting a downstream SNA Server
(APPN LEN Node) over 802.2. The link between the 3174 and the host or peer
system may be any link type supported by the 3174. To support PU2.1 attached
devices with independent LU6.2, the 3174 must be running microcode support level
"C" or greater.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SNA Server can access a host or peer system through an IBM 3174 APPN Network
Node. In this configuration, SNA Server is configured with an 802.2 connection
(as a PU 2.1 LEN node), which may include independent APPC LU support,
communicating through an adjacent IBM 3174 configured as an APPN Network Node.

On the SNA Server machine, do the following:

1. Run SNA Server Setup and add an 802.2 link service.

   NOTE: Link Services are added using SNA Server Manager in SNA Server version
   3.0 and later.

2. Run SNA Server Admin/Manager and configure the local SNA Server name:
    - Network Name: Must match parameter #501 in the 3174 configuration.

    - Control Point Name: Must match the CPNAME parameter (Node type #1),
      configured in the NETWORK RESOURCES and ASSOCIATED LUs in the 3174.

   In SNA Server 3.0 and later, the network name and control point can be set
   either globally as in SNA Server version 2.x or they can be set for each
   connection in the connection properties dialog box.

3. Add a Local APPC LU with the following options:
    - LU 6.2 type: Select Independent to support multiple (parallel) sessions.

    - LU Alias: Must match the Local LU name used by the Local APPC transaction
      program (refer to the product documentation).

    - Network Name: Must match parameter #501 in the 3174 configuration.

    - LU Name: In the 3174 configuration, this must match one of the 3174
      LUNAMES that is configured off the CPNAME configured on behalf of SNA
      Server. The 3174 supports up to 4 LUNAMES (for LEN nodes) off one CPNAME.

    - Choose Enable Automatic Partnering if you want SNA Server to automatically
      partner this APPC LU with all remote APPC LUs in the SNA Server
      configuration.

    - Choose "Member of Default Outgoing Local APPC LU Pool" only if the local
      APPC transaction program does not specifies a local APPC LU, and you want
      this LU to be automatically used (this is not used by most programs).

4. Configure the 802.2 connection (associated with the 802.2 link service) using
   the following properties:
    - Remote End: Peer System NOTE: Remote End: Host system must be configured
      if the connection also supports 3270 devices. This setting forces SNA
      Server to have a secondary link role, while "Peer system" allows SNA
      Server to negotiate the link role to be either primary or secondary.
      Either role will support independent LU6.2 sessions.

    - Activation: (As desired by the administrator--default for 802.2
      connections is On Server Startup.)

    - Allowed Directions: Outgoing and Incoming should be selected.

5. Set the following additional parameters:
    - Remote Network Address: Enter the network card interface address of the
      3174. This is set in Response 900 in the 3174 customization program.

    - Local Node ID: not used--leave to default.

    - Remote Node Name:
       - Network Name: Must match parameter #501 in the 3174 configuration

       - Control Point Name: Must match parameter #511 in the 3174
         configuration.

       - Remote Node ID: not needed--leave blank.

    - The Advanced settings can be left at the default settings (if remote SAP =
      04).

6. Focus on the 802.2 connection and create all required LUs off the connection,
   which can include both 3270 LUs and remote APPC LUs. To configure a Remote
   APPC LU off the connection, enter the following information in the APPC
   Remote LU Properties dialog box:
    - LU Alias: Name used by the Local APPC transaction program (refer to
      product documentation).

    - Network Name: Remote VTAM NETID (which usually matches #501 in the 3174
      configuration).

    - LU Name: Remote APPC LU name configured in VTAM (LU macro name in VTAM).

    - Uninterpreted LU Name: Usually the same as the LU Name.

    - Check Supports Parallel Sessions if you want to support multiple sessions.

    - Check Enable Automatic Partnering if you want SNA Server to automatically
      partner this APPC LU with all other Local LUs configured.

    - Implicit Incoming Mode: Not necessary.

7. Configure an APPC Mode, and partner the Local and Remote APPC LUs with the
   Mode:
    - In the Local or Remote APPC LU dialog box, zoom on the Partners button. If
      the Local and Remote LUs are not already partnered with the desired APPC
      mode name, zoom on the Modes button.

    - To create a new Mode, enter the new Mode name over an existing Mode. This
      Mode name must match the "DLOGMOD" entry in the Remote APPC LU macro in
      VTAM.

    - Partner your Local APPC LU and Remote APPC LU with this new mode, if they
      are not already partnered together.

8. Optional: Configure pools of LUs in the LU Pools dialog box of SNA Server
   Admin, if you want to create pools of 3270 LUs for your users.

9. Assign LUs and/or LU Pools to the appropriate users and groups. This is not
   necessary for APPC, though is required for user access to 3270 sessions.

10. Save the configuration, and then restart SNA Server.

On the IBM 3174 machine, do the following:

1. Using the 3174 configuration utility, configure downstream devices in Panel
   940. Enter the SNA Server network card (MAC) address in this panel. (You can
   find the network card address of the SNA Server machine by entering "NET
   CONFIG WKSTA" from the command line of the Windows NT machine).

2. Configure the SNA Server control point name in the NETWORK RESOURCES option,
   as well as the Local APPC LU names as "LUNAMES" in the ASSOCIATED LUs section
   for the control point.

3. Complete the 3174 configuration and reload it according to 3174 procedures.

For CICS and VTAM information for LU6.2, see the SNA server Administration Guide
(SY57265-09/94) page 111.

Also note the configuration questions for the 3174 change from level to level of
3174 microcode. Be sure to use the correct 3174 planning guide for the microcode
installed in the 3174.
