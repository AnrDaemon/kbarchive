TITLE   :Writer: No Network Setup Option on Lantastic
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Kids Products
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
 - Microsoft Fine Artist for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Creative Writer or Fine Artist on a computer that is on a
Lantastic network, the setup program may not offer you the option to do a
network installation.

This occurs if Windows does not recognize the presence of a network drive.
Lantastic is a peer-to-peer network. Using Lantastic, you can connect to another
computer in such a way that it appears to your Windows installation as if it
were a local drive. For the Creative Writer and Fine Artist network setup to be
available, you must connect to the other computer (or "server") in such a way
that it appears to your Windows installation to be a network drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you do not see a network setup button in Creative Writer or Fine Artist
Setup, do the following:

1. Exit from the setup program.

2. Start File Manager. Look at the icon of your network drive. If it looks the
   same as the icon of your hard drive, you have not connected to the other
   computer correctly.

3. From the Main group, choose Windows Setup.

4. From the Options menu, choose Change System Settings.

5. From the Network list, select the Lantastic network driver. Choose OK.

6. Return to File Manager and double check that the shared drive now has a
   network drive icon.

When the shared drive is recognized by Windows to be a network drive, you should
be able to do a network installation of Creative Writer.
