The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Multimedia Viewer Publishing Toolkit, versions 2.0, 2.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Viewer title can have at most 200 total word wheels and topic
groups. This limit includes browse sequences, which are a special type
of topic group. Page 4-11 of the Microsoft Multimedia Viewer
Publishing Toolkit "Technical Reference" incorrectly says that the
limit on the number of groups applies only to searchable groups; the
limit applies to the combined total of all groups and word wheels.

If more than 200 groups and word wheels are defined in the .MVP file,
the Viewer compiler, WMVC.EXE, will generate the warning 8041:
"Entry/Exit macro specification overflow." Any group footnotes in the
RTF file that reference a group over the 200 limit will generate the
warning 8161: "Bad group reference; all groups must be declared in the
project file."

Additional query words: 2.00 2.00a
