======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

If you have Windows for Workgroups 3.11 running on a Novell network, Windows for
Workgroups will support direct hosting only on machines running Novell's ODI
drivers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Direct hosting is a new feature in Windows for Workgroups 3.11 that allows the
virtual redirector to interface with the IPX/SPX Compatible protocol, bypassing
NetBIOS. This new technology allows the redirector to transfer data faster
across the network.

For direct hosting to work correctly, the IPX/SPX Compatible protocol must be
installed. This protocol cannot be installed on machines running IPX.COM or
ArcNet; therefore, direct hosting does not work on these machines.

Additional query words: 3.11 3rdparty
