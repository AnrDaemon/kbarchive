TITLE   :WFWG 3.11 Err Msg: Segment Load Failure
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to open or copy a file larger than 2 megabytes (MB), you may
receive one of the following error messages:

   Segment Load Failure

-or-

   Insufficient Memory

CAUSE
=====

These errors occur if both of the following conditions exist:

 - You are using a permanent swap file without 32-bit disk access enabled. This
   causes paging to occur through MS-DOS.

   -and-

 - You are using 32-bit file access. Since 32-bit disk access is disabled, the
   real-mode mapper (RMM.D32) is used to provide 32-bit file services.

These errors do not occur if the permanent swap file is on a drive with 32-bit
disk access enabled or if 32-bit file access is disabled.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around these errors do one of the following:

 - If your hard disk controller is WD1003 compatible, enable 32-bit disk
   access.

   -or-

 - Disable 32-bit file access.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Bases as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This size of the file needed to trigger this error is not always 2 MB. The limit
is 512 multiplied by the size of the allocation unit for the drive where the
target file resides. The allocation unit size is commonly 4096 bytes, thus the
apparent 2 MB limit. In cases in which the allocation unit size is different,
the limit is also different.
