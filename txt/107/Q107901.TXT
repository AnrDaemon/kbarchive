KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1 
 - Microsoft Fine Artist for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

It may take several minutes to insert a large sound file from a floppy disk in
Creative Writer or Fine Artist. For example, inserting a 200K sound from a
floppy disk may take up to 12 minutes.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Creative Writer and Fine Artist,
versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To speed up the process of inserting a large sound, copy it from the floppy disk
to your hard drive first, then insert it into the program.
