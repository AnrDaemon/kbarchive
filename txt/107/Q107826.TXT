TITLE   :PRB: COMMAND+W and CTRL+W Do Not Close All Windows
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.5b,3.0b

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.5b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Pressing COMMAND+W or CTRL+W does not close every window that has a close box,
as the ESC key does.

For example, clicking the close box or choosing Close from the File menu in a
screen, menu, or report invokes the following dialog box if any changes were
made:

   

   Do you want to save changes to XXX.SCX?
 
   Yes        No        Cancel

Pressing COMMAND+W or CTRL+W immediately saves any changes and closes the file,
bypassing the "Do you want to save changes?" dialog box. If a new report or
screen is being created, a second "Save Environment?" dialog box will appear
regardless of the method used to close the file.

However, if COMMAND+W or CTRL+W is pressed in other windows, such as the Debug
window, a character will appear in the window and the window will remain open.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. The intent of the COMMAND+W or CTRL+W key
combination is to allow you to bypass the "Do you want to save changes?" dialog
box. This key combination cannot be used to close windows that do not invoke
this dialog box.
