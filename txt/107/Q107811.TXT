The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WFW<nn> files (where <nn> is a sequential number) may appear in your
Windows directory. These files are copies of your system files (CONFIG.SYS,
AUTOEXEC.BAT, SYSTEM.INI, and WIN.INI). Setup creates these files so that
it can make modifications to your system. When Setup is finished, it
removes these files.

If Setup stops responding (hangs) or you stop Setup before it has completed
installation, Windows does not remove these files from your system. You
should manually remove them after Setup completes successfully.

Additional query words: 3.11 network setup
