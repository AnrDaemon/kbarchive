SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Remote Access with an unsupported modem, you may encounter poorly
formatted or unreadable error messages.

CAUSE
=====

When modems return errors, they usually return unformatted text (which can vary
in length). Remote Access simply displays this text. If the modem is not on the
Windows for Workgroups hardware compatibility list, Microsoft cannot guarantee
it will return usable error messages. For example, the Dallas FAX modem returns
error messages that are unreadable when displayed by Remote Access.
