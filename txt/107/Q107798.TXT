MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows for Workgroups 3.11 can be loaded without the 386 enhanced mode drivers
by using the following command:

   win /d:t

Loading Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with this command line can be helpful when
you are troubleshooting issues associated with the 386 enhanced mode drivers.

When 386 enhanced mode drivers are not loaded, the WSWAP.EXE terminate-and-
stay-resident (TSR) program is used to allow Windows to switch between
MS-DOS-based applications and Windows. This file must be present when you load
Windows with the command line shown above.

WSWAP.EXE is installed to the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory by the Windows Setup
program and is always present unless it has been manually deleted from the hard
disk.
