======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows for Workgroups, you may receive one of the following
error messages:

   Error 6200: Adapter <adapter-name> not found

   -or-

   Error 58: The network has responded incorrectly

NOTE: These errors usually occur in protected mode; real-mode networking usually
loads correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The above error messages may be caused by an incorrect I/O base address, an
incorrect RAM address, or an improper IRQ setting in the PROTOCOL.INI file.

These errors may be generated if the Transport= line in the [386Enh] section of
the SYSTEM.INI contains protocols that are not in use. For example, if the
Transport= line contains the following

        Transport=netbeui.386,nwlink.386,nwnblink.386

but the only protocol in use is NetBeui, the errors may occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

Correct the invalid setting.

If the Transport= line contains invalid references, remove them (that is, remove
the references to nwlink.386, nwnblink.386, and IPX/SPX compatible transport).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The NDIS2 network interface card (NIC) driver may not rely on the PROTOCOL.INI
settings; however, the NDIS3 NIC driver relies almost exclusively on these
settings.
