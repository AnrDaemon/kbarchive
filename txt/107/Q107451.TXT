PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the TN3270 Server converts LU-SSCP clear-text-format data from the host
into 3270 datastream format because TN3270 clients expect to receive data in
3270 datastream format from the host, the TN3270 Server incorrectly inserts new
rows causing the bottom rows to wrap around to the top of the screen.

CAUSE
=====

The TN3270 Server formatting code does not correctly handle the newline
character at the end of a line.


RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated the file <tnroot>\TN3SERVR.EXE to correct this
problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
