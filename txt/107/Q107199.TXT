The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows Help does not retain its maximized window position when you restart it.

CAUSE
=====

Windows Help screens save their settings on closing by writing their window
positions to the [Windows Help] section of the WIN.INI file. Help screens that
you have maximized do not retain a maximized window position when you restart
Help. The screens open up in a large framed window rather than full screen and
shift to the right on the desktop.

WORKAROUND
==========

NOTE: The following workarounds require that the Help screens remain in a window
and are not maximized.

 - Use the mouse to drag the borders of the Help window to the desired size,
   then close the window.

   -or-

 - Edit the [Help] section of the WIN.INI file with the following statements for
   your video mode:

   1024 x 768 SVGA:

      [Windows Help]
      H_WindowPosition=[266,200,266,200,0]
      M_WindowPosition=[0,0,1024,768,0]

   800 x 600 SVGA:

      [Windows Help]
      H_WindowPosition=[266,200,266,200,0]
      M_WindowPosition=[0,0,800,600,0]

   640 x 480 VGA:

      [Windows Help]
      H_WindowPosition=[266,200,266,200,0]
      M_WindowPosition=[0,0,640,480,0]

   640 x 350 EGA:

      [Windows Help]
      H_WindowPosition=[266,200,266,200,0]
      M_WindowPosition=[0,0,640,350,0]

Any attempt to maximize the Help screen by using the maximize button or by
double-clicking the title bar overwrites the changes in the WIN.INI file. Window
placement must then be changed with the mouse or by editing the WIN.INI file. A
comment or REM line containing the proper values can be added to the WIN.INI so
that these values are readily available if the Help window is accidentally
maximized. For example:

      [Windows Help]

      H_WindowPosition=[266,200,266,200,0]
      ;H_WindowPosition=[266,200,266,200,0]
      M_WindowPosition=[0,0,1024,768,0]
      ;M_WindowPosition=[0,0,1024,768,0]

NOTE: To achieve the exact size and position of the desktop for the Help window,
the WIN.INI file must be edited. Using the mouse for placement leaves a slight
border of the desktop outside the Help window or places the Help window border
slightly off the desktop.
