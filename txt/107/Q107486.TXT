The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
 - Microsoft Fine Artist for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If when you install Creative Writer or Fine Artist to a network, you type in a
very long path of nonexistent subdirectories to install to, you may receive the
following erroneous error message:

   There isn't enough free space on that disk to set up the program. Or you may
   not have permission to write to that disk. To choose another disk, click OK.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Creative Writer and Fine Artist,
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.1a. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error only occurs if you enter a very long path of subdirectory names, such
as the following (where each number or letter represents a directory):

   c:\1\2\3\4\5\6\7\8\9\0\a\b\c\d\e\f\g\h\i\j\k\l\m\n\o\p\q\r\s\t\u\v\w\x\y\z
