The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After you run SETUP /H with Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and reboot the machine,
you may receive the following error message after the NET START command is run
from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   PRO0011E: Equal sign missing between keyword and value Error loading device
   driver PROTMAN.DOS

MORE INFORMATION
================

SETUP /H:<FILE>, where <FILE> is the name of the system settings
file, is a batch mode process that sets up Windows for Workgroups with little or
no user interaction. SETUP.SHH, located on Disk 1, is the systems settings
template that can be copied or modified to create a custom system settings
file.

This error message occurs when the MakeProtocol=yes entry appears in the
[network] section of the SETUP.SHH file and the [protocol.ini] section is
missing. This results in invalid sections that the NET command cannot read being
written to the PROTOCOL.INI file. Removing these unnecessary sections in the
PROTOCOL.INI file corrects this problem.

The [protocol.ini] section tells Setup which sections from the SETUP.SHH file to
delete after it creates the new PROTOCOL.INI file. The [protocol.ini] section in
the SETUP.SHH file was not required in installations prior to Windows for
Workgroups 3.11.

Additional query words: 3.11 protman setup/h
