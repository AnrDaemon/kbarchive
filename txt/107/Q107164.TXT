TITLE   :PRB: .FLI and .FLC Files Don't Play
PRODUCT :Miscellaneous Software Development Kits
PROD/VER::2.0,2.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Multimedia Viewer Publishing Toolkit, versions 2.0, 2.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Viewer displays a "Cannot Display" error box wherever a .FLI or .FLC file is
referenced in a topic via an embedded MCI pane statement. The syntax of the
embedded MCI pane statement can be any of the following:

   {ewc MVMCI2,ViewerMCI,[options]![FLI/FLC-file]}
   {ewl MVMCI2,ViewerMCI,[options]![FLI/FLC-file]}
   {ewr MVMCI2,ViewerMCI,[options]![FLC/FLC-file]}

CAUSE
=====

Autodesk's MCI driver for playing .FLI and .FLC files (MCIAAP.DRV) returns an
incorrect error when Viewer uses mciSendCommand() to send it a MCI_WINDOW
message with the flags MCI_ANIM_WINDOW_HWND and MCI_WAIT.

RESOLUTION
==========

The .FLI and .FLC files can be played with the MCIAAP.DRV driver, provided the
MCI_WINDOW command message is not sent. In fact, .FLI and .FLC files can be
played with Media Player and with the MCITEST sample application from the
Windows 3.1 Software Development Kit (SDK). To play .FLI and .FLC files from
Viewer, you could write your own dynamic-link library (DLL), which would use
mciSendCommand() to send commands to play the animation files. There is no way
to use Viewer's MVMCI2.DLL to play a .FLI or .FLC file.

The information in this article applies to the MCIAAP.DRV that is dated 2-8-93
and is 16912 bytes long.
