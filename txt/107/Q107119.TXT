TITLE   :Local and Remote Control Point Names Can't be the Same
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.11

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you have difficulty making a connection with a link, confirm that the local
and remote Control Point names are not the same. A common cause of connection
difficulties with a new configuration is that the same names have been specified
for both local and remote Control Point and Network names.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In SNA Server Admin, the local Control Point and Network names are set in a
different dialog box than the remote Control Point and Network names. The local
Control Point Name and Network Name apply to all connections, and are set in the
Server Properties dialog box. The remote Control Point Name and Network Name for
a particular connection are set in the Connection Properties dialog box.

 - The local network name and control point name (configured in the Server
   dialog) identify the SNA Server node to the SNA network.

 - The remote network name and remote control point name (configured in the
   connection dialog) identify the remote node name that you want to connect to.

 - These should never be set to the same value. If they are, the connection will
   show up as "Pending" and never activate (note that there are other causes for
   a Pending status besides this possible configuration problem).

To verify duplicate names use SNA Admin and do the following:

1. In the Servers and Connections window, choose Services.

2. Select Properties.

3. Make a note of the SNA Server Network Control Point Name.
