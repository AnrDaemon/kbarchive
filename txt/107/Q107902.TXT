TITLE   :Writer 1: Can't Use the Keyboard to Highlight Text
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Kids Products
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:1.0,1.1,1.1a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On some older keyboards, you may not be able to highlight text using the arrow
keys. When you press "SHIFT+LEFT ARROW" (without the quotation marks) or
"SHIFT+RIGHT ARROW" (without the quotation marks), the cursor does not move to
the left or right and highlight the text. Instead, plus and asterisk characters
are typed.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Creative Writer versions 1.0 and
1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

If your keyboard is demonstrating this problem, use the mouse instead to
highlight text.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem has been found to occur on older, non-ADB (Apple Desktop Bus)
keyboards
