SUMMARY
=======

You can use the Intel SatisFAXtion 100 fax modem as either a Class 1 or CAS
modem type with Microsoft At Work PC Fax.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Intel SatisFAXtion 100 and 400E fax modems are CAS only when either
CASMGR.EXE or CASMODEM.EXE (provided by Intel) is installed in the AUTOEXEC.BAT
file. If neither driver is installed, the fax modem becomes Class 1 compatible,
which is the desired configuration for use with Microsoft At Work PC Fax.

The advantage to Class 1 is that Microsoft At Work PC Fax can control more
aspects of the fax modem and allow binary file transfer.

CASMGR is a driver supplied by Intel for communicating between MS-DOS and the CAS
hardware on the fax modem.
