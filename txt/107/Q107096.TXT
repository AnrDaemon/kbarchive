SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, you can make semi-
automatic address list exchanges that do not require the administrator to start
them manually.

To import a PROFS address list into MS Mail, run the Microsoft Mail ADMIN.EXE and
select the GATEWAY, PROFS, and IMPORT menu to generate a TOKEN. This is a
special message that directs the PROFS Gateway host access component to reply
with the address list for users on a particular VM node.

EXAMPLE
-------

Here is an example token that instructs the PROFS gateway to download the address
list for all TESTNODE users and send the list to the MS Mail postoffice with
node (postoffice) name PROFS30. The address list is prepared and sent to
PROFS30, where it is automatically imported:
