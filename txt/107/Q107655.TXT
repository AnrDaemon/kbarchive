KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may find that borders do not print, and that only your text and/or graphics
appear on the printout. This occurs if you are using the Dell VGA 640 x 480 or
800 x 600 256-color video drivers and are printing to a PostScript printer. The
problem does not occur if you either switch to the standard VGA driver or print
to a non-PostScript printer.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Creative Writer versions 1.0, 1.1
and 1.1a. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, do one of the following:

 - If available, obtain a newer version of the Dell 256-color video driver you
   are using. The problem may be corrected in newer versions of the drivers.

 - Install another 256-color driver supported by your video card, if available.

 - Install the standard Windows VGA video driver.

 - Print to a non-PostScript printer.

After changing video drivers, restart Windows and try printing the document
again.

For more information on Dell video drivers, contact Dell Computer Corporation's
technical support department at (800) 624-9896.
