The DoubleSpace Stacker Conversion routine online help contains the
following statement:

   You can also convert a Stacker volume file from the MS-DOS prompt using the
   dblspace /convstac command. For more information, type " HELP DBLSPACE
   /CONVSTAC" (without the quotation marks) at the command prompt.

This is incorrect; there is no help about DBLSPACE /CONVSTAC in MS-DOS
Help.

NOTE: You cannot use the DBLSPACE /CONVSTAC command until you have
converted your Stacker-compressed drives to DoubleSpace-compressed
drives. You can then use DBLSPACE /CONVSTAC to convert your Stacker
compressed removable media disks to DoubleSpace-compressed removable
media disks.
