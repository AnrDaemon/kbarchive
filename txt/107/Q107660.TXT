TITLE   :Writer: Drop Caps Not Aligned with Indented Paragraph

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0 
 - Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Creative Writer Writing Studio, drop caps are not indented if you have
indented the rest of the paragraph. If you indent all lines of a paragraph, the
drop cap will hang out on the left, as if you had chosen a hanging indent.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Creative Writer version 1.0, 1.1
and 1.1a. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To make the drop cap align with the rest of the paragraph, choose either "Indent
no lines" or "Indent only the first line" as your indentation style. If you
choose either "Indent all but the first line" or "Indent all lines," the drop
cap will hang outside of the upper left corner of the paragraph.

NOTE: Unlike drop caps, pop caps and bullets are indented correctly regardless of
the indentation style you choose.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. In the Writing Studio, type a paragraph of text.

2. Click on the bank switcher (the red-handled lever). A new array of options
   appears.

3. Click on the indents tool (it's just to the left of the paint can, and
   depicts a paragraph with an arrow on the first line).

4. Choose the "Indent all lines" indentation style and click on your paragraph
   to apply the formatting.

5. Click on the paragraph styles tool (a picture of a paragraph with a giant
   letter "B") and choose Drop Caps.

The drop cap hangs off the left side of the paragraph, instead of being indented
as one would expect.

Note: In Creative Writer 2, you cannot add both Indent First Line Only and Drop
Caps styles to the same paragraph, so this is not an issue.
