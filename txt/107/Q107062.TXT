The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

With version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, if your Mail message file
(MMF) is on your local hard disk, you must run SHARE.EXE before you start
Microsoft Windows.

If this is your first installation of any Microsoft Mail product and your .MMF
file is on your local hard disk, you need to run SHARE.EXE, start Windows, and
then run the Mail Remote Setup program (SETUP.EXE) to install Microsoft Mail
Remote for Windows.

If SHARE.EXE is not loaded before Windows is loaded, Mail will not start, and the
file that contains your messages cannot be accessed by other mail- related
applications.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SHARE.EXE enables each program that accesses your message file to lock portions
of the file and protect the other mail-related applications from overwriting
information in the file.

If you are running the version of Mail shipped with Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups version 3.1 in 386-enhanced mode, VSHARE.386 is loaded automatically
and SHARE.EXE is not needed.

The Setup program installs SHARE.EXE in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file if it detects that
it is needed. You need to restart your computer in order for the change to take
effect.
