The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows for Workgroups 3.1 and 3.11 have a limit of four protocols per
network card and a maximum of eight protocols that can be installed at any
given time.

If you are using NDIS 2.0 drivers and the NetBEUI protocol in Windows for
Workgroups 3.11, you can add only two additional protocols. This differs
from version 3.1, in which you can load up to four protocols, including
NetBEUI. If you are using all NDIS 3.0 drivers in Windows for Workgroups
3.11, you can use four protocols per card.

This limitation exists because the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 NetBEUI
protocol requires two bindings to the protocol manager: one binding for
real mode (NDISHLP.SYS) and one for protected mode (NETBEUI.386). If the
NetBEUI protocol is removed, up to four other protocols can be used.
