The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 caches disk writes by default when the
32-bit file system is enabled. This includes MS-DOS DoubleSpace 6.2 volumes;
however, it does not include third-party disk-compression systems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To disable write caching with the 32-bit file system, add the following line to
the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file:

        ForceLazyOff=<drivelist>

where <drivelist> is the list of drives in which you want to disable write
caching. (Do not use any delimiters or spaces.) For example, the line

        ForceLazyOff=CDF

would disable write caching on drives C, D, and F.

For more information about the 32-bit file system, query on the following words
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   wfwg and vfat and 32-bit
