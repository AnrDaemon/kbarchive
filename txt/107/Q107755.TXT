The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Messaging Application Program Interface (MAPI) MAPIFindNext function may not
find a MAPISaveMail ID when the last 24 characters of that message ID contain
nonzero values.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MAPISaveMail saves a message ID with the first 16 characters containing possible
nonzero values. The remaining 24 characters always contain zero values. When
MAPIFindNext is used to search through messages, it will not find a MAPISaveMail
message ID if the last 24 characters of that message ID contain nonzero values.
The characters beyond 16 characters contain information MAPI uses to speed up
MAPIFindNext calls.

In order to access a message saved with MAPISaveMail, use MAPIReadMail. The first
16 bytes is the only information necessary for MAPIReadMail to open the message.
