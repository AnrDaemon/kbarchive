TITLE   :SETUP /E Message: Cannot Identify Your Version of DOS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install MS-DOS 6.2 or 6.22 Step-Up and then use your MS-DOS 6.0 Upgrade
disks to run SETUP /E (to install the optional utilities), you receive the
following error message:

   Cannot identify your version of DOS

CAUSE
=====

Because you have upgraded to MS-DOS 6.2 or 6.22, you cannot run Setup from an
earlier version of MS-DOS.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Follow the procedure in the "Updating Microsoft Backup, Undelete and
   Anti-Virus" in the README.NOW file (located on your Step-Up disk or in the
   directory that contains your downloaded Step-Up files).

   NOTE: The procedure is not duplicated here because it is different for the
   retail version and the downloadable (BBS) version of Step-Up.

-or-

 - Uninstall MS-DOS 6.2 or 6.22, run MS-DOS 6.0 Setup with the /E parameter, and
   then reinstall MS-DOS 6.2 or 6.22 Step-Up.
