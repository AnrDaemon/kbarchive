-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

For display purposes, Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 gets the message
originator's name from the P2 of the X.400 message. If the originator field is
not included in the P2 then the Gateway cannot display the message originator to
you.

The X.400 implementation functions this way for two reasons:

 - The NIST Stable Implementor Agreements require all NIST-compliant
   implementations, supporting P2, to generate the P2 originator.

 - OSTC requires the same of OSTC-compliant implementations for Europe and
   Australia.
