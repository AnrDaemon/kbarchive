TITLE   :SNA Server Event 553 Running Novell Requestor for Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server Admin hangs on startup and the SnaBase service encounters the
following error if Windows NT is installed with the Novell NetWare Requestor for
Windows NT, version 1.01:

   Event 567:
   Creation of named pipe failed, rc = 10048

   Event 624:
   Creating dump file c:\sna\traces\SNADUMP.LOG for SNABASE.EXE

CAUSE
=====

The SnaBase service attempts to open the same socket number on both IPX and SPX,
although the Novell IPX/SPX driver for Windows NT does not allow this, returning
socket error 10048 which means the address is already in use. Event 624 is
logged to indicate that an unrecoverable error detected by SnaBase.

RESOLUTION
==========

An update to SNA Server 2.11 corrects this problem by supporting the ability to
configure the SPX port number used by the SnaBase service.

Microsoft has updated the following files to correct this problem:

   On the server and Windows NT clients:  <snaroot>\SYSTEM\SNANW.DLL
   Windows 95 clients:                    <win95root>\SYSTEM\SNACNW.DLL
   Windows 3.x clients:                   <winroot>\SYSTEM\NWCLI.DLL

To configure the SPX port number, install the new file and add the following
registry value on the server under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree under the
following subkey:

   /SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/SnaBase/  Parameters/SnaSpx

Value Name: SnaBasePort
Data Type:  REG_DWORD
Data:       <hexadecimal number>

<hexadecimal number> is the port number in hexadecimal. This number must
not match the default of 0x84C8.

When this parameter is specified the SnaBase uses the new port number for client
"sponsor" connections over SPX. The default port number (0x84C8, or 33992 in
decimal) is still used for server to server (IPX) communication. This fix
requires an update to all clients (except MS-DOS based clients) because the
clients assume that the SnaBase SPX port is always 0x84C8. However, there is no
client-side entry required because the server port number is found dynamically
through the Netware bindery.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
