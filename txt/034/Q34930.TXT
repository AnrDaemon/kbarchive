KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 5.1, 5.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The example code below causes the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) versions 5.10
and 5.10a to generate the error message,

   run-time error R6000
   - stack overflow

CAUSE
=====

The redefinition of a symbol. It is defined as an equate and as a macro.

RESOLUTION

The workaround is to remove the redefinition of "xx". MASM version 6.0 and later
correctly generate errors in this situation

   A2008: syntax error: macro
   A1008: unmatched macro nesting

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with MASM versions 5.10 and 5.10a.
This problem was corrected in MASM version 6.00.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample code demonstrates the problem.
