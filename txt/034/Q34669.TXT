======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS, versions 3.x, 4.x, 5.01, 5.1x, 5.3, 5.31.009, 5.5, 5.6 
 - Microsoft LINK for OS/2, versions 5.1x, 5.3, 5.31.009 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to link an application fails and Microsoft LINK generates the
following message:

   L1087: Unexpected end-of-file on scratch file

CAUSE
=====

LINK generates this error when a problem occurs with the disk that holds the
temporary linker-output file. This disk can be a floppy disk, a hard disk, or a
RAM disk. Most likely, one of the following occurred:

 - The disk that holds the temporary file was removed from its drive.

 - The disk that holds the temporary file has insufficient space to hold the
   file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure that the disk is available and that is has enough free space to
contain the linker-output file. If the error persists, change the TMP
environment variable to specify a directory on a hard disk instead of a RAM
disk.
