The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If the last line in a batch file is a label and there is no carriage return
character after the label, the command immediately preceding the label will be
executed twice.

The workaround for this problem is to include a carriage return at the end of a
label.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS versions 3.3, 3.30a, 4.0,
and 5.0. This problem was corrected in MS-DOS version 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following batch file

echo hello <cr>
:label <cr>
<eof>

will produce the following output:

C>echo hello
hello

C>
C>

If the carriage return after the label is omitted, as follows

echo hello <cr>
:label <eof>

the file will produce the following output:

C>echo hello
hello
hello

C>
C>
