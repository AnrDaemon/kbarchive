TITLE   :DOCERR: PROC Directive Will Not Work with Structure Type
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::5.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 5.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Page 38 of the "Microsoft Macro Assembler 5.1 Update" guide states the following
about the type that can be specified for an argument in the syntax of PROC

   ... the type of the argument may be WORD, DWORD, FWORD, QWORD,
   TBYTE or the name of a structure defined by a STRUC structure
   declaration...

When attempting to use a structure name, the following error will be generated

   error A2003: Unknown type specifier

The error is generated because support of the STRUC type for arguments to PROC
has not been added to MASM version 5.1. However, it is a feature of MASM version
6.0 and later.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following program illustrates the problem. It will assemble correctly with
MASM 6.0 and later.

Sample Code
-----------

   ; Assembly options needed: none

      .model small,c
      .data

   t1 STRUC
      w1  dw 0
   t1 ENDS

      .code

   h1 PROC arg1:t1
   ;
   h1 ENDP

      END

Additional query words: 5.10
