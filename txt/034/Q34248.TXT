======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

Option A, Automatic Scenery Loading, appears on the Scenery Library menu (from
the NAV/COM menu, choose Option 2, Scenery Load) only if there are two or more
converted scenery files in the Flight Simulator subdirectory. If you select
Option A and a scenery file is available for the area in which you are flying,
that scenery file is supposed to be automatically loaded and used while you fly
within its boundaries; however, this feature is not functional in Microsoft
Flight Simulator version 3.00. You must manually load the scenery file from the
Scenery Load menu after setting its position to the desired scenery area (from
the NAV/COM menu, choose Option A, Position Set).

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Flight Simulator version 3.00.
This problem was corrected in Flight Simulator version 4.00. Updated or new
Microsoft software can be ordered in the US by contacting Microsoft End User
Sales and Service at (800) 426-9400. International customers should see

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Flight Simulator version 4.00, Automatic Scenery Loading works properly if
the Converts program properly handles the scenery disk being used. Some newer
SubLOGIC scenery disks require a different SubLOGIC CONVERTS.EXE program. For
information about using scenery disks, contact SubLOGIC Corporation at (800)
637-4983.
