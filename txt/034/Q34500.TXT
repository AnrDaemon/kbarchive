TITLE   :FIX: Mixing \ and / in Command Line Causes Problems
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::5.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 5.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When mixing \ and / on the MASM command line, MASM will sometimes give incorrect
results and hang. The following command line causes these problems:

   masm -I\sl200qr\sl -Mx -DVERS_DDQR -I\sl200qr/sl/cmerge/src/Common
    \sl200qr/sl/cmerge/src/Common/comsup.asm;

The option -Mx will be ignored. MASM also hangs when processing some assembler
files.

CAUSE
=====

In this case, MASM was incorrectly extracting the base name; it wrote the full
path into an array big enough only for an 8.3 filename, thus overwriting many
global flags.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 5.1. This problem
was corrected in MASM version 5.1a.
