SUMMARY
=======

The Localizer is used in ILS landings. It is a sort of VOR that can be used only
on one radial, which is lined up with the runway. You tune it in on your NAV
radio like a normal VOR station, but you do not set the OBI to a radial
direction, because the direction is set automatically. Needle movement is four
times as sensitive as a normal VOR station, so you can hold your horizontal
course very precisely.

You can lock on the Localizer frequency by tuning in to the ATIS for the six
airports that have the ILS landing capabilities. The following six airports will
give you a localizer frequency.

   Martha's Vineyard
   Champaign, Illinois
   Snohomish County (Paine field)
   Van Nuys, California
   Metro Oakland International
   Chicago-O'Hare International (Runway 27R)
