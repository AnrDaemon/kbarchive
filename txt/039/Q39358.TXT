======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

When flying in areas provided on additional scenery disks (supplied by SubLOGIC
Corporation), NDB (Non-Directional Beacon) navigation does not function. The
needle on the ADF (Automatic Direction Finder) bearing indicator will ignore the
position of the nondirectional beacon when tuned to a local NDB frequency.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Version 3.00. We are researching
this problem and will post new information as it becomes available.
