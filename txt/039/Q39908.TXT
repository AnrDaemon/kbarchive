The Microsoft time functions calculate for daylight saving time. In
particular, mktime() will set the hour ahead or back one hour
according to the rules of daylight saving time. The only way to change
the dates that the time functions use in calculating daylight saving
time is to get the run-time library source code available for the time
functions and modify the routine _isindst() in the file TZSET.C.
