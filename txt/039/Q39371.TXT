-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 5.0, 5.1, 5.1a, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A program which uses the .MODEL directive and has a procedure which receives
arguments, will not assemble correctly if a language is not specified. Under
Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) versions 5.0, 5.1, and 5.1a, the language is
specified with the .MODEL directive and the following errors will be produced
the language is omitted:

   A2022: Operand must be type specifier
   A2009: Symbol not defined: 'symbol'

Under MASM 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0b, the language can be specified as part of the PROC
syntax, with the .MODEL directive, with OPTION LANG, or with switches /Gc or
/Gd. The following errors will be produced if the language is not specified

   A2119: language type must be specified
   A2006: undefined symbol: 'symbol'

The "Microsoft Macro Assembler Programmer's Guide" does not indicate that the
language parameter is required in this case.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The language parameter on the .MODEL directive enables the PROC extensions,
changes the scope of code labels within procedures, and may affect naming. When
the language parameter is left off, the PROC directive will only accept a NEAR
or FAR specifier.

The following sample program illustrates the situation:

Sample Code
-----------

   ;Assemble options needed: none

           .model small
   ;       .model small, c             ; This line will permit assembly.

           .code

   myadd   PROC arg1:word, arg2:word

           LES bx, arg1
           LES dx, arg2

           RET
   myadd   ENDP

           END
