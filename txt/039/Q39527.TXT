SUMMARY
=======

The table of reserved words in MASM on Page 69 of the "Microsoft Macro Assembler
Programmer's Guide" does not include DUP. DUP is an operator for defining
arrays, buffers and other data structures consisting of multiple data objects of
the same size. DUP cannot be used as a variable. For example, the following
statement allocates the string "Test " five times for a total of 20 bytes:

      DB   5 DUP ("Test ")

Additional query words: 5.10
