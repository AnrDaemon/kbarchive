SUMMARY
=======

When using IF directives, relational operators could be used to form the
conditions. Note: The relational operators treat the expressions as follows:

   EQ and NE treat their operators as 16-bit numbers

   LT, LE, GT, and GE treat their operators as 17-bit numbers.

The relational operators cannot be used for comparing string arguments. It is
often necessary to compare string arguments in MACROs. IFIDN and IFDIF
directives are available for this purpose. IFIDN grants assembly if two
arguments are identical; IFDIF grants assembly if two arguments are different.
The syntax is as follows:

       IFIDN <argument1>,<argument2>
       IFDIF <argument1>,<argument2>
