The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, MS-DOS workstation, versions 1.37, 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The IBM PC/XT or a PC/XT compatible uses interrupt 5 for the hard disk
controller. To avoid conflicts, no devices installed in an XT should use
interrupt 5. To reduce the possiblity of conflicts between other applications
and software drivers, set the DMA (direct memory access) channel to 1; note also
that the software interrupt should be located at address 60.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following table shows some of the common devices that might be installed in
an XT, the interrupts used by these devices (in brackets []), and the possible
interrupt settings for the Farallon LocalTalk card or compatible cards:
