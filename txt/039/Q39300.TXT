TITLE   :Mac DOS: No Error Message if Invalid Value in MAIL.INI
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For Appletalk Networks
PROD/VER::1.37
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, MS-DOS workstation, version 1.37 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you modify the MAIL.INI file for Microsoft Mail (PC Client) to change the
default settings for starting a Mail session, and you enter an invalid value for
an option, no appropriate error message will be displayed upon starting Mail.

NOTE: This article applies only to Mail version 1.37. An invalid character in the
MAIL.INI file for Mail version 2.00 or 3.00 will generate an error message.

To avoid this problem, do not change the MAIL.INI file using a text-editor
program like the DOS line-editor program Edlin. Instead, change your AppleTalk
network zone, network server, and color display settings by rerunning the Setup
program. Print options (margins, printer port, etc.) can be changed within Mail
from the File menu using the Print Options selection. Do not change the default
file types for file attachments.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information on Edlin, see your MS-DOS manual. For information on
changing the zone= and server= statements of the MAIL.INI file, read the section
titled "Installing a Microsoft Mail PC Workstation" on Page 4 of the "Microsoft
Mail User's Guide."
