SUMMARY
=======

The memory limit for a Windows list box depends strictly on the number of
characters, not on the number of items in the list box. The memory for the
strings is allocated from global memory, but the internal code assumes that the
total amount of memory required by the strings in the list box will not exceed
32K (in Windows versions 2.x). If the total memory required by the strings is
more than 32K, the list box will not function correctly.

Under Windows version 3.0, the limit is 64K of text.

Additional query words: listbox
