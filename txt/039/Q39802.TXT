SUMMARY
=======

The limits of the logical coordinate system are from -32768 to +32767. An item
can be drawn anywhere within this coordinate system; however, the window extent
cannot be set to greater than 32767. (Although this might seem to limit the
system to the -16384 to 16383 range, this is not the case.) If the viewport and
window are set up properly, everything will be shown. For example, to set up the
whole logical coordinate system to be shown within the application's area of the
screen, the following code works properly:

      /*  Establish viewport to be upper-left quarter of client area */ 

      GetClientRect(hWnd, (LPRECT) &CRect);
      SetViewportOrg(hDC, 0, 0);
      SetViewportExt(hDC, (CRect.right - CRect.left) / 2, \ 

                         (CRect.bottom - CRect.top) / 2);

      /*  Set Window Origin and Extent such that total logical */ 
      /*     coordinate system will cover entire client area   */ 

      SetWindowOrg(hDC, -32767, -32767);
      SetWindowExt(hDC, 32767, 32767);

Additional query words: mapping modes anisotropic isotropic
