The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
 - Microsoft Windows 95

SUMMARY
=======

In MS-DOS, hard disk and floppy disk root directories are limited in size,
depending on the media type involved. However, subdirectories can contain as
many files as disk space allows.

The subdirectories are not fixed in size and can allocate new data clusters to
hold additional directory entries. Thus, subdirectories can grow dynamically as
long as there are data clusters available to hold new file and subdirectory
entries. However, the root directory can hold only a certain number of
subdirectory entries because it is fixed in size.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following table shows the number of root directory entries for common floppy
and hard disk types:

   Single-sided 5.25-inch 180K floppy disks: 64
   Double-sided 5.25-inch 320K floppy disks: 64
   Double-sided 5.25-inch 360K floppy disks: 112
   Double-sided 3.5-inch 720K floppy disks: 112
   Double-sided 5.25-inch 1.2-megabyte floppy disks: 224
   Double-sided 3.5-inch 1.44-megabyte floppy disks: 224
   Hard disks (12- and 16-bit FATs): 512
   Iomega Zip disks (100 MB): 260

MS-DOS version 3.3 added the following:

   Double-sided 3.5-inch 1.44-megabyte floppy disks

MS-DOS version 5.0 added the following:

   Double-sided 3.5-inch 2.88-megabyte floppy disks: 240

Windows 95 added the following:

   Long filename support. Root directory entries have the same limitations in
   Windows 95 as they do in previous versions of MS-DOS. If long filename
   support is enabled, then each file can use more than one directory entry
   (depending on the length of the filename, its case, and the characters it
   uses). Therefore, it is possible to run out of root directory entries with
   fewer than 512 files in the root directory of a hard disk, and fewer than the
   numbers specified above for floppy disks.

   For more information about long filenames and Windows 95, query on the
   following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
