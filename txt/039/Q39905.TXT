 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You cannot import bitmap images into Micrografx Draw from any Microsoft Windows
application because Draw does not recognize standard bitmapped images. Draw
requires its own bitmap format.

You can, however, incorporate Draw graphics into Windows applications by cutting
and pasting from the Windows Clipboard.
