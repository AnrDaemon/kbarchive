======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network version 6.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You install MSN Explorer 6.1 on a computer with one of the following operating
systems: Windows 98, Windows 2000, or Windows Millennium Edition. You set up MSN
Explorer to dial up using an MSN Internet Access account. You upgrade the
computer to Windows XP. You create multiple profiles in Windows XP. With the
first profile created in Windows XP, you do a Fast User Switch to another
profile in Windows XP. The dial-up connection is terminated.

CAUSE
=====

This is a known issue. This does not occur if the dial-up connection is
established with profiles other than the first one you created when you
installed Windows XP.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue

1. Sign in to Windows XP with the primary profile (the first profile created
   during installation).

2. Click Start, and then click My Computer.

3. In the My Computer window, double-click the Control Panel icon.

4. Double-click the Network Connections icon.

5. Right-click the MSN Explorer connection, and then click Delete.
   Note: You can also select the MSN Explorer connection, click File, and then
   click Delete).
   A box appears asking you if you are "sure you want to delete MSN Explorer".

6. Click Yes.
   Note: This does not delete the MSN Explorer program. This only deletes the
   dial-up connection associated with the MSN Explorer program.

7. Close the Network Connections window by clicking the X in the upper-right
   corner.

8. Start MSN Explorer and sign in.
   The connectoid (dial-up connection) for MSN Explorer will be recreated with
   all of its previous settings. Now the dial-up connection will remain active
   after you switch to other profiles in Windows XP from the primary profile.
