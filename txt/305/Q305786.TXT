SUMMARY
=======

This article explains differences between the LogoTag and LogoTag2 methods.

MORE INFORMATION
================

LogoTag is used in legacy Passport Manager installations (1.36 and earlier).
When you implement LogoTag, Passport Manager displays the sign-in scarab that
has a link to the Passport Login server URL.

When you implement LogoTag2, Passport Manager displays the sign-in scarab, with a
link to the originating partner page (instead of the Passport Login server).
This is used to invoke the Tweener Login dialog box on the client side in case
the user is using a Tweener-enabled client, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer
6.0 or Microsoft Windows XP. If the user is not using a Tweener-enabled client,
the client redirects to the traditional Login server, and everything happens as
in the LogoTag case.
