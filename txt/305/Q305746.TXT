The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional

SYMPTOMS
========

DCOM activation for Active Template Library (ATL)-built COM servers may fail
with the following error message:

   0x80070005 (E_ACCESSDENIED)

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if there is a short-file-name versus long-file-name
conflict in the registry.

COM servers are registered under the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AppID key in a named value
that indicates the module name (such as OUROLEAPP.EXE). This type of named value
is REG_SZ, and it contains the string representation of the AppID associated
with the executable. This mapping is used to obtain the default access
permissions and authentication level. An ATL server with a long file name is
registered under the CLSID\LocalServer32 key with a short file name
(OUROLE~1.EXE). However, when the Dcomcnfg utility creates the mapped executable
name for the server in the registry that points to the actual AppID key of the
server, it uses the long file name (OUROLEAPP.EXE).

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, use either of the following methods:

 - Add an additional key, HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AppID\OUROLE~1.EXE, that maps to the
   same AppID as HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AppID\OUROLEAPP.EXE.

   This is the preferred method.

   -or-

 - Rename the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AppID\OUROLEAPP.EXE as
   "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AppID\OUROLE~1.EXE" (without the quotation marks).

NOTE: Use project names that are eight characters or less when you create
ATL-built COM servers.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
