======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4

SYMPTOMS
========

A Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) connection that is configured with
Allowed Directions set to Incoming may log the following event message and fail
to connect to the host system:

   Event ID: 182
   Source: SNA SDLC Link Service
   Description: Connection failure, code = 11
   Cause Data = 3601 3401 3302 f035
   Link Role = 02
   Remote Node Type = 03

The connection failure code in the Event 182 message indicates a Data Set Ready
(DSR) failure.

The other symptom associated with this problem is that the SDLC Link Service
sends a NULL Exchange Identifier (XID) to the host system when the SDLC
connection is activated. This should not occur when the SDLC connection is
configured as an incoming connection.

The following Microsoft Knowledge Base article describes a similar problem that
existed for X.25 connections:

   Q180706 Incoming X.25 Host Connection Indicates Primary Link Role

CAUSE
=====

The link role (that is, primary, secondary, or negotiable) is incorrectly set to
negotiable in the internal link data record for an incoming SDLC connection. The
internal link data record is written when the SNA configuration file (Com.cfg)
is saved after the connection is created or modified.

A link role of negotiable causes the SDLC link service to send an initial NULL
XID to the remote system when the connection is activated. The correct link role
for an incoming SDLC connection is secondary.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 4.0

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next SNA Server version 4.0 that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version
3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0
SP4.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Host Integration Server
2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Once the updated Snacfg.dll file has been applied, the SNA Server Manager
program must be run and the configuration file must be resaved after you make a
configuration file change. In this case, the easiest change to make is to change
the SDLC connection's "Allowed Directions" value from "Incoming" to "Outgoing"
and back to "Incoming".

Host connections can be configured with one of the following Allowed Directions
settings in SNA Manager:

 - Outgoing

 - Incoming

 - Both Directions

If Outgoing is selected, SNA Server or Host Integration Server (HIS) 2000
initiate the link-level (that is, SDLC or DLC) connection to the remote system.
If the remote system attempts to initiate the connection, SNA Server or HIS 2000
does not accept the connection attempt.

If Incoming is selected, SNA Server or HIS 2000 do not attempt to initiate the
link-level connection. In this case, the connection is not activated until the
remote system initiates the link-level connection. In this case, an initial XID
is not sent by SNA Server or HIS 2000.

If Both Directions is selected, SNA Server or HIS 2000 can initiate the
link-level connection and accept incoming connection activation requests from
the remote system.
