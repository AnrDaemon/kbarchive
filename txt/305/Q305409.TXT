MORE INFORMATION

Page 26: Change ISO to OSI
--------------------------

Change the first sentence on page 26 from:

of the International Standards Organization (ISO) model."

To:
"Your TCP/IP network protocol design focuses on the transport and network layers
of the Open-systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model."


Page 30: Change "Internet Domain" to "Interdomain"
--------------------------------------------------

On page 30, in the 5th bulleted item, change the text from:
"Determine the influence of Classless Internet Domain Routing (CIDR) on
networking services designs"

To:
"Determine the influence of Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR) on networking
services designs"


Page 40: Incorrect Subnet ID In Figure 2.11
-------------------------------------------

On page40, in Figure 2.11, in "Subnet Mask", change the third octet from "255" to
"240".


Page 46: Bits Should Be Bytes
-----------------------------

On page 46, in the first bulleted item,

Change:
"... rather than the first three bits of the IP address..."

To:
"... rather than the first three bytes of the IP address..."


Page 46: 25-bit Should Be 24-bit
--------------------------------

On page 46, in the first bulleted paragraph, change:

"25-bit"

To:
"24-bit"


Page 55: Incorrect IPSec Policy Assignment Target
-------------------------------------------------

On page 55, under "Applying the Decision", user accounts and group accounts are
listed as possible targets for IPSec policy assignement. This is incorrect.
Please remove the two bullets:

"User accounts

Group Accounts"


Page 177: Routers Should Be Segments
------------------------------------

On page 177, in the third bullet,

Change:
"between Routers A, B, and C"

To:
"between Segments A, B, and C"


Page 370: DHCP Relay Agent Should Be DHCP Server Service
--------------------------------------------------------

On page 370, in the third paragraph,

Change:
"DHCP Relay Agent"

To:
"DHCP Server service"


Page 375: Corrections To Table 8.1
----------------------------------

in the Server B row, change "Server C" to "Server B";

in the Printer A row, change "Printer C to "Printer A";

and in the last two rows, change "DHPC" to "DHCP".


Page 376: Correction To Screened Subnet Segments
------------------------------------------------

On page 376, in the last bulleted paragraph, replace the paragraph with:

"Screened subnet segments

Screened subnet segments (otherwise known as DMZs) exist between an
organization's private network and the Internet. The resources in these screened
subnets are accessed by unauthorized users. For security reasons, don't place
DHCP servers in these screened subnets or respond to DHCP requests from Internet
users."


Page 415: Second Router 1 Should Be Router 2
--------------------------------------------

On page 415, in the worksheet, change the second "router 1" to "router 2".


Page 441: Incorrect Text in Diagram 9.6
---------------------------------------

The right side of figure 9.6 on page 440 has the incorrect namespace in the
domain parent's box. The box currently reads "contoso.msft."

This should be changed to read "contoso-i.msft." to reflect the text and caption
comments for this diagram.

On page 572, change the 2nd heading on the page from:
"Determining the Placement of Remote Access Servers"

To:
"Determining the Number of Remote Access Servers"

"To ensure that the representatives can access the data, you can:

Add additional routers to provide redundant route paths in the event of a router
failure

Add additional connections between critical segments to provide redundant route
paths if a network segment becomes unavailable

Distribute the network traffic between the additional routers and connections, to
improve the response time of the Web-based applications."
