TITLE   :SMS: Cannot Create Collection Based on Direct Rule Membership
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200preSP4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server (SMS) collections that are based on Direct Membership
rules may lose their members or membership rules during the creation process if
the SMS permissions that are assigned are based on global groups. This problem
occurs only if the SMS provider and Microsoft SQL Server are installed on a
separate member server from the SMS site server.

This problem occurs when you are creating a new collection by using the Direct
Membership Rule Wizard (after you browse an existing collection and select the
resources that are required for the new collection). If you click Apply in the
final wizard dialog box, the collection members are lost. If you click OK in the
final wizard dialog box, the collection members and the membership rules are
lost.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the SMS provider tries to use the local
SMSServer_sitecode account to validate permissions.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
