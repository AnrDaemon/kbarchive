======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When sending e-mail messages from Visual FoxPro applications, programmers
usually use CREATEOBJECT("MAPI.Session"). Under some circumstances, however,
this may return the following error messages:

   Class definition MAPI.SESSION is not found

   -or-

   OLE error code: 0x8007007e Specified module cannot be found.

CAUSE
=====

The most likely cause of these errors is that the Collaboration Data Objects
(CDO) library is not installed. Although CDO ships with Microsoft Outlook 98 and
later, it is not installed by default.

Another possible cause is that Outlook is installed in Internet Mail Only (IMO)
mode. MAPI and CDO are not supported in this mode.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you already have Outlook 98 or later installed, and Outlook is not installed
in IMO mode, you can install the CDO library by rerunning the Outlook setup
program and explicitly including CDO. If installing Outlook is not possible, see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q171440 INFO: Where to Acquire the CDO Libraries (all versions)

If the CDO libraries are already installed and are not working, try using
RegSvr32 to reregister them. For example, the following command line would work
on Microsoft Windows 2000:

   "RegSvr32 c:\WINNT\system32\cdonts.dll" (without the quotation marks)

If this fails, contact Microsoft for further support.
