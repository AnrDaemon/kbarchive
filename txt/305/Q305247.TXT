OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOOP kbvfp kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbCodeSnippet kbvfp700fix kbvfp700

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a class with a property named "Value", attempts to change this
property to =NULL cause the following error:

   Fatal error: Exception code = C00000FD

The error does not occur if you type .NULL. instead of =NULL (or =null). Note
that "Value" is a reserved word in Visual FoxPro, and that naming a property or
method after a reserved word is not recommended.

STATUS
======

This problem was corrected in Visual FoxPro version 7.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create and then run a program containing the following code:

   DELETE FILE testxx.vc?
   _CLIPTEXT = "value"
   KEYBOARD '{alt+c}{p}{ctrl+v}{alt+a}{alt+c}{ctrl+s}{alt+f}{c}'
   MODIFY CLASS test AS CUSTOM OF testxx
   MODIFY CLASS test AS CUSTOM OF testxx NOWAIT

2. In the Property sheet of the class, locate the Value property created in the
   program from step 1.

3. Change the value of the Value property from .F. to =NULL and press the UP
   ARROW key. A memory error appears and the program closes.
