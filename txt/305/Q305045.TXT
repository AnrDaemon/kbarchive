TITLE   :PRB: Messagebox() or Inputbox() Fails to Time Out
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro

KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp500a kbvfp600 kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbCodeSnippet kbvfp500xSearch kbvfp700

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A MessageBox() or InputBox() function with a timeout parameter less than one
millisecond may never time out.

CAUSE
=====

Because both functions use milliseconds as their timeout parameter, any number
that is less than one is treated as a zero. For example, using 0.5 as the
timeout parameter causes InputBox or MessageBox to display indefinitely because
the value is treated as a zero.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use a timeout parameter that is greater than or equal to one.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To reproduce the behavior, type either of these lines in the Command window:

   =INPUTBOX("Hello world","Hey there! ","",0.5)
   =MESSAGEBOX("Hello world", 0, "", 0.5)

Note that neither window times out; both windows remain on the screen
indefinitely.
