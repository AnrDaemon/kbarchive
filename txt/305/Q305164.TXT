======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3, 2.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 clients that are configured to use NetBIOS
for remote control (instead of TCP/IP) may not be found when you try a remote
control session from an SMS Administrator console. You receive a "Remote Control
Agent not found" error message when you try a remote control session. If you run
the "netstat -a" command on the target client, you see that Wuser32 is
registered by using an uppercase NetBIOS name. If you view a Network Monitor
capture from the Administrator console, you see that the Remote.exe process is
trying to contact the Remote Control agent by using a lowercase NetBIOS name.
This causes the Administrator console not to be able to connect to the client.

CAUSE
=====

The NetBIOS name that is stored in the SMS database for the client uses
lowercase letters. The problem occurs if the site server uses only network
discovery and if Domain Name System (DNS) is being used for name resolution.
When network discovery creates the discovery record for a computer, the name is
recorded in lowercase letters. Network discovery obtains the lowercase entry
from DNS, which can store information in lowercase letters.

You can also confirm that the client's resource information is in lowercase
letters by starting the SMS Administrator console, expanding Collections,
expanding All Systems (or any collection in which this computer name appears),
and then locating the client. If the client is listed in lowercase letters, the
problem may occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

   Date       Time   Version         Size     File name   Platform
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
   01-Mar-01  15:00  2.00.1493.3212   78,944  Remote.exe  I386
   01-Mar-01  15:00  2.00.1493.3212  127,760  Remote.exe  Alpha

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that
contains these files may also contain additional files.



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

 - Configure the site to use TCP/IP as the default remote access protocol.

 - Use Remote.exe at a command prompt to manually change the NetBIOS name to
   uppercase letters. For example, type "Remote 3 SERVER1" (without the
   quotation marks).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
the Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4 Hotfix Rollup Package (HRP).
