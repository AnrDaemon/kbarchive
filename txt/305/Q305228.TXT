KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbenv kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP6a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 SP6a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply the Windows NT 4.0 Security Rollup Package (SRP) and restart a
computer that has one of the following Compaq Smart Array controllers, you may
receive an error message on a blue screen:

 - Compaq SMART Array controller
 - Compaq SMART-2/E Array controller
 - Compaq SMART-2/P Array controller
 - Compaq SMART-2DH Array controller
 - Compaq SMART-2SL Array controller
 - Compaq Smart Array 3200 controller
 - Compaq Smart Array 3100ES controller
 - Compaq Smart Array 221 controller

This is the error message that you may receive:

   STOP 0x0000000A (0xfcc35000, 0xa, 0x00000001, 0x801e092a)
   IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL

In this error message, the memory that is referenced is 0xfcc35000. The IRQL is
0xa (IRQ 10). Value 0 is a read operation; 1 is a write operation. The address
that referenced memory is 0x801e092a.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT 4.0 SRP exposes an issue with versions earlier than 4.24.0.0 of
the Compaq Array Controller device driver (Cpqarray.sys) that is available from
any of the following sources:

 - Compaq Web site: Compaq Server Support (SSD) for Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
 - Compaq SmartStart and Support Software CD-ROM
 - Compaq SmartStart for Servers

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, obtain the updated version of the Cpqarray.sys driver
from the following Compaq Web site:

   ftp://ftp.compaq.com/pub/products/servers/supportsoftware/cp001001-001500/cp001095.exe

The third-party contact information included in this article is provided to help
you find the technical support you need. This contact information is subject to
change without notice. Microsoft in no way guarantees the accuracy of this
third-party contact information.

To prevent this problem from occurring, install the updated Cpqarray.sys driver
before you install the SRP.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you cannot obtain the updated Cpqarray.sys driver that is described earlier
in this article, you can work around this issue by replacing the existing
Cpqarray.sys file with the version from Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6a
(SP6a):

1. If the partition uses the NTFS file system, install Windows NT in a different
   folder so that the files in the partition are accessible.

   If the partition uses the FAT file system, start the computer by using an
   MS-DOS boot disk, and then skip to step 3.

2. Boot the computer to the new installation of Windows NT.

3. Copy the Cpqarray.sys file from Windows NT 4.0 SP6a to the original Windows
   NT 4.0 folder (%SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers).

4. You may also use the Recovery Console from Windows 2000 to rename the
   offending driver and replace it with CPQARRAY.SYS from SP6a.


As an alternative, you can use the Scsiport.sys file from Windows NT 4.0 SP6a to
start your computer. This causes several fixes that are included with the
Windows NT 4.0 Security Rollup Package to be removed. The advantage to using
this method is that any additional functionality that is included in the Compaq
version of the Cpqarray.sys driver is available. To replace the Scsiport.sys
file, use the preceding steps, but copy the Scsiport.sys file instead of the
Cpqarray.sys file.
