SUMMARY
=======

Step by Step Interactive SQL Server database fails to install on a seperate SQL
server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs when installing Step By Step Interactive Training software
on an IIS Server with no SQL Server installed.

Steps to correct:
1) Install a network build, but when setup asks you to setup SQL (step 3) Answer
NO.
2) Step by Step Interactive install completes.
3) Copy OSQL.EXE [need to Identify where to get it - see below] to the folder
where the SQL scripts are. Default path is: c:\program files\MIT
Admin\Database\Setup.
4) Run SETUP.EXE from the SQL folder. This installs the SQL database. Setup is
now complete.

Where to get OSQL.EXE:
http://www.microsoft.com/SQL/techinfo/development/2000/MSDE2000.asp
