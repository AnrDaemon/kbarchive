TITLE   :Retried COM Function Calls Using IMessageFilter May Cause a Leak
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An event handle leak and a memory leak may occur when you are using
IMessageFilter to handle incoming COM calls. Use the hotfix that is described in
this article only if all of the following conditions exist:

 - The client implements IMessageFilter and SERVERCALL_RETRYLATER is returned in
   the implemented IMessageFilter::HandleInComingCall function.

 - The IMessageFilter::HandleInComing call in the client is called as a result
   of the COM layer synchronizing calls because of cross-apartment
   communication. An example of this is a single-threaded apartment (STA) client
   process calling out a multiple-threaded apartment (MTA) COM server process
   and the MTA COM server process calling back into the STA client process

 - The client that implements IMessageFilter is running on Windows NT 4.0. If
   the client is running on Microsoft Windows 2000, the leak does not occur.

 - The client process has a visible handle leak that you can observe by using a
   process-monitoring tool such as Windows Task Manager.

 - The client process has a visible memory leak that you can observe by using a
   process-monitoring tool such as Windows Task Manager.

CAUSE
=====

This issue is caused by a problem in the COM run-time in Windows NT 4.0.
