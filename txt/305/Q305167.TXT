SYMPTOMS
========

During troubleshooting it's determined that your MSN connectivity problem is
related to either modem initialization strings or to the need for a
reinstallation of your modem drivers.

RESOLUTION
==========

MSN Technical Support handles troubleshooting initialization strings (a string
of characters sent to a modem that configure the modem and prepare it for use)
and general modem settings (speed, volume, flow control).

When and if we determine that the solution to your connectivity issue is to
reinstall the modem driver, a Support Technician will refer you back to your OEM
(Original Equipment Manufacturer). As an additional resource, visit one of the
