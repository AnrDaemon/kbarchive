SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT 4.0 Performance Monitor (Perfmon4.exe) Help states that the Processor
- %DPC Time is "a component of % Privileged Time because DPCs are executed in
privileged mode. They are counted separately and are not a component of the
interrupt counters." This implies that the %Privilege Time does not include %DPC
Time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Performance Monitor Processor Counter explanation may be difficult to
interpret. Note that %DPC time is included with %Privileged Time and is also
counted separately. The is also true for %Interrupt Time. %Processor Time equals
%User time plus %Privileged Time.
