SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Microsoft game, the screen may change to black, and then the
computer may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if your computer's video card acceleration settings are
incorrect.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, click Run, type "win.ini" (without the quotation marks) in the
   Open box, and then click OK.

2. In the [windows] section, type a single semicolon (;) in front of the
   SafeMode=1 line.

3. On the File menu, click Save.

4. On the File menu, click Exit.

5. Restart the computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Another symptom of this behavior occurs when you start Dxdiag.exe, and then
click the Display tab: All of the options for DirectDraw, Direct3D, and AGP are
unavailable, and you are unable to perform the tests for these features. This
usually indicates that the Hardware Acceleration setting is set to Basic or
None. However, when you check this setting in the display options, Hardware
Acceleration is set to Full.
