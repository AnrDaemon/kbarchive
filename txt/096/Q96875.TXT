KEYWORDS:

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft does not support retrieving and comparing data created with Norton
Backup.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Backup uses Microsoft DoubleSpace compression technology developed
specifically for MS-DOS 6.0. This compression engine replaces the compression
engine technology in Norton Backup, making the two backup sets incompatible.

Microsoft Backup complies with the Microsoft Real Time Compression Interface
(MRCI), which allows it (without further modification) to use a hardware
implementation of the DoubleSpace compression server (if one is present).

Although it is possible to create backups without compression, Microsoft does not
support exchanging backup sets with the Norton Backup program.
