Q. Can AutoCad work with LAN Manager?

A. AutoCad works fine with LAN Manager if the AutoCad overlay files

   are on the workstation (local). AutoCad's overlay loading procedure somehow
   does not work with LAN Manager, and the result is that the workstation tries
   to load the overlays off the wrong network drive. For instance, the overlay
   files are on drive X, but the workstation tries to load from L, then issues
   an "unable to locate ..." error message. This does not happen if the overlays
   are local.
