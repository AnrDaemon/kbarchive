TITLE   :PC WRmt: Message Header Listing Incorrect
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, some mail items are marked
as unread after they are downloaded even though it appears that the messages
should be marked as read.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Mail does not mark an item as read until it is
successfully downloaded to the remote client. The External Mail program
(EXTERNAL.EXE) does not mark an item as successfully downloaded until the
connection closes.

RESOLUTION
==========

This behavior is part of the design of EXTERNAL.EXE.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The External Mail program builds the header list before it downloads message
items. It would be very difficult to build the header list after Mail downloads
the last header item.

The message number on the client is different from the message number on the
postoffice. Therefore, Mail cannot compare message numbers to determine which
messages have been read. One possible method would be to compare the user ID and
the message subject. However, this method is ineffective because more than one
message can have the same user ID and message subject (for example, an exchange
of messages about a subject). Therefore, there is no easy method to track read
messages other than tracking downloaded messages.
