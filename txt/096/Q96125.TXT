TITLE   :3COM: Conversion to Mail 3.0 Windows Client Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to use the Conversion Utility from 3Com 3+Mail for Microsoft Mail for
PC Networks version 3.0 with Microsoft Mail for Windows version 3.0 does not
work properly. Messages are missing and folders are incomplete.

CAUSE
=====

The Conversion Utility was written for version 2.1 of the Microsoft Mail
database architecture. It does not place the folders into the Windows client
Mail Message File (.MMF).

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the MS-DOS client to determine if the folders have been converted. The
Conversion Utility can convert the folders correctly but has not placed the
folders into the Windows client .MMF file.

If this is the case, use the Windows-based CONVERT.EXE program, provided with
Microsoft Mail version 3.0, to convert the MS-DOS client folders into Windows
folders.

After you run CONVERT.EXE, if the folders do not appear in the Windows client,
perform the following five steps to regenerate the folders in the MS-DOS
client:

1. Archive the folders

2. Delete the folders

3. Recreate the folders

4. Restore the archive

5. Use the CONVERT.EXE program to move the folders into the .MMF file
