SUMMARY
=======

When Microsoft Undelete is using the Delete Sentry level of protection, files
that are deleted are stored in a hidden SENTRY directory in the root of the
drive. These files are automatically purged from the drive under the following
conditions:

 - MS-DOS requires the disk space. For example, if the drive is full and you are
   saving updates to a data file, enough files are removed from the hidden
   SENTRY directory so that you can save your data.

 - Files in the hidden SENTRY directory are taking up too much space on the
   drive. By default, Delete Sentry allows files to take a maximum of 20% of
   total the drive space.

 - Files in the hidden SENTRY directory are too old. By default, files are saved
   for seven days. Purging of old files occurs when Microsoft Undelete is loaded
   (typically from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file).

In each case, files are purged in chronological order (oldest first).

MORE INFORMATION

You can adjust the maximum amount of disk space allowed for deleted files or the

      example:
