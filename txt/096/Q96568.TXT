SUMMARY
=======

To use Microsoft SQL Server on a Novell NetWare network with Microsoft Windows
for Workgroups clients, SQL Server 4.2b is required. This product contains the
Microsoft Network Integration Kit that allows SQL Server DB- Library clients
(MS-DOS, OS/2, or Windows) and ODBC clients to connect to SQL Server using
native SPX connections over NetWare, as opposed to using the Novell named-pipe
implementation.


The Novell OS/2 requester client software (DOSNP.EXE), a terminate-
and-stay-resident (TSR) program that allows use of named pipes with IPX.COM, is
no longer required to connect to SQL servers on Novell NetWare networks.
