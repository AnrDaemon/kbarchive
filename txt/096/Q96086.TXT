You can install both the Microsoft HP DeskJet universal printer driver and the HP
DeskJet series version 5.x printer driver in Windows at the same time, but one
of the printer drivers can be active. You can switch between the printer drivers
as needed in Control Panel and in some applications.

You cannot install both the HP DeskJet series version 3.11 and version 5.x
printer drivers in Windows. If you install a version 5.x printer driver over an
existing version 3.11 (or older) printer driver, the version 3.11 (or older)
printer driver files will be overwritten and the version 5.x printer driver will
become the active driver.

To determine which printer driver and version you are using, follow these steps.
