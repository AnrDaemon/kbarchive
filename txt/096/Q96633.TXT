======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The MS-DOS 6.0 OEM Setup program copies all supplied files by default; this
includes the optional Windows-based utilities Backup, Undelete, and Anti-Virus.
These components are copied to your hard disk whether or not Windows is
installed on your system.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The files for the Windows-based utilities are copied to your hard disk; however,
they are not set up correctly if Windows is not installed at the time of the
initial setup. If you later add Windows to your system, running SETUP /E will
properly configure the Windows-based utilities.
