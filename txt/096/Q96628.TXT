The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22

SYMPTOMS
========

Some older CGA display adapters don't properly handle the scrolling of text. If
you are using on of these cards, the DIR and MEM command /P parameter may not
function correctly.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, add a device statement for ANSI.SYS with the /S
parameter to the CONFIG.SYS file as in the following example:

   device=c:\dos\ansi.sys /s
