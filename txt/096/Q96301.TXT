To create a multiple-page format file, do the following:

1. To create a multiple-page input form, first design two separate screens.

2. Generate the screens.

3. Open the resulting .FMT format files. (From the File menu, choose Open, and
   then choose the Program button.)

4. After both format files are open, activate the screen that represents page 2.
   From the Edit menu, choose Select All to select all the program code, and
   then choose Copy from the Edit menu.

5. Activate the screen that represents page 1. Select the line after the last
   line of code in the generated screen. Type "READ" (without the quotation
   marks) and then press ENTER. From the Edit menu, choose Paste.

To move between the pages, press the PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys.
