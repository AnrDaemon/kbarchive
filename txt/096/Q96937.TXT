TITLE   :UNINSTALL and DELOLDOS Don't Remove Directories
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.21,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use a directory name other than the default directory name for MS-DOS
(C:\DOS), the commands UNINSTALL and DELOLDOS may have difficulty finding and
removing the appropriate directories. Also, MS-DOS Setup may not put your
previous MS-DOS files in the appropriate OLD_DOS.<X> directory (where
<X> is a number based on the number of OLD_DOS directories that have not
been removed).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS version 6.0, 6.2, and
6.21. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you run DELOLDOS, the OLD_DOS.1 directory is removed; however, the MSDOS5
directory, which contains all the old MS-DOS files, is not. Your directory
structure appears as follows:

   c:\msdos5 (still contains old MS-DOS files)
   c:\msdos6 (contains new MS-DOS files)

If you run UNINSTALL, OLD_DOS.1 is removed, along with all the files in MSDOS6;
however, the MSDOS6 directory is not removed. Your directory structure appears
as follows:

   c:\msdos5 (contains old MS-DOS files)
   c:\msdos6 (contains no files)

All these commands (SETUP, DELOLDOS, and UNINSTALL) correctly manage the MS-DOS
PATH variable and do not jeopardize any operating system functionality. The only
problem is in the proper removal and creation of certain directories.
