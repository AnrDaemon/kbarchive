TITLE   :PC Win: Err Msg: A TPL File Has Been Incorrectly Modified...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, you may receive
the following error message when selecting details on a user from the postoffice
address list:

   A TPL file has been incorrectly modified. Contact your Administrator.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs if the field data type entry in the ADMIN.TPL file is in
lowercase letters. The ADMIN.TPL file is an ASCII text file that can be defined
by the user. It provides additional information to be displayed when selecting
details on an address. The fields are in the following form:

   FieldPrompt:~Entry1~Entry2~Entry3~Entry4~

where Entry3 is the field data type.

The Windows client only accepts {A,L,U,N,P} for the field data type. The MS-DOS
client accepts {a,A,l,L,u,U,n,N,p,P} and works properly with any of these
values.

RESOLUTION
==========

For the template to work properly in both clients, the ADMIN.TPL field data type
entries must appear in capital letters. You can make this modification using any
text editor.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
