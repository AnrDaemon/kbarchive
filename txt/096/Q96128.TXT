The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands

SUMMARY
=======

Setup, MemMaker, and DoubleSpace need to locate the Windows directory on your
hard disk (if you have one).

MORE INFORMATION
================

To find the Windows directory, Setup looks for the following three files:

   WIN.COM
   PROGMAN.INI
   SYSTEM.INI

When you run SETUP /E to install the optional utilities, Setup checks to make
sure your DOS directory is in the path and looks for one of the following files
in that directory: DISKCOPY.COM, FORMAT.COM, or SYS.COM.

MemMaker looks for the WINVER.EXE file.

DoubleSpace looks for the following three files:

   WINVER.EXE
   SYSTEM.INI
   WINFILE.INI

Additional query words: 6.00 setup.exe busetup.exe memmaker.exe dblspace dblspace.exe 6.20
