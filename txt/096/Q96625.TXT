SUMMARY
=======

The information in this article applies to all versions of EMM386.EXE shown
below:

Product                                Version of EMM386.EXE
----------------------------------------------------------
MS-DOS 6.0                                    4.45
MS-DOS 6.2 and 6.21                           4.48
MS-DOS 6.22                                   4.49
Windows for Workgroups 3.11                   4.48

EMM386.EXE included with MS-DOS 6.x and Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version
3.11 provides support for the Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI) without
having to set an expanded memory page frame and without having to specify a VCPI
memory pool.

VCPI services are provided by default--no special switches or parameters are
required. If you want to disable VCPI support, you must use the NOVCPI switch on
the EMM386.EXE command line in the CONFIG.SYS file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Several popular MS-DOS-based applications use DOS extenders to share extended
memory and use of the protected mode of 80386 and higher processors through
VCPI. VCPI is an extension to the expanded memory services (EMS) interface and
is typically implemented by an EMS emulator (such as EMM386.EXE or Quarterdeck's
QEMM386.SYS).

Without VCPI support, "DOS-extended" applications could not run with systems
running in virtual 8086 mode. EMS emulators use virtual 8086 mode to provide
expanded memory mapping and/or create upper memory blocks (UMBs).

To enable VCPI support in the version of EMM386.EXE provided with both MS-DOS 5.0
and Windows 3.1, you must configure EMM386.EXE to emulate EMS. To enable VCPI
without EMS support when the NOEMS switch is active, you must specify a VCPI
memory pool size. For example, if you are using the version of EMM386.EXE from
MS-DOS 5.0 or Windows 3.1, you can use the following command to provide 1
megabyte of VCPI memory:

   DEVICE=EMM386.EXE 1024 NOEMS

The MS-DOS 6.x and Windows for Workgroups version of EMM386.EXE enables VCPI
support without specifying a VCPI size parameter even if the NOEMS switch is
active. Any EMM386 device command that does not include the NOVCPI switch
provides VCPI services.

With EMM386.EXE, VCPI memory is sized using the same parameters as the EMS pool
size (EMM386 [memory] and MIN= parameters).
