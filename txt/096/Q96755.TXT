TITLE   :Compaq LTE Hibernation Mode Incompatible with DoubleSpace
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

Compaq LTE machines have an option called "hibernation mode." This option writes
all information in memory to drive C and then turns the power off to conserve
battery power. When you turn on the computer on again, it automatically loads
the information back into memory, rather than restarting MS-DOS.

If you have compressed drive C with DoubleSpace, the hibernation mode information
is inaccessible when you restart the computer.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs because the DoubleSpace drivers are not loaded when the computer
tries to read in the information from the hibernation file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around to this problem, disable the Compaq hibernation mode if your
drive C is compressed. For information on disabling this feature, refer to your
Compaq documentation.
