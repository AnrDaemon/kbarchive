======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message occurs when MS-DOS 6.x Upgrade has not been
successfully installed:

   The MS-DOS Setup was not completed Insert the UNINSTALL #1 diskette in drive
   A
   Press the ENTER key to continue

CAUSE
=====

If you cannot recover from this situation by restarting your computer with the
Uninstall disk in drive A, your CMOS settings may be configured to search drive
C for the MS-DOS system files.

Traditionally, the computer BIOS attempts to start MS-DOS from drive A and then
searches drive C if no disk is in drive A. However, some newer AMI BIOS chips
allow you to start your computer from drive C without first looking to drive A.
This is incompatible with the MS-DOS 5 and later upgrade uninstall technology.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, modify your CMOS settings to check for a boot disk
in drive A before attempting to boot from drive C.
