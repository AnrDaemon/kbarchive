PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

The short tear-off feature does not work on Epson 9-pin printers if you set a
user-defined paper size. This problem occurs with any application that prints
from Windows version 3.1 using the EPSON9.DRV printer driver.

CAUSE
=====

This feature does not work because the Epson 9-pin printers wait for a formfeed
(FF) character to signal the end of a print job. For user- defined paper sizes,
the printer driver does not send an FF character at the end of print jobs.
Instead, the driver uses vertical positioning to determine the actual length of
the paper and feeds the paper based on that length.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, the short tear-off feature does not work when you print checks from
Microsoft Money on the Epson LX-810 because the check blanks require a
user-defined paper size.

This problem occurs with the EPSON9.DRV printer driver supplied with Windows
version 3.1 and with version 2.21 of the driver.
