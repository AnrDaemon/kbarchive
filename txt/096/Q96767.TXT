The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how you can use the SETVER command to add an MS-DOS-based
application to the version table so that you can run it successfully under
MS-DOS 5.0 and later.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some applications check which version of Microsoft MS-DOS is running when you
start them. Such applications may not run if you are using a version of MS-DOS
that the application was not designed for. For example, an application designed
for MS-DOS version 3.30 may not start if you are running MS-DOS version 6.0;
instead, the application may display a message similar to the following:

   Incorrect DOS version

This message indicates that one of the following problems exists:

 - The application is incompatible with your version of MS-DOS.

 - The application is compatible; however, the application cannot run because it
   interprets the MS-DOS version as incompatible.

Contact the manufacturer of your application to determine whether it is
compatible with MS-DOS versions 5.0, 6.0, or 6.2. If it is incompatible with
these versions, you need to obtain an updated version of the application.

When to Use SETVER
------------------

If the application is actually compatible but interprets your version of MS-DOS
as incompatible, you may be able to work around this problem by adding the
application to the version table. The version table is a list of applications
that need MS-DOS to report a version number other than 5.0, 6.0, or 6.2. MS-DOS
maintains the version table in a file called SETVER.EXE, which is in your DOS
directory.

Installing SETVER.EXE
---------------------

To use SETVER, you must also have the "DEVICE=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE" command in your
CONFIG.SYS file. This command installs the SETVER.EXE file, which contains the
version table, each time you start your computer. Usually, Setup adds this
command for you when you install MS-DOS version 5.0, 6.0, or 6.2 on your
computer.

If "DEVICE=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE" is not in your CONFIG.SYS file, use a text editor
to add it.

You must restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL for the change to take
effect.

NOTE: Make sure you have only one SETVER.EXE file on your hard disk drive. Each
SETVER.EXE file contains a unique version table. If you have multiple version
tables, SETVER may not report the correct version number to an application.

To display the complete list of applications in the version table, type "setver"
(without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt. The setup programs
for MS-DOS 5 Upgrade and MS-DOS 6 Upgrade add several programs and device
drivers to the version table; therefore, even if you don't add any programs to
the version table yourself, you will see a list of applications when you type
the command.

Adding an Application to the Version Table
------------------------------------------

To add an application to the version table, use the SETVER command. The syntax of
the SETVER command is as follows:

   setver <filename> <n.nn>

where <filename> is the name of the application file, including its
extension (you do not need to specify the location of the application file), and
<n.nn> is the version number you want MS-DOS to report. Specify the
version number of your previous version of MS-DOS. For example, if your previous
version of MS-DOS was 3.20, specify 3.20 on the SETVER command line.

NOTE: You must restart your system by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL for the change to
take effect.

Suppose you have an application called EASYEDIT.EXE that requires MS-DOS to
report version 3.30. To work around this version number problem, type the
following command at the MS-DOS command prompt to add EASYEDIT.EXE to the
version table:

   " setver easyedit.exe 3.30" (without the quotation marks)

Removing an Application from the Version Table
----------------------------------------------

If you install an updated version of the application, you may need to remove its
entry from the version table. You can do this by using the /D switch with the
SETVER command.

For example, to remove the EASYEDIT.EXE application from the version table, type
the following command:

   " setver easyedit.exe /d" (without the quotation marks)

You must restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL for this change to take
effect. Once you do, MS-DOS goes back to reporting the current version of MS-DOS
to the application.

Incompatible Applications
-------------------------

The SETVER command does not affect whether an application is actually compatible
with MS-DOS. The command works only for applications that are already compatible
with MS-DOS version 5.0, 6.0, or 6.2, and simply need to receive a different
version number when they check for the MS-DOS version at startup.

If an application is incompatible, you must obtain an updated version from the
manufacturer of the application.

CAUTION: You many want to contact your software manufacturer to determine if your
specific program works with MS-DOS 5.0, 6.0, or 6.2. Some programs rely on
outdated MS-DOS functions that may not be present in later versions of MS-DOS.
Adding an incompatible program to the version table may result in lost or
corrupt data or system instabilities. Microsoft is not responsible for any lost,
damaged, or corrupted data.
