The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your Microsoft Paintbrush image does not print in color on a Hewlett- Packard
(HP) DeskJet 550C or 560C printer when you are using the HP DeskJet printer
driver.

CAUSE
=====

The printer driver is configured for Black and Color; you must configure the
printer driver for All Color or it cannot print.

RESOLUTION
==========

To change this setting, do the following:

1. In Control Panel, choose the Printers icon.

2. From the list of installed printers, select the HP DeskJet 550C, and then
   choose the Setup button.

3. Select the All Color option, and then choose the OK button.

If this procedure fails, check your video driver. If it is not Microsoft VGA,
change it and retry. If changing the driver works, be sure to remember to change
from All Color to Black and Color when doing normal print jobs and to change
back to All Color for Paintbrush work.
