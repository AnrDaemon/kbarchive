TITLE   :How DBLSPACE.BIN Determines If It Should Stay in Memory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SUMMARY
=======

If you have DBLSPACE.BIN in the root directory of your startup drive (usually C)
but you do not have a compressed volume file (CVF), DBLSPACE.BIN still loads in
memory.

After DBLSPACE.BIN loads in memory, it searches for the DBLSPACE.INI file.

 - If DBLSPACE.INI is found, DBLSPACE.BIN remains in memory and continues the
   boot process by loading IO.SYS in memory. (It doesn't matter whether the
   DBLSPACE.INI file is valid.)

 - If the DBLSPACE.INI file is not found, DBLSPACE.BIN does not remain loaded in
   memory.

NOTE: The DBLSPACE.SYS command in the CONFIG.SYS file does not affect this
process.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you attempt to load DBLSPACE.SYS in the CONFIG.SYS file when DBLSPACE.BIN is
not loaded into memory, the following error message is displayed:

   You cannot access any DoubleSpace compressed drives because DBLSPACE.BIN is
   not loaded. (DBLSPACE.BIN is the portion of MS-DOS that provides access to
   DoubleSpace compressed drives.)

To correct this problem, remove the line in the CONFIG.SYS that loads
DBLSPACE.SYS or assure that DBLSPACE.BIN remains in memory on startup.
