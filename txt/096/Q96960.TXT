TITLE   :MS-DOS Shell Clock Does Not Update When POWER Is Running
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running POWER with MS-DOS Shell, the clock in the lower-right
corner (on the message bar) is not updated when the machine is in the power
conservation mode.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because of the design of Shell. Shell uses an internal
counter and updates the time display when this counter reaches 65535. Under
normal circumstances, the counter reaches 65535 approximately one time per
minute. When POWER is loaded, the rate at which the counter is incremented is
slowed considerably. As a result, the time display is updated approximately one
time per hour.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS Shell version 6.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
