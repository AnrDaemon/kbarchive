TITLE   :PC WRmt: Problems Regaining Control with Some Screen Savers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Mail Remote version 3.2 for Windows works as expected with the screen
saver built into Microsoft Windows version 3.1. However, Mail may not work as
expected with the IdleWild screen saver provided with the Microsoft Windows
Entertainment Pack or with other non-standard screen saver applications for
Windows.

CAUSE
=====

If some Windows screen savers become active while the Mail Remote for Windows
connection dialog box is communicating with the modem, the user may be unable to
regain control of the system until the connection dialog box has completed its
communication.

If a screen saver follows the published protocol (which IdleWild does not), Mail
Remote for Windows can process the WM_SYSCOMMAND SC_SCREENSAVE message and
return a nonzero value to prevent the screen saver from becoming active.

RESOLUTION
==========

In most screen savers, Mail Remote for Windows regains control if you press the
ENTER or ESC key or the SPACEBAR, or if you move the mouse.
