TITLE   :Bernoulli Drive Doesn't Mount with DoubleSpace Loaded
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

]This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and
filenames.

If DBLSPACE.SYS is loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file before Iomega's device driver
(RCD.SYS) then the Bernoulli mount code is discarded before the Bernoulli drives
become readable.

RCD.SYS should be loaded as high as possible in the CONFIG.SYS file and MUST be
loaded before DBLSPACE.SYS.

NOTE: DBLSPACE.SYS does not load a device driver for DoubleSpace. It simply moves
DBLSPACE.BIN in memory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem may be corrected by later version of the Iomega driver.


Contact Iomega for more information.
