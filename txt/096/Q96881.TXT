SUMMARY
=======

If the default vocabulary is missing or is corrupt, Voice Pilot generates the
following error message when it is started:

   There are one or more user (*.usr) or voice (*.vcb) data files in the
   VOICEPIL.INI that cannot be found. The Voice Pilot will resort to using the
   default file as a substitute.

You can continue using Voice Pilot, but if you try to use it with an application
that does not have a custom vocabulary, the following error message is
generated:

   Cannot support the following application because the Voice Pilot cannot find
   the default data files

This message means that the default vocabulary is missing or corrupt.

To correct he problem you need to delete, then reinstall, the default vocabulary.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To correct the problem, proceed as follows:

1. Delete the DEFAPP.VCB file from the Windows Sound System directory or from
   the location specified in the [apps] section of the VOICEPIL.INI file. (You
   can find the VOICEPIL.INI file in your Windows directory.)

2. Reinstall the DEFAPP.VCB from the Windows Sound System disks. The file is in
   compressed form (defapp.vc_) and can be found on disk 5 of the 3 1/2" or 5
   1/4" media. You can use the expansion program from Windows to expand the
   file.

Additional query words: 1.0 1.0a 2.0
