SUMMARY
=======

The DIR command has two switches that you can use to display compression ratio
information: /C and /CH.

 - /C displays the compression ratio of a file assuming that it resides on a
   drive using 8-kilobyte (K) clusters.

 - /CH uses the cluster size of the host partition.

In most cases, there is no difference between the output of these switches unless
your DoubleSpace host partition uses a cluster size other than 8 kilobytes. For
example, if you have a file on a drive using 4K clusters, the compression ratio
displayed generated from DIR /C would be 1.5; DIR /CH would generate a
compression ratio of 2.0.
