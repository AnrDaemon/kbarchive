TITLE   :VSafe Err Msg: Program Is Trying to Write to Hard Disk
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.21,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following pop-up dialog box may be displayed when you perform a disk
operation that writes to the disk:

   VSAFE Warning

   Program is trying to write to hard disk
   Do you wish to continue?

You can then choose one of three options: Stop, Continue, or Boot. If you choose
Stop, the following error message is displayed:

   ATTENTION: A serious disk error has occurred while writing to drive C.

NOTE: If you are running MS-DOS Prompt from Windows, this error message is
displayed in a blue screen with the heading "Serious Disk Error."

You can now choose to retry the operation. This causes the first VSAFE error to
be displayed again. Until you choose Continue or Boot, you are not able to
escape these recurring warning messages. If you choose Continue, the write
operation is performed. If you choose Boot, the write operation aborts, your
system restarts, and any information you were trying to save is lost.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when VSafe is installed with the write-protect option
enabled and SMARTDrive is installed with write caching enabled.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS versions 6.0, 6.2, and
6.21. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do not simultaneously use SMARTDrive configured for
write caching and VSafe configured for write protection.
