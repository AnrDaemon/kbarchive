The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta 1994 The Complete Multimedia Encyclopedia 
 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows versions 1991 edition, 1992 edition, 1993 edition 
 - Microsoft Cinemania for Windows versions 1992 edition, 1994 edition

SUMMARY
=======

If you install Encarta, Bookshelf, or Cinemania on a computer using the Tandy
Sensation shell on Windows 3.x, one of the following situations may occur.

NOTE: Other applications may also experience these problems.


1. You receive an application execution error message:

   DESKTOP caused a General Protection Fault in module TANDYRTL.DLL at
   0001:6641. GP Faults have also been caused in MSACM.DRV.

2. During setup, the Group dialog box is blank.

3. The multimedia application installs successfully, but when you attempt to
   play wave files, you receive the following error message:

   No wave device that can play files in the current format is installed. Use
   the Drivers option to install the wave device.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Tandy Sensation uses WinMate as the default shell. WinMate uses the Install
command in the File menu to run the SETUP.EXE or INSTALL.EXE file of any
application. Some applications, such as Encarta, Bookshelf, and Cinemania may
fail during setup on this configuration. To correct the problem, run SETUP.EXE
from the Windows Program Manager.

STATUS
======

Tandy Corporation has included printed addendum notes with the Sensation manual
that state that "some applications do not install properly with WinMate." These
notes provide instructions on using Windows Program Manager (which is accessible
from a button on the desktop) to install applications.

The third-party products discussed here are manufactured by vendors independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
