-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When FoxPro for Windows is started, it searches in the Windows directory
for the FOXPRO.INI file. This file contains information about the main
FoxPro window, including its position, size, and default font.

If the FOXPRO.INI file cannot be found in the Windows directory, FoxPro
will be started with the default settings.

The information in the FOXPRO.INI file is updated each time you quit
FoxPro. If the file has been removed, renamed, or deleted, a new one will
be created in the Windows directory when you quit FoxPro.

To change the contents of the FOXPRO.INI file:

1. Start FoxPro for Windows.

2. Position and size the main FoxPro window as desired.

3. Change the FoxPro desktop font to the desired font by using the MODIFY WINDOW
   SCREEN command with the FONT clause.

4. Quit FoxPro.
