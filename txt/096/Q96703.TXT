SUMMARY
=======

Using SoundBits, you can define custom events for specific applications. To do
this, insert a line in the [Sounds] section of the Win.ini file using the
following syntax:

   <Application .EXE filename><Event>=<Path to waveform
   file>,<Text to appear in SND.CPL>

For example, the following line defines a custom Open event for Microsoft
Cinemania 1995:

      [Sounds]
      cnmnia95Open=C:\Windows\Chimes.wav,Cinemania 95 Start

NOTE: The path to the program (in this case Cnmnia95.exe) must be included on the
path statement in the Autoexec.bat file. You cannot type the full path to the
.exe file in the [Sounds] section of the Win.ini file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Custom events are available for the following events:

   Open
   Close
   Minimize
   Maximize
   RestoreDown
   RestoreUp

The event name is what appears in the Sound Event dialog box and is not case
sensitive.
