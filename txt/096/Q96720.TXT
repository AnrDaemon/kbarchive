SUMMARY
=======

In version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, communications sessions
with Telebit Trailblazer modems are unsuccessful when there is not a matching
model on External.

The problem seems to be related to unrecognizable characters on the end of the
telephone number. Telebit modems are sensitive to this, other modems are not.

During testing, the DTE rate locked at 9600bps and enabled CTS/RTS flow control.
The original script was returning 0 from INITIALIZE: as soon as a modem command
returned 0. Subsequent initialization commands were being ignored.

The script was changed to allow for this condition.

Telebit modems now communicate with each other (send and receive) but do not
communicate with other modems tested.
