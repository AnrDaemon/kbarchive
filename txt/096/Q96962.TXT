SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Disney Sound Source with Microsoft Windows, you may receive one of
the following error messages if you try to print from a Windows- based
application while playing sounds through Disney Sound Source:

   Printer on LPT1: is busy

-or-

   LPT1 is being used by another application

CAUSE
=====

Disney Sound Source is a parallel device for playing waveform (.WAV) sounds and
has no MIDI capability. It uses a parallel pass-through adapter to plug into the
parallel port on a computer and can go between the parallel port and a parallel
printer cable. The above error is caused by a limitation in the hardware design
of this product.

WORKAROUND
==========

You may be able to decrease the chances of receiving this error message by
setting the printer connection to LPTx.DOS (where <x> is the number of the
parallel port) in the Printers dialog box of Control Panel.

MORE INFORMATION
================
