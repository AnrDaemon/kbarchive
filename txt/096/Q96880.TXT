The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The later versions of most third-party disk repair programs, such as Norton Disk
Doctor, should work properly with DoubleSpace-compressed drives. However,
CHKDSK.EXE (which calls DBLSPACE/CHKDSK on DoubleSpace drives) is aware of more
details about the internal workings of a compressed volume file (CVF) and can
diagnose and repair problems other software may not find.

WARNING: Before you run any third-party disk repair program on your MS-DOS 6.0
system, you should verify that the program is compatible with MS-DOS 6.0 and
with DoubleSpace-compressed drives.


MORE INFORMATION
================

In general, third-party utility software works correctly with DoubleSpace
drives. For example, Norton Disk Doctor (NDD.EXE) performs its functions exactly
as it should. However, there are problems that may occur in a DoubleSpace drive
that most third-party software cannot to detect; these problems can are best
corrected by running CHKDSK.EXE.
