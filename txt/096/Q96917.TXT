======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, an attempt to use Shared
Folders stored on the Mail server fails.

CAUSE
=====

Shared Folders are not stored on your local workstation. EXTERNAL.EXE provides
the workstation link to the postoffice; the External Mail program only sends and
receives messages. It does not support the continued online sessions to the
postoffice that would be necessary to support Shared Folders.

Additional query words: 3.20
