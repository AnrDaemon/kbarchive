SUMMARY
=======

The CHOICE command prompts you to make a choice in a batch program. It displays
a specified prompt and pauses for you to choose from among a specified set of
keys. You can only use this command in batch programs.

The CHOICE command allows only one key to be used per selection. For example, you
cannot use "12" as a key selection. CHOICE interprets this as "1" and "2";
however, you can use the ANSI character set equivalent for 12 by holding down
the ALT key and pressing the appropriate key combination on the numeric keypad.
Not all combinations work, but you can use up to 222 different entries from the
255 available. The table below details which characters work.

   Key Combination    Work?
   ---------------    -----

   0-27               No
   28-31              Yes
   32                 No
   33-255             Yes (some exceptions noted below)

MORE INFORMATION
================

ALT+37 displays the percent sign (%). If you use the percent sign in a batch
file, it acts as a replaceable parameter. You must use two percent signs (one
immediately after the other) to use the % symbol. To do this, press the ALT+37
key combination twice.

ALT+47 displays the forward slash (/). The forward slash does not work with
CHOICE.

ALT+60 displays the opening bracket (<). The opening bracket represents a
redirector and does not work with CHOICE.

ALT+62 displays the closing angle bracket (>). The closing bracket represents
a redirector and does not work with CHOICE.

ALT+124 displays the pipe character (|). The pipe represents the MS-DOS pipe and
does not work with CHOICE.

ALT+127 represents the DEL (delete) key. The DEL key does not work with the
CHOICE command.

ALT+255 represents SPACEBAR. This character works if you press ALT+255. It does
not work if you press SPACEBAR.

If you use the extended characters between 128 and 165, use the /S switch to
treat choice keys at case sensitive.
