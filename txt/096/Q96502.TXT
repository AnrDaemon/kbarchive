The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If a network name has changed in version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
and you are using schedule distribution or dynamic connections, the change must
also be propagated into versions 1.0 and 1.0a of Microsoft Schedule+ for
Windows.

To propagate the changes into Schedule+, do the following:

1. Change the network name.

2. Delete the POF file for that postoffice. To do this, delete the 00000000.POF
   file in the CAL directory of the postoffice.

   NOTE: This file is a hidden file.

3. The next time any user belonging to that postoffice makes a change to their
   calendar, a new POF file gets created. This POF file will match the new
   network name.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When using schedule distribution or dynamic connections, Schedule+ must be aware
of the complete postoffice name. If only one postoffice is using Schedule+ and
there are no plans to add additional postoffices in the future, these steps do
not need to be taken.

Additional query words: schedule plus 1.00 1.00a resync resynch re-synch
