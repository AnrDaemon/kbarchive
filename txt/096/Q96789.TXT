Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.


The C Run-time contains a function to delete one file, but does not allow a
program to delete multiple files using wildcard characters. The DELETE.C module
included with this sample can be used with any application or dynamic-link
library (DLL) to perform this operation. This module uses the
_dos_findfirst/next functions in conjunction with the remove() function to allow
multiple files to be erased.

NOTE: In the sample, if "Delete tmp Files" is selected from the menu, the two
.TMP files included with the sample will be erased.

For information on how to call the Delete() function, please refer to the comment
block inside of DELETE.C.
