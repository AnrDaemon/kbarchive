KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You receive the following error message when you attempt to mount a compressed
volume file (CVF):

   Unrecognized Error #109

CAUSE
=====

Your CVF is probably too fragmented.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, either increase the MaxFileFragments setting in the
DBLSPACE.INI file or defragment the CVF. These procedures are outlined below.

1. Edit the DBLSPACE.INI file and increase the MaxFileFragments setting by using
   the following steps:

   WARNING: If you use the incorrect drive letters when you edit the DBLSPACE.INI
   file, the system may stop responding (hang) when you restart it.

   a. Remove the Read-Only, System, and Hidden file attributes on the
      DBLSPACE.INI file. For example, if drive H is your host drive, type the
      following at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER:

   " attrib c:\dblspace.ini -r -s -h" (without the quotation marks)

   b. Using MS-DOS Editor, edit the DBLSPACE.INI file and increase the value for
      MaxFileFragments (2600 is a good value to try).

   c. Save the DBLSPACE.INI file and quit MS-DOS Editor.

   d. Use the ATTRIB command to reset the file attributes on DBLSPACE.INI. For
      example, if your host drive is drive H, type the following command and
      press ENTER:

   " attrib h:\dblspace.ini +r +s +h" (without the quotation marks)

2. Restart your computer and try to mount the drive again. If you still cannot
   mount the CVF, proceed to step 3.

3. Run a surface scan utility, such as Symantec's Norton Utilities Norton Disk
   Doctor (NDD.EXE) version 7.0 or later. If you still cannot mount the CVF,
   proceed to step 4.

4. Clear the file attributes from the DoubleSpace CVF and defragment the drive
   using the procedure below.

   WARNING: If the DoubleSpace CVF is mounted when you perform this procedure,
   you will corrupt your DoubleSpace drive.

   a. Unmount your DoubleSpace drive or start your computer from an MS-DOS 6.0
      system disk in drive A that does not have a DBLSPACE.BIN file.

   b. Remove the Read-Only, System, and Hidden file attributes on the
      DBLSPACE.<XXX> file. For example, if the file is H:\DBLSPACE.000,
      type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER:

   " attrib h:\dblspace.000 -r -s -h" (without the quotation marks)

   c. Run Microsoft Defragmenter (Defrag) by typing "defrag" (without the
      quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and pressing ENTER.

   d. Use the ATTRIB command to reset the file attribute on
      DBLSPACE.<XXX>. For example, if the file is H:\DBLSPACE.000, type
      the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER:

   " attrib h:\dblspace.000 +r +s +h" (without the quotation marks)

   e. You should now be able to mount the CVF if you unmounted it. If you
      restarted your computer from drive A in step a, restart your computer from
      drive C.
