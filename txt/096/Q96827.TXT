TITLE   :VSAFE Err Msg: "...Is Trying to Modify System Memory"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Each time you start your computer, you receive an error message stating that the
system memory is being modified.

CAUSE
=====

If you continually receive this error message, either you are running VSAFE with
the /2+ parameter (which checks for programs that load as memory resident), or
one of your programs is causing the error because it does not use the MS-DOS
Interrupt 21 application program interface (API) function to load as memory
resident.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the VSAFE /2+ parameter to /2-. This
disables the memory check for standard memory-resident programs.

If the warnings continue, note the program that causes the error message. This
program is not using the standard method to load as a memory-resident program
(Int 21h). Once you note which program is causing the problem and verify that it
is not infected with a virus, load VSAFE after that program in the AUTOEXEC.BAT
file.
