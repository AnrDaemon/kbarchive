-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If NewWave is in your AUTEOXEC.BAT file when you run MemMaker, MemMaker cannot
continue if you quit NewWave.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, either add NewWave to the MEMMAKER.INF file or
remark out NewWave when you run MemMaker.

To add NewWave to the MEMMAKER.INF file:

1. Edit the MEMMAKER.INF file with an ASCII text editor, such as MS-DOS Editor.

2. Add NewWave to the end of the MEMMAKER.INI with an asterisk (*) before the
   program name. For example:

   *newwave

   To remark out NewWave when you run MemMaker:

3. In your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, use the REM command to remark out NewWave. The
   line should appear as follows:

   rem newwave

4. Restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

5. Run MemMaker.

6. When MemMaker has completed, remove the REM command from your AUTOEXEC.BAT
   file so that NewWave can load again.

7. Restart your computer.

NewWave is manufactured by Hewlett-Packard Company, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
