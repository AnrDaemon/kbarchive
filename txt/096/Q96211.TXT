SUMMARY
=======

Encarta hangs on a system with the Orchid Farenheit VA card using the
ORCHIDV.DRV driver (122,752 bytes and dated 01/11/93) in the 800 x 800 mode
(64K).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using the 16-million-color mode or 256-color mode on this card allows Encarta to
work properly. There is no 32K color driver available, but these alternate modes
use different drivers that do not exhibit this problem.

If you experience this problem, contact Orchid Technology technical support at
(510) 683-0300 for more information.

The Fahrenheit VA is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make
no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
