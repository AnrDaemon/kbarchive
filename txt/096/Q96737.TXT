TITLE   :FTADMIN Incorrectly Shows Phantom Drives or Problems
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

At times FTADMIN will incorrectly show phantom drives and/or phantom errors.
These problems, though surprising, are easily correctable.

PROBLEM ID: BUG# 406

SYMPTOMS
========

   At times FTADMIN will report drives as being cracked, displaying a question
   mark (?) where the drive letter should be. Viewing information about the
   drive will show a code ???, critical level, a disk block with a ridiculous
   number (4291035135, 4294967295 and 4294905600 have been seen, even if the
   block size was 512 bytes [these figures represent a location of just under 2
   terabytes]) and a drive type unknown. This can occur on "raw" drives (not
   partitioned) or it can be a truly "phantom" (non- existent) drive. When
   <Correct all errors on drive> is selected a Net 2533 will be produced.
   Choosing OK at this point will cause the cracked drive to go away.

CAUSE
=====

   There are at least two known ways to produce this problem. The first is to go
   into FDISKPM, create a partition on a "raw" drive, and exit the program
   without saving the changes. Making a change and exiting FTSETUP without
   saving the changes will produce the same result. This problem appears to
   persist through system shutdowns and reboots, but not through a power down
   and reboot. The other known way to produce this problem is to attempt to run
   the Verify option of FTADMIN (locally) and WFTADMIN (remotely) at the same
   time (see related article on concurrency).

RESOLUTION
==========

   As mentioned earlier, choosing OK after receiving the Net 2533 message will
   cause the cracked drive to go away.

   Attempting to correct the phantom drive by selecting <Correct> then
   <All errors on all drives> may not work. The phantom drive itself may
   have to be selected and then use <Correct>, <All errors on selected
   drive>.
