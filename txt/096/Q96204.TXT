-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have an SCSI hard disk and MemMaker stops responding (hangs), a device
driver may be loading into upper memory before the SMARTDrive double_buffer
driver in the CONFIG.SYS file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem,

1. Restart your computer (if you haven't already done so).

2. When MemMaker prompts you for input, choose Cancel And Undo Changes.

3. Use MS-DOS Editor to add the following line to the beginning of your
   CONFIG.SYS file:

      device=c:\dos\smartdrv.exe /double_buffer+

   NOTE: If this line already appears in your CONFIG.SYS file, make sure it is
   the first line.

4. Save your CONFIG.SYS file.

5. Try running MemMaker again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If this does not correct the problem refer to Chapter 6 of the "Microsoft MS-DOS
6 User's Guide" for information about troubleshooting MemMaker.
