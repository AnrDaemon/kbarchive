KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for Macintosh, version 2.01 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the @ ... SAY command for a nonempty memo field prints the word "memo"
instead of the text within the memo field.

RESOLUTION
==========

To display the text within the memo field, specify a SIZE clause with the @ ...
SAY command.

NOTE: The SIZE clause must be more than one row high for this resolution to work.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, suppose you have a memo field named "memfield" that contains the
following text:

   I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the
   Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with
   liberty and justice for all.

Issuing these commands        Produces this output
--------------------------------------------------

@ 1,1 SAY memfield && prints just the word memo

@ 3,1 SAY memfield SIZE 5,25 && prints the Pledge of Allegiance in

   && a 5-row-by-25-column space
