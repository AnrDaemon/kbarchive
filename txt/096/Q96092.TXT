OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print from Windows for Workgroups to a network printer while Banyan
VINES connectivity is installed, you can print only one job per Windows session.
If you send a second print job, that job is lost and an error message is
displayed. For example, if you try to print from Microsoft Windows Write, you
receive the following error message:

   CANNOT PRINT
   Be sure that your printer is connected properly & use the Printers option
   in the Control Panel to verify that the printer is configured properly.

NOTE: If you print from Microsoft Word 2.0 for Windows, the second print job is
lost but no error message appears.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by the Banyan VINES redirector, REDIRALL.EXE.

STATUS
======

Banyan is aware of this problem. We will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available. For more information, contact

WORKAROUND

3. Save the WIN.INI file.

4. Run Control Panel and choose Printers.

5. Select the printer.
