SUMMARY
=======

There are multiple Help files for version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for
Windows. Because they are not combined into a single Help file, searching for
information can show different results in each file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Mail Remote for Windows ships in the United States with three separate Help
files:

 - MSMAIL.HLP: The standard Help file for Windows Mail.

 - MSRMT.HLP: The online Help file for remote mailing issues.

 - RMTPSS.HLP: A Help file created with information from calls to Microsoft
   Product Support Services to aid with specific issues about using the product,
   including information needed when you cannot get the product to start. This
   has its own icon when installing Mail Remote for Windows.

NOTE: There is additional technical help in the file named README.TXT which is
useful for mail administrators. This file is also installed with an icon during
Setup for easy viewing.
