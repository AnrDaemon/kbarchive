TITLE   :Installing OS/2 on a Compaq Prosignia
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

The new Compaq Prosignia line of computers uses a "Fast SCSI-II" interface for
their drive systems. A special .BID file is needed to install OS/2 1.3.1 on
these machines.

If this file is not present during installation, the following error message is
displayed:

   Cannot locate fixed disk drive

MORE INFORMATION
================

Compaq supplies the proper .BID file (CPQC710.BID) on the Software Support Disk
#1 (1.01 or later) supplied with their machines. CPQC710.BID can also be
retrieved from CompuServe in the Compaq forum or from Compaq's BBS
(713-378-1418: 9600,n,8,1). Once the correct .BID has been retrieved, make a
copy of your Install A disk, delete all the *.BID files from the copy, copy the
CPQC710.BID file to the disk as BOOTBID.BID, and the use the disk to install
OS/2 onto the Prosignia.
