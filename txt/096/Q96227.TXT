TITLE   :MS-DOS wrkheuristic 14 (Raw Data) Documented Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
Workheuristic 14 is documented incorrectly on page 250 of the LAN
Manager 2.2 "Administrator's Reference." Using the values listed will
affect your system in a way opposite to what you intend.

The documentation reads:

   14 Controls use of raw data transfer SMB protocols.

   0 = don't use
   1 = use

This is incorrect. The documentation should read:

   14 Controls use of raw data transfer SMB protocols.

   0 = use
   1 = don't use

REFERENCES
