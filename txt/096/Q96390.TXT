SUMMARY

DoubleSpace supports disk compression on both floppy disks and removable media
disks; however, when you swap a floppy or removable media disk you must remount
the disk.

STATUS
======

This information does not apply to later versions of MS-DOS and DoubleSpace.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To mount a disk from the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following:

   " dblspace /mount drive " (without the quotation marks)

where "drive" is the drive location of the disk.

Automation of this feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion
in a future release.

NOTE: If you are using Microsoft Windows, you cannot remount floppies or
removable media.
