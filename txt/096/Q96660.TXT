The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

The Margins feature that was added to most version 2.0 Windows 3.1 dot-matrix
printer drivers was omitted from the CIT24US.DRV file included in the Windows
Driver Library.

This article provides a workaround for adjusting the unprintable regions defined
by the Citizen printers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With most Windows 3.1 dot-matrix printer drivers, you can adjust the unprintable
regions defined by the printer. You can make this adjustment using the Margins
feature after you press the Options button in the Printer Setup dialog box.

This feature was not included with version 2.0 of the Citizen 24-pin dot-matrix
printer driver, CIT24.US.DRV. This driver is used by the following printers:

   Citizen 124D
   Citizen 224
   Citizen GSX-130
   Citizen GSX-140
   Citizen GSX-140+
   Citizen GSX-145
   Citizen PN48
   Citizen Prodot 24
   Citizen Swift 24
   Citizen Swift 24e
   Citizen Swift 24x

To work around this problem and adjust the unprintable region for these printers,
roll the paper back so that the printhead is directly below the perforation,
then turn the printer off and back on. (If necessary, you may need to roll the
paper forward by one sheet to get the alignment correct.) When you print "This
is a test" from MS-DOS, the top of the capital letter "T" should be flush with
the perforation.
