TITLE   :Windows Hangs at Logo Screen with FTP Network and DoubleSpace
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.22

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are running FTP Software's PC/TCP network software and Microsoft Windows
in 386 enhanced mode, Windows may stop responding (hang) at the logo screen
after you have compressed a drive with DoubleSpace.

CAUSE
=====

Your SYSTEM.INI file may contain the line DEVICE=C:\PCTCP\VPCTCP.386 in the
[386Enh] section. If it does, Windows may hang.

The system hangs if the line DEVICE=C:\DOS\DBLSPACE.SYS /MOVE is not present in
your CONFIG.SYS file before any of the drivers that load the network.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, add or move the line C:\DOS\DBLSPACE.SYS /MOVE before
the first line that loads the network software. In most cases, the first line
that starts the network is something similar to C:\PCTCP\PROTMAN.SYS
/i:C:\PCTCP.
