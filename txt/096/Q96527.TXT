======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Server Connection application with version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail
for AppleTalk Networks, the following error message may appear in the status
box:

   Time out value exceeded.

CAUSE
=====

There are usually three reasons why this error message will be displayed:

 - The line quality between the two communicating servers is poor. Ensure you
   are getting a good connection from your carrier.

 - The Allow Access To: option in the Remote Access Setup Control Panel is set
   to Entire Network. Microsoft recommends that This Macintosh Only be selected.

 - The termination on either side of the network is poor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The server has a limited number of processes it can run at any given time. If a
machine has access to the entire network when it dials in, the software will
attempt to scan the remote network looking for other Microsoft Mail Servers to
communicate with. This will take additional time, which can cause the timeout
error to occur.
