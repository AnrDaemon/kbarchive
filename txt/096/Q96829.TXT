-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The WINA20.386 file is a read-only file that is copied to the root directory on
your hard disk (startup) drive when you set up MS-DOS 5 Upgrade, MS-DOS 6
Upgrade, or MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade on a computer that is capable of running
Microsoft Windows in 386 enhanced mode. Microsoft Windows version 3.0 cannot run
in 386 enhanced mode without this file.

NOTE: You do not need the WINA20.386 file if you run any other version of
Microsoft Windows, or if you do not run Microsoft Windows version 3.0 in 386
enhanced mode. For a discussion on running the 386 enhanced, standard, and real
modes in Microsoft Windows, see the Microsoft Windows "User's Guide."

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you do not have the WINA20.386 file and you try to run Windows version 3.0 in
386 enhanced mode, the following message is displayed:

   You must have the file WINA20.386 in the root of your boot drive to run
   Windows in Enhanced Mode

Installing the File
-------------------

If you see this message, use the EXPAND command to expand and copy this file from
your MS-DOS installation disk to the root directory of your startup drive. The
file is located on the following disks:

   MS-DOS Version        3.5-inch Disks   5.25-inch Disks
   ------------------------------------------------------

   MS-DOS 5.0 Upgrade          3                 5
   MS-DOS 6.0 Upgrade          1                 2
   MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade          1                 2
   MS-DOS 6.21 Upgrade         1                 2

To install the file, insert your installation disk in your floppy disk drive,
type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt, and press ENTER

   " expand <drive>:\wina20.38_ <startupdrive>:\wina20.386" (without
   the quotation marks)

where <drive> is the floppy disk drive containing your MS-DOS installation
disk and <startupdrive> is your startup drive (usually drive C). For
example if your floppy disk drive is drive A and your startup drive is drive C,
type the following command:

   " expand a:\wina20.38_ c:\wina20.386" (without the quotation marks)

Deleting the WINA20.386 File
----------------------------

You can delete the WINA20.386 file from your hard disk if you do not use
Microsoft Windows version 3.0 in 386 enhanced mode.

To delete the file:

1. Remove the read-only attribute by typing the following at the MS-DOS command
   prompt and pressing ENTER:

   " attrib -r <startupdrive>:\wina20.386" (without the quotation marks)

2. Delete the file by typing the following command:

   " del <startupdrive>:\wina20.386" (without the quotation marks)

Moving the WINA20.386 File
--------------------------

You can move the WINA20.386 file to a new directory as follows:

1. Copy WINA20.386 to the new location. Type the following at the MS-DOS command
   prompt and press ENTER

   " copy <startupdrive>:\wina20.386 <path>:\wina20.386 " (without
   the quotation marks)

   where <path> is the drive and directory to which you are moving
   WINA20.386. For example, if you are moving WINA20.386 to your Windows SYSTEM
   subdirectory on drive C, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and
   press ENTER:

   " copy c:\wina20.386 c:\windows\system\wina20.386 " (without the quotation
   marks)

   NOTE: If you have MS-DOS 6 or 6.2 Upgrade, substitute MOVE for COPY in the
   command shown above and skip to step 4.

2. Use a text editor, such as MS-DOS Editor, to open your CONFIG.SYS file. If
   you want to use MS-DOS Editor, type the following at the MS-DOS command
   prompt and press ENTER:

   " edit <startupdrive>:\config.sys" (without the quotation marks)

3. Add the following command on a line of its own at the end of your CONFIG.SYS
   file:

   " switches=/w" (without the quotation marks)

4. Save your CONFIG.SYS file. If you are using MS-DOS Editor, choose Exit from
   the File menu. When MS-DOS Editor displays a dialog box prompting you to save
   your file, choose the Yes button or press ENTER.

5. Use the text editor to open your Windows SYSTEM.INI file. (This file should
   be in your Windows directory.)

6. Find the section that begins with the header [386Enh].

7. Add this command under the [386Enh] heading

   " device=<path>\wina20.386" (without the quotation marks)

   where <path> specifies the new location of the WINA20.386 file. For
   example, if you want to move the file to your WINDOWS directory, add the
   following command to your Windows SYSTEM.INI file:

   " device=c:\windows\wina20.386" (without the quotation marks)

8. Save your SYSTEM.INI file. If you're using MS-DOS Editor, choose Exit from
   the File menu. When MS-DOS Editor displays a dialog box prompting you to save
   your file, choose the Yes button or press ENTER.

9. Restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.
