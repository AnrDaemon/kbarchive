-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail Gateway (GW) chooser extension version 3.0x is incompatible
with the Cache Switch Control Panel found on Apple Macintosh Quadra machines.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail
for AppleTalk Networks. This problem was corrected in version 3.1.

If a gateway is to be used on a Quadra, the Cache Switch CDEV must be disabled.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MS Mail GW extension is used for communication between the Microsoft Mail
server and a gateway. If MS Mail GW is loaded and the cache switch is enabled,
the machine will stop operating on startup. The cache switch turns on the 8K
copy-back caching scheme used on Quadra machines.
