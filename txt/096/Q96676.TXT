The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TrueType Master Set, version 1.0 
 - Macintosh System Software, versions 7.0, 7.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In the Microsoft TrueType Master Set for the Macintosh, fonts may all look the
same when you preview them using the System 7 Font Sample feature.

This similarity in appearance occurs because Font Sample uses "sfont" ID numbers
to determine which font to use to display the sample. TrueType Master Set
identifies these sfont ID numbers the same for each suitcase, which causes one
font sample to appear the same as another.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use the System 7 Font Sample feature, double-click a font suitcase and then
double-click a font name to view a sample of the font.

This problem does not occur if you install the fonts into the System or if you
move the fonts into the same suitcase. In both situations, the System reassigns
a unique sfont ID value to each font in the suitcase.
