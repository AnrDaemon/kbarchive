SUMMARY
=======

The sample code below displays the title of the window that has the focus. It
demonstrates how to use the FOXTOOLS.FLL library commands to call the following
Microsoft Windows application programming interface (API) functions:

      GetFocus()
      GetWindowText()

MORE INFORMATION
================

The program first loads the FOXTOOLS.FLL library that is supplied with FoxPro
for Windows and creates a variable. Next, it retrieves the handle to the window
that has the focus, that is, the currently active window. It then calls the
GetWindowText() function, passing the second parameter by reference by using the
@ sign. This is the variable that will hold the title of the window. It then
displays the window title.

      set library to sys(2004)+"foxtools.fll" additive

      * create a string variable to hold the title
      * and initialize it with blank characters

      place = replicate(chr(32),80)

      * get the handle to the window

      gethwnd = RegFN("GetFocus","","I")
      hwnd = CallFN(gethwnd)

      * call the Windows function to get the title
      * using pass by reference for the variable place

      gettitle = RegFN("GetWindowText","I@CI","I")
      = CallFN(gettitle,hwnd,@place,80)

      * display the window title
      * the output ends with a null character

      ? "The window title is: " + alltrim(place)

      release library sys(2004)+"foxtools.fll"
