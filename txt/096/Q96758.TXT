SUMMARY
=======

According to DNA Lanmarc, DNA Lanmarc Network software can be used with MS-DOS
6.0 subject to the conditions described in this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

 - You must use DNA Lanmarc Network version 6.0 or later. If you use a version
   earlier than 6.0, you receive the following error message:

   Error #839 Incompatible Version

 - You must disable the network drivers in the CONFIG.SYS file before you run
   MS-DOS 6 Upgrade Setup. To do this, remark out the following lines.

      rem device=\lanmarc\master.sys
      rem device=\lanmarc\print.sys
      rem device=\lanmarc\spool.sys

   After you remark out these device drivers, restart the computer and run Setup.
   If you plan to install DoubleSpace, do so before you remove the REM
   statements and restart the computer to regain your network functionality.

 - When you run DoubleSpace, CHKDSK, or Defragmenter, you must start your
   computer without loading the previously mentioned DNA Lanmarc network
   drivers. To do this, restart your computer and press the F8 function key when
   "Starting MS-DOS..." is displayed. You can then step through your CONFIG.SYS
   file, bypassing the network device drivers.

   Some DoubleSpace features (such as LIST, CHKDSK, MOUNT, and UNMOUNT) do not
   work correctly unless the network is disabled.

   NOTE: DoubleSpace does not compress some of the DNA Lanmarc Network files.
   These files remain on the uncompressed host drive.

The DNA Lanmarc product included in this article is manufactured by a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this product's performance or reliability.
