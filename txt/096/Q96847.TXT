SUMMARY
=======


1. Q. How can I repartition my hard disk into one large partition?

   A. Changing your hard disk from multiple partitions to a single partition
   involves backing up your data files, repartitioning your hard disk, and then
   restoring your data files. To do this, you must use the Fdisk program. The
   section titled "Using Fdisk to Configure Your Hard Disk" on pages 204-216 of
   the "Microsoft MS-DOS 6 User's Guide" contains instructions for
   repartitioning your hard disk. For specific instructions about backing up
   your data, repartitioning your hard disk, and restoring your data files,
   order Application Note PD0771, "Installation and Partitioning Sequence
   Questions & Answers," from Microsoft Product Support Services.

2. Q. When I try to use DoubleSpace to compress drives, I receive the error
   "Cannot load SMARTDrive with DoubleSpace." How can I correct this problem?

   A. DoubleSpace is incompatible with versions of SMARTDrive earlier than
   version 4.1. If you are using an earlier version of SMARTDrive, DoubleSpace
   displays this error message. To correct this problem, make sure you are
   loading SMARTDRV.EXE version 4.1, which is included with MS-DOS 6.0.

3. Q. I have a hard disk with more than 1024 cylinders. Is there a way to access
   and use the entire hard disk?

   A. The MS-DOS 6 Upgrade uses the hardware BIOS to read and write to the hard
   disk drive. Due to the limitations of the standard ROM BIOS, MS-DOS accesses
   only the first 1024 cylinders of a physical hard disk. If you have formatted
   your hard disk after upgrading to MS-DOS 6 and the disk has less space
   available, consult your hardware manual or contact your hardware manufacturer
   for more information.

4. Q. When I run the Fdisk program, it does not recognize all the disk space on
   my hard disk. What is causing this problem?

   A. Fdisk relies on the BIOS to report the hard disk size. If Fdisk incorrectly
   reports that your hard disk is smaller than it actually is, either your BIOS
   is set for the wrong drive type (that is, it is set incorrectly or it does
   not support your specific drive's dimensions), or your drive has more than
   1024 cylinders.

   Contact your hardware manufacturer to determine if your BIOS is set correctly.
   If it is not, correcting the setting should allow Fdisk to recognize the
   entire hard disk. If your BIOS does not support your drive type, and your
   hard disk doesn't exceed 1024 cylinders, you may need to order a new BIOS
   from your hardware manufacturer. For more information, contact your hardware
   manufacturer.
