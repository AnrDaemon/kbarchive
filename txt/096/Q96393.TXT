-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not
been tested and are not supported by Microsoft.

If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the TCP/IP protocol stack from FTP Software in 386 enhanced mode of
Windows or Windows for Workgroups, the drive letter icons in File Manager may be
unavailable.

This problem does not occur with the Windows for Workgroups real-mode redirector.

RESOLUTION
==========

FTP Software has confirmed this to be a problem with its current driver and
provides an updated driver to correct this problem. (FTP Software provides
drivers that allow Windows for Workgroups systems to communicate over the TCP/IP
protocol stack.)

The updated file (WFWFTP.386) is dated 12/23/93 and has a file size of 9344
bytes. It should be copied into the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory and then
referenced in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file as follows:

        device=WFWFTP.386

NOTE: If you already have FTP's TCP/IP installed, you should only need to copy
the updated driver to the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory. The device= line should
already be in the SYSTEM.INI file.

For more information, contact FTP software.
