TITLE   :DoubleSpace Doesn't Mount After Installing RAMDrive
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use DoubleSpace with a removable hard drive (such as Syquest, Bernoulli,
or Quatam Passport XL) and later install RAMDrive, DoubleSpace may refuse to
mount its compressed drive(s).

CAUSE
=====

This problem only occurs if the RAMDrive DEVICE command in the CONFIG.SYS file
precedes the removable hard drive DEVICE command line. Since RAMDrive may
inadvertently use the drive letter of the removable drive, DoubleSpace may not
find the compressed volume on the expected drive. The same behavior may occur if
you remove RAMDrive after compressing your removable hard drive. (The drive
letters shift and DoubleSpace does not mount.)

WORKAROUND
==========

If this problem was caused by installing RAMDrive, you can simply move the
RAMDrive DEVICE command past the removable drive's DEVICE command in the
CONFIG.SYS file. The advantage of this workaround is that the drive letter
assignments stay the same.

If this problem occurs after removing RAMDrive, run DBLSPACE. From the Drive
menu, choose Mount. DoubleSpace scans all your drives for compressed volumes and
reassigns drive letters appropriately. This workaround may cause problems for
programs configured to specific drive letters.
