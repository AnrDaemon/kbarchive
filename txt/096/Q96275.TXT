-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.1, 3.1a, 3.1c, 3.1d 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


The communication program in the AppleLink gateway will not function correctly
with AppleTalk Remote Access (ARA) version 1.0. If ARA is installed on the
server with an AppleLink master gateway and the communication program in the
AppleLink gateway tries to initiate a call, the following error message will
occur:

   Ramsdopen: -97

CAUSE
=====

ARA utilizes the Serial Port Arbitrator to check if the serial port is in use
before attempting communication. The AppleLink gateway does not recognize the
Serial Port Arbitrator and tries to use the modem port directly. To avoid this
problem, put the AppleLink gateway on another server that does not have ARA
installed. If an alternate network connection exists such as EtherTalk or
TokenTalk, ARA may be moved to the printer port which will leave the modem port
available for AppleTalk exclusively. This solution however, requires a modem for
both the gateway and ARA.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail
for AppleTalk Networks. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
