TITLE   :BUG: PostScript Handles lfItalic Field Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft Windows environment, when the Windows version 3.1 PostScript
printer driver is installed and an application specifies a nonzero value in the
lfItalic member of a LOGFONT data structure to create an italic font, text
prints in a normal (nonitalic) font.

CAUSE
=====

The driver checks only the Least-Significant Bit (LSB) of the lfItalic field to
determine whether the specified font is italic.

RESOLUTION
==========

Specify the value 1 to create an italic font.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The documentation for the lfItalic member of the LOGFONT data structure on page
308 of the "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit: Programmer's Reference,
Volume 3: Messages, Structures, and Macros" manual for version 3.1 states that
an application can specify an italic font by placing any nonzero value into this
member. This procedure works correctly on all the display and printer drivers
provided with Windows 3.1 except for the PostScript printer driver. The Windows
version 3.0 PostScript printer driver also accepts this procedure.

If the LSB is set, the driver selects an italic font. If the LSB is clear, the
driver selects a normal font. Therefore, placing a positive odd number into the
lfItalic member selects an italic font.
