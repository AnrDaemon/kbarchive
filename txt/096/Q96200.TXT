TITLE   :DoubleSpace Cannot Mount Compressed Write-Protected Disk
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2; WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool msdos

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to mount a write-protected disk with DoubleSpace, you receive the
following error message:

   DoubleSpace cannot mount drive <x> because the file
   <x>:\DBLSPACE.nnn is not a valid compressed volume file.

where <x> is the floppy disk drive letter.

When you try to mount a write-protected removable media disk under MS-DOS 6.2,
you receive the following error:

   Dblspace cannot mount drive <drive letter>:
   The <drive letter>:\Dblspace.000 file is not a valid compressed
   volume file. To fix it, type scandisk X:\Dblspace.000 at the
   command prompt.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove the write protection for the disk.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When DoubleSpace mounts a compressed volume file (CVF), it ensures the Microsoft
DoubleSpace BIOS parameter block (MDBPB) (the overall configuration sector) and
the BitFAT (a table of available heap sectors) are current. To do this,
DoubleSpace must write to the disk. This feature is under review and will be
considered for inclusion in a future release.

You can mount a floppy disk by running DoubleSpace, or you can mount the floppy
disk with the MS-DOS DBLSPACE /MOUNT command. For example, type the following
command at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER if your floppy disk drive
is drive A:

   "dblspace /mount a:" (without the quotation marks)

For more information on DoubleSpace, type "help dblspace" (without the quotation
marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
