TITLE   :Installing OS/2 on EISA Gateway 486 with Ultrastore 24F
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

After getting the right bid file from Ultrastore and putting it on the OS/2
Install Disk, a Gateway 486/33 machine hangs after the initial OS/2 operating
system banner.

CAUSE
=====

The EISA configuration program for the Gateway computer incorrectly detects the
amount of memory that is in the system.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the problem, specify the amount of memory in the system in EISA
Config, then reboot.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Ultrastore 24F is an unsupported SCSI controller for Microsoft OS/2 1.30.1.
However, Ultrastore has a .BID file for it on their bulletin board. The bulletin
board phone number is (510) 623-9091.

You must obtain the ULTRA24.BID file from the Ultrastore BBS. You must rename
this file to BOOTBID.BID and place it on the OS/2 Install A disk. After doing
this, you can boot with this disk and proceed with the rest of the OS/2
installation.

You will need to use the EISA configuration utility from Gateway to configure the
Ultrastore controller since it is an EISA device. At this time, manually insert
the correct amount of memory to avoid the "hanging" problem.

This is an unsupported configuration, and thus should be used with caution.
