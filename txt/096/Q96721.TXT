SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Mail Remote version 3.2 for Windows, do not use the Export command
on the File menu to copy folders between the primary transport messages files
(in other words, between MSMAIL.MMF and MS_ATT.MMF).

If you use the Export command to copy folders, Mail clears the Personal Address
Book (PAB) in the destination message file and copies the PAB associated with
the current driver to the destination message file.

Additional query words: 3.20
