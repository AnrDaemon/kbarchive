SUMMARY
=======

The documentation for the Microsoft Mail Gateway to 3Com, version 1.0, contains
an error that might make installing the product more difficult.

On page 38, in the Preliminary Steps, the example for Step 2 is as follows:

   LOGON_GATEWAY:PO1/NET1 /3P.

The domain and organization are incorrectly listed as PO1/NET1. A more likely
domain and organization are MSMAIL:MS, which would use the new domain MSMAIL and
the original organization MS. The computer would log into the 3Com XNS Name/Mail
service as _GATEWAY:MSMAIL:MS.

The example is not correct even if you want to use domain PO1 in the NET1
organization because the 3Com XNS Name service does not support the slash (/)
character as a delimiter. You must use the colon (:) character.

Page 40 correctly demonstrates using the colon as a delimiter, but, as stated
above, you are more likely to use MSMAIL:MS rather than PO1:NET1 as indicated in
the documentation.
