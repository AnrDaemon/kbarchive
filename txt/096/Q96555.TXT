TITLE   :INTERLNK.EXE Doesn't Work with Xircom PPX and Pocket Adapter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Interlnk does not work properly with the Xircom Parallel Port Multiplexor (PPX)
unless it is on the logical port assigned the hardware interrupt. Since only one
of the two logical ports can be assigned the hardware interrupt and the Xircom
Pocket Adapter must be on the port assigned the hardware interrupt, you cannot
use both INTERLNK.EXE and the Xircom Pocket Adapter at the same time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By setting up a MS-DOS 6 multiple-configuration menu, you can start your
computer with the appropriate configuration for either the Xircom Pocket Adapter
or Interlnk.

NOTE: This information also applies to Intersvr, which also requires the hardware
interrupt.
