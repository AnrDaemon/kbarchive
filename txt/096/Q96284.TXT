-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for Macintosh, version 2.01 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The FoxUSER file is a resource file that FoxBASE+/Mac uses to keep track of
preferences. These preferences include window location (View window, Command
window, Debug window), colors from the color picker, and preferences for text
and program files. When viewed as an icon, the FoxUSER file looks like a fox
head with nuts and bolts.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The FoxUSER file must be moved into the System Folder after installation. This
information is not included in the documentation for earlier versions of
FoxBASE. In the March 1991 documentation and later printings, this requirement
is noted on page 2-7 of the "User's Guide." If the FoxUSER file is not in the
System Folder, one of the following problems could occur:

 - The "File does not exist" error appears when generating an .SCX file (screen
   file) while the .SCX file is open.

 - The Preferences command on the Edit menu is not highlighted when a text file
   or .PRG file is open.

 - You cannot change data types in MODIFY STRUCTURE. This could also be due to
   an INIT/CDEV conflict.

 - The

   Resource not found

   error occurs when an ALERT command is used.

 - The Define and Default Layouts do not appear under Page Layout in the Report
   Writer.

 - The View window and Command window do not appear when the application is
   first started.

 - Your color preferences are not saved and the default preferences are used.

Other resources that can be stored in the FoxUSER file include icons, pictures,
and XCMDs. If the FoxUSER file has been modified in such a way that one of these
resources is no longer there (either by reinstalling on top of the FoxUSER file
or by using an editor such as ResEdit), the error "Resource not found" results.
In report forms and screen files, a dimmed (grayed) box will appear if the
resource cannot be found.

A

   Resource not found

error message may occur if the FoxUSER file was not installed correctly; that is,
if a copy of FoxUSER was dragged off Disk 1 after FoxInstall has run.
