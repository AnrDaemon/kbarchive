PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you use any version of Symantec Norton Speed Disk prior to version 7.0 on
a compressed DoubleSpace drive, the DBLSPACE /CHKDSK command may report a very
large number of lost allocation units.

This occurs when you have set the option to Clear Unused Disk Space and then
perform a full optimization.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and
then press ENTER:

   " dblspace /chkdsk /f " (without the quotation marks)

NOTE: The Compress program from PCTools versions 5.5 and 6.0 may also cause the
above problem if the Clear Unused Disk Space option is set when you perform a
full optimization.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;

or reliability.
