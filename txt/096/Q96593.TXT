-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SUMMARY
=======

When you compress an existing drive, DoubleSpace leaves approximately 2
megabytes free on the host drive. This space is reserved for files that
DoubleSpace needs (after rebooting) while compressing an existing drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following files are stored on the host drive when you compress an existing
drive:

   COMMAND.COM
   DBLSPACE.BIN
   DBLSPACE.EXE
   DBLSPACE.HLP
   DBLSPACE.INI
   DEFRAG.EXE

DoubleSpace also stores copies of the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files on the
uncompressed portion of the host drive as follows:

   AUTOEXEC.000
   CONFIG.000

NOTE: If there are already AUTOEXEC.000 or CONFIG.000 files on the host drive,
DoubleSpace uses 001 for the file extension. If that filename is used,
DoubleSpace uses 002, and so forth.

These files are also used when you create a new DoubleSpace drive or change the
size of an existing DoubleSpace drive.

The unused portion of the 2 megabytes of reserved space is used during the
compress an existing drive process.
