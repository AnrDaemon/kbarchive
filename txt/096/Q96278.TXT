The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The server for versions 3.0 and 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks is
incompatible with Apple CD-ROM drivers versions 3.1 and earlier. If this driver
and a CD-ROM drive are added to a Mail server, the computer will stop operating
after startup.

The CD-ROM driver prevents the normal operation of the Mail server to read and
write in the background to the hard disk. This configuration is not supported in
Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks.
