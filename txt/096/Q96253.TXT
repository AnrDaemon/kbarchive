SYMPTOMS
========

Although the workstation of version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks
is compatible with Apple's A/UX environment, the server is not compatible.
Earlier versions of the Mail workstation are not compatible.

The only known problem with A/UX and the version 3.1 workstation is that the
chime will only sound once on the arrival of new mail, even if set to 2 or 3
chimes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail
for AppleTalk Networks. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
