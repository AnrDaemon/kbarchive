The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

There are four methods to change the data files that Microsoft Mail Remote
version 3.2 uses, as follows:

 - Select Options from the Mail menu, then choose the Server button

 - Copy new user data files before starting Mail Remote for Windows

 - Delete specific user data files before starting Mail Remote for Windows

 - Reinstall Mail Remote for Windows

MORE INFORMATION
================

To change the user data files without running Mail (the second option above),
copy the contents of your remote user data disk to the
<Windows_directory>\MSMAIL\MSRMT\USERINFO directory (by default,
C:\WINDOWS\MSMAIL\MSRMT\USERINFO). A file in this directory instructs Mail
Remote for Windows to use the new files to identify your login and mail access.
Mail prompts for login access according to the user identification in the new
files.

Mail Remote for Windows prompts each user for a data disk at start up if you
remove the following user data files from the disk:

 - Delete all .GLB files from the <Windows_directory>\MSMAIL\MSRMT\GLB
   directory

 - Delete all files from the <Windows_directory>\MSMAIL\MSRMT\MBG
   directory

 - Delete all files from the <Windows_directory>\MSMAIL\MSRMT\KEY
   directory

Each time you start Mail Remote for Windows, it prompts for new data files.
