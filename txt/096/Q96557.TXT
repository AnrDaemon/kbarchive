======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======


Microsoft Anti-Virus may detect a boot-sector virus (such as STONED or
Michelangelo) but fail to clean it. This problem can be caused by either of the
following conditions:

 - The boot-sector virus is on your DoubleSpace-compressed drive and your host
   drive.

 - All the virus code is not being overwritten.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Boot-Sector Virus Is on Your DoubleSpace-Compressed

Drive and Your Host Drive
-------------------------

Boot-sector viruses "infect" a drive by replacing the startup (boot) code that is
stored at the beginning of the drive. A boot-sector virus is activated when you
start your computer from the infected drive (usually drive C). Because the
startup code on a DoubleSpace-compressed drive is never run, it is not possible
for a boot-sector virus on a compressed drive to become activated. However, if a
boot-sector virus is detected on a compressed drive, it is likely that the host
drive is also infected.

You can detect and clean viruses from all local drives by using the following
command:

   msav /c /l

The /C switch causes Microsoft Anti-Virus to scan and clean the disk. The /L
switch causes Microsoft Anti-Virus to scan all local drives except A and B.

All Virus Code Is Not Being Overwritten
---------------------------------------

When a boot-sector virus infects a hard disk, it moves the original boot- sector
information to another location on the disk and replaces it with virus code.
Microsoft Anti-Virus finds the original boot-sector information and uses it to
overwrite the virus code. If the original boot-sector information is incomplete
or has been damaged in some way, some of the virus code may not be overwritten.
When Microsoft Anti-Virus scans the drive and finds the remnant of the virus
code, it reports it as a virus.

Workaround If CHKDSK Reports 655,360 Total Bytes Memory
-------------------------------------------------------

If the Total Bytes Memory reported by MS-DOS CHKDSK is 655,360 bytes, the virus
is not active, and the following steps should be taken to clean the remnant of
the virus code from the drive:

1. Back up all data on all partitions on the hard disk drive. You may want to
   use the Microsoft Backup Compare feature to ensure that all files have been
   backed up successfully.

2. If the infected hard disk drive was partitioned with MS-DOS Fdisk, the virus
   remnant can be cleaned by running MS-DOS Setup with the /M parameter. This
   refreshes the master boot record (MBR) and overwrites any remaining virus
   code.

   To prevent the virus from infecting your MS-DOS disks, ensure they are write
   protected before running MS-DOS Setup. To prevent your Uninstall disk from
   becoming infected with the virus, turn off your computer and then start it
   from a floppy disk known to be free of viruses before running MS-DOS Setup.

3. Run Microsoft Anti-Virus to determine whether the procedure eliminated the
   remaining virus code.

Workaround If CHKDSK Reports Less Than 655,360 Total Bytes Memory
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If CHKDSK reports less than 655,360 total bytes memory, the virus may still be
active. In this case, use the following steps:

1. Boot from a write-protected system disk that is known to be free of virus
   infection (such as your original MS-DOS 6 Upgrade Setup Disk 1).

   NOTE: Although the 1.2-megabyte (MB) 5.25-inch floppy disks are write
   protected, the 1.44 MB 3.5-inch floppy disks are not. If you have the 1.44-MB
   floppy disks, slide the write-protect tab so that the write- protect slot is
   open on all your disks. Scan the floppy disks to ensure they are not
   infected. If they are, order new disks from Microsoft Sales Information
   Center (MSIC) at (800) 426-9400.

2. Insert Disk 3 of either the 1.2-MB or 1.44-MB disk set in drive A.

3. Change to the MS-DOS command prompt at drive A and run Microsoft Anti-Virus.
   For example, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt, pressing ENTER
   after each line:

   " a:
   msav c: /c /l" (without the quotation marks)

4. Remove the floppy disk from drive A and restart your computer.

5. Scan all hard disk drives to ensure the virus has been removed.

NOTE: The new location of the original boot sector information may be different
for each boot sector virus. Microsoft Anti-Virus can therefore clean only the
boot sector viruses on the Microsoft Anti-Virus virus list.

Which Boot Sector Is Executed During Startup?
---------------------------------------------

If drive C is uncompressed, its boot sector is run during system startup.
If drive C is compressed, the boot sector of its host drive is run.

What the Boot Sector Does
-------------------------

The boot-sector startup code in MS-DOS versions 5.0 and later does the
following:

 - Confirms that the system files (IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS) are the first two files
   in the root directory of the drive.

 - Loads and executes the first three sectors of the IO.SYS file.

The boot sector is executed by the master boot record (MBR). If you have more
than one partition, the MBR determines which one to run using the partition
table.

How Boot-Sector Viruses Get on a Compressed Volume File (CVF)
-------------------------------------------------------------

If a drive is infected before you install DoubleSpace, some boot-virus
information may be replicated on the DoubleSpace CVF. Although it cannot affect
the system from the DoubleSpace volume, the signatures may still be detected
here. To correct this, clean both the host drive and DoubleSpace- compressed
drive.
