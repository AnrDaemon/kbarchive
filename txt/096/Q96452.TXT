-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks may prevent a Macintosh
computer with sleep ability (such as the PowerBook) from automatically going
into sleep mode.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail
for AppleTalk Networks. This problem was corrected in version 3.1a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks provides local storage for
mail users. All locally stored data is kept in a single storage file in the
user's system folder. This local data file uses a compression routine to keep
the local data file at its smallest size. This compression feature causes the
hard drive to activate on a regular basis. The machine interprets this activity
as an active process and therefore does not sleep.
