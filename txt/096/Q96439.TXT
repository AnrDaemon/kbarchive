TITLE   :Differences Between LAN Manager 2.2 and 2.2a
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

New disks for LAN Manager 2.2 are marked LAN Manager 2.2a but is NOT a new
bug-fix release of LAN Manager.

Because of licensing reasons, Microsoft has removed the TRW drivers from the disk
set, and because the disk set has changed it cannot still be called LAN Manager
2.2. The revised disk set is called LAN Manager 2.2a, although it differs from
LAN Manager 2.2 only in the absence of a single NDIS driver.

Additional query words: 2.20 2.2 2.2a 2.20a LM
