-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When POWER.EXE is loaded on advanced power management (APM) machine, the Windows
Power Control Panel may show incorrect information.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you are running Windows 3.1 on a system with BIOS chips
that support APM, and Windows 3.1 is not configured for APM.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, run Windows Setup from your Windows 3.1 disks and
select MS-DOS System With APM as the computer type.

This allows Windows power management services to take over power management from
POWER.EXE. On computers without APM support, you can safely run POWER.EXE with
Windows.
