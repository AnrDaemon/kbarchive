TITLE   :No Warning If Setup Fails to Modify Your SYSTEM.INI File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Setup with the /E parameter, if Setup cannot modify your SYSTEM.INI
file because it cannot find the [386Enh] section header, it does not display any
warning or error message.

If the SYSTEM.INI file is not updated with the line DEVICE=C:\DOS\VFINTD.386, you
receive the following error message when you start Microsoft Backup for
Windows:

   Microsoft Backup is not properly installed on this system.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, open your SYSTEM.INI file and add the following
line to the [386Enh] section:

   " DEVICE=C:\DOS\VFINTD.386 " (without the quotation marks)

Microsoft Backup for Windows should function correctly after you restart Windows.

Additional query words: 6.00 back up mwbackup
