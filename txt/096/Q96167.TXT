======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

When you attempt to run DoubleSpace or any of the DoubleSpace command line
functions from the MS-DOS Prompt with Windows 3.1 in standard mode, you receive
the following error message:

   You are running the MS-DOS Shell. To run DoubleSpace, you must first quit the
   MS-DOS Shell.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because the code used to detect MS-DOS Shell is the same as
the code to detect Windows in standard mode, and the detection for Shell
precedes the detection for Windows.
