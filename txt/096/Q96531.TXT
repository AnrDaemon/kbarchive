SUMMARY
=======

When you use version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows without being
connected to the network, you cannot initiate a meeting request with version 1.0
of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows.

You can receive and respond to meeting requests, but they will not automatically
be booked in the calendar file.

If the Schedule+ Reminders utility is used with multiple mail drivers, the
sign-in prompt may be generated twice.

Additional query words: 3.20
