TITLE   :PROFS: System Abend 0C2-0000 Attempting to IPL MS-RSCS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::2.1b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to PROFS, version 2.1b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After adding the Reroute statements to the MS-RSCS computer, an attempt to IPL
(by logging off and back into the VM ID) fails and the computer generates the
message:

   Abend code = CSIABD230E Command
   EXEC Failed - System Abend 0C2-0000.

CAUSE
=====

When you create the secondary RSCS machine, you run the VM Host Access
installation program and the MSADD program. MSADD prompts for the PROFS gateway
node name and the corresponding network and postoffice names. The program
generates simple Route and Reroute statements which you are prompted to add to
the PROFILE GCS file on the RSCS and MS-RSCS machines.

The error occurs because the GCS tables must refer to the newly created MS-RSCS
machine.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add the required references to the MS-GATE and/or MS-RSCS machine in the GCS
assembler tables and recompile the GCS.
