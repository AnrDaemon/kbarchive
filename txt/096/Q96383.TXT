TITLE   :AddStor SSUTIL Utility Reports MS-DOS 6.x as Version 5.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.21,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The AddStor compression information utility, SSUTIL, incorrectly reports the
following information about MS-DOS version 6.0:

   VERSION is MS-DOS 5.0
   REPORTED version is 6.0

CAUSE
=====

SSUTIL looks at the boot record signature to determine the version of MS-DOS. It
then calls the GetMSDOSVersion() function to determine the reported version
number.

Because the boot record signature is the same for MS-DOS 5.0 and MS-DOS 6.0,
SSUTIL incorrectly reports the version number.

NOTE: The incorrect version number detection does not cause any problems or
incompatibilities between MS-DOS 6.x and the AddStor utility.


Additional query words: 6.22 6.00 6.20
