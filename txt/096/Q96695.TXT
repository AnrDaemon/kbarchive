SUMMARY
=======

Many software installation programs modify the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
files. Most installation programs that modify the CONFIG.SYS file add lines to
either the top or the bottom of this file. If you are using multiple
configurations, these modifications may cause problems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The most common problem occurs when an installation program updates a specific
driver in the CONFIG.SYS file when multiple instances of that driver exist. Many
installation programs update only the first or last occurrence of a driver. You
can avoid multiple occurrences of device drivers in the CONFIG.SYS file by using
a [COMMON] section.

If you include a [COMMON] block at the end of your CONFIG.SYS file, you can
usually avoid problems with installation programs that add lines to the bottom
of the CONFIG.SYS file.
