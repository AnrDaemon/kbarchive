-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows or Windows for Workgroups from a Novell NetWare
workstation, you receive the following error message:

   The NETWARE.DLL file cannot be located

NOTE: There is no file named NETWARE.DLL that is used with Microsoft Windows or
Microsoft Windows for Workgroups; this error message is invalid.


CAUSE
=====

The following are possible causes of and solutions to this error:

 - The versions of NETX.COM and IPX.COM are incompatible. (For example, IPX.COM
   version 3.1 is incompatible with NETX.COM version 3.22. To correct this
   problem, install NETX.COM version 3.26.)

   For more information on correct versions of IPX.COM and NETX.COM, query on the
   following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   novell and driver and versions and windows and 3.1 and netx.com

 - The NETWARE.DRV file is corrupted. To correct this problem, remove and then
   re-expand the NETWARE.DRV file.

 - If you issue a LAPLINK command from a workstation that is set up for a Novell
   network to a workstation that is not, you may receive the above error. To
   eliminate it, run Windows Setup on the computer that is set up for a network
   and change the Network option to No Network.

 - If you are running the After Dark screen saver, manufactured by Berkeley
   Systems, you may receive the above error. To correct this problem, disable
   After Dark.

 - If you start FileMaker PRO for Windows, manufactured by Claris, while running
   Windows version 3.1 on a Novell NetWare network, you may receive the above
   error message. This problem is caused by using an incorrect installation of
   FileMaker PRO.

   According to Claris Technical Support, FileMaker PRO should be installed with
   a "clean boot" and without any virus-detection software running.
   Additionally, the Novell NetWare option must be selected if the workstation
   is attached to a Novell NetWare network. After installation, the original
   workstation configuration can be restored. For additional information,
   contact Claris Technical Support.

 - If you are running Intel Storage Express, you may encounter this error. To
   correct the problem, disable Storage Express.
