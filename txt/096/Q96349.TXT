SUMMARY
=======

Page L3-559 of the "Language Reference" incorrectly states that the FoxPro for
Windows-style Help file can be placed in a user-defined window or the main
FoxPro window. This is true only if the .DBF-style Help file, not the
Windows-style Help file, is being used. The manual incorrectly implies that the
Windows-style Help file can be placed in a user-defined window or the FoxPro for
Windows main screen with the IN WINDOW SCREEN or IN SCREEN option.

In addition, the NOWAIT option works only with the .DBF-style Help file. The
manual incorrectly indicates that the NOWAIT option will work with the
Windows-style Help file.
