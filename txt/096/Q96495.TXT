SUMMARY
=======

When you run the Games Configuration icon to configure Windows Sound System to
support MS-DOS-based games to run with Windows; the previous board settings are
recorded in the [sndsys.drv] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For MS-DOS-based games to run in Windows, the Windows Sound System hardware has
to be reconfigured. The Games Configuration program allows you to select a
different IRQ and Port address. Set the Windows Sound System board to be
compatible with most MS-DOS-based games or programs that use sound. The IRQ
choices are 7 or 9, and the Port or I/O addresses are 210h, 220h, 230h, 240h,
250h, and 260h. After you carefully select the new settings you need to restart
Windows so that the new settings take effect. The old settings are recorded in
the [sndsys.drv] section of the SYSTEM.INI file as follows:

   previousIRQ=11
   previousDMADAC=0
   previousDMAADC=0
   previousDMABufferSize=0

The sample settings above are from a default Windows Sound System installation.

Notice that there is no entry for the previous I/O address. This is because the
port address gets remaped in memory and the I/O address being used by Windows
Sound System is actually the one set during installation.
