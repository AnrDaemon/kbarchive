TITLE   :Cannot Lower Estimated Compression Ratio with DoubleSpace
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

DoubleSpace doesn't allow you to lower the estimated compression ratio (ECR).

CAUSE
=====

When you lower the ECR, you effectively reduce the size of the compressed drive.
Reducing the size of the compressed drive requires reducing the size of the file
allocation table (FAT). If there is an entry in use near the end of the FAT,
DoubleSpace cannot reduce the size (lower the ECR).

The following are examples of conditions that can prevent DoubleSpace from
lowering the ECR:

 - Lost allocation units at the end of the compressed drive

 - Heavily fragmented files on the compressed drive

 - A file (with Hidden and/or System attributes set) stored at the end of the
   compressed drive

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct the lost allocation unit problem, run ScanDisk on the compressed
drive (if you are using MS-DOS 6.0, run CHKDSK /F).

To correct the fragmented drive problem, run DEFRAG /F /H on the compressed
drive.

To correct the hidden-system file problem:

1. Use the DIR command to search for system files on the compressed drive. For
   example, if your compressed drive is drive C, type "dir c /s /as /p" (without
   the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER. Make
   note of the files that are listed.

   The following chart lists programs that are known to write system files at the
   end of a drive:

   Program name                  Program filename      System file created
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Microsoft MS-DOS Mirror           MIRROR.COM              MIRORSAV.FIL
   Central Point Mirror              MIRROR.COM              MIRORSAV.FIL
   Symantec Norton Image             IMAGE.EXE               IMAGE.IDX
   Symantec Norton Format Recover    FR.EXE                  FRECOVER.IDX
   Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0 Undelete     MIRROR.COM              PCTRACKR.DEL
   Microsoft MS-DOS 6.0/6.2 Undelete
    - Delete Tracker                 UNDELETE.EXE            PCTRACKR.DEL
    - Delete Sentry                  UNDELETE.EXE            CONTROL.FIL
   Central Point Undelete
    - Delete Tracker                 UNDELETE.EXE            PCTRACKR.DEL
    - Delete Sentry                  UNDELETE.EXE            CONTROL.FIL

2. Use ATTRIB to remove the file attributes on the system files you found in
   step 1. For example, if you have a Mirror file on drive C, type the following
   at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER:

   " attrib -r -s -h c:\mirorsav.fil" (without the quotation marks)

   NOTE: If the system files you found are used by a delete-tracking program
   (refer to the table in step 1), you need to reboot your computer without
   loading the corresponding program file before you change the file attributes
   on the system file. To do so, reboot your computer and press F5 when the
   "Starting MS-DOS..." prompt is displayed.

3. Run Microsoft Defragmenter on the compressed drive. Change to the compressed
   drive and type "defrag /f /h" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS
   command prompt.

You should now be able to lower the ECR on the DoubleSpace-compressed drive.

If you were able to successfully lower the ECR on the compressed drive, reset the
file attributes on the system file addressed in step 2. For example, type the
following at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER:

   " attrib +r +s +h c:\mirorsav.fil" (without the quotation marks)

NOTE: The DoubleSpace ECR is not based solely on the expected compressibility of
new data; it is also dependent on the size of the compressed volume file (CVF).
You may need to resize the compressed drive to change the ECR to the desired
value.
