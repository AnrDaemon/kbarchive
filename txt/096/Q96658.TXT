TITLE   :PROFS: VM Host Screen Keyboard Locks Up
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, versions 2.1b, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When the Microsoft Mail Gateway to PROFS, versions 2.1b and 3.0, process files,
the keyboard on the VM host portion of the gateway locks up and the PROFS
gateway hangs or crashes. When you view the VM host screen, the X-F keyboard
lock up symbol appears on the lower left corner of the screen.

The Host screen keyboard locks up because the gateway does not set the Reset key
after it executes a command.

In versions of VMGATE.EXE earlier than version 3.0, you had to restart the
gateway, bringing up both the LAN and host sides. VMGATE version 3.0 uses a new
algorithm when it sends a string to the MS-GATE VM ID. In the new algorithm,
VMGATE sends the following keystrokes before it sends a string:

 - RESET

 - HOME

 - ERASE EOF

to perform these tasks:

 - ensure that the host screen is ready to accept a new screen

 - position the cursor at the start of the input field

 - erase any string that was entered previously

Note: HOSTDISP version 2.1b does not correct this error.

Additional query words: 2.10b 3.00 hang crash hung
