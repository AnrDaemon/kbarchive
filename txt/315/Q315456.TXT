SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to browse to an Active Server Page (ASP) database results page
created with Microsoft FrontPage, you may receive an error message similar to
one of the following:

   Database Results Error
   [Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access Driver]
   General error
   Unable to open registry key 'Temporary (volatile) Jet DSN for process 0x3f8
   Thread 0x764 DBC 0x2150064 Jet'.

   -or-

   Database Results Error
   [Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access Driver]
   The Microsoft Jet database engine cannot open the file '(unknown)'. It is
   already opened exclusively by another user, or you need permission to view
   its data.


CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if incorrect NTFS permissions are defined for your
system %TEMP% folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, correct the permissions to the folder specified in your
system's %TEMP% variable.

NOTE: The Microsoft Jet database engine uses the System %TEMP% environment
variable to specify the location to place temporary files that are created
during Jet operations. On Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 these environment variables
are defined for users and are not system-wide settings by default. For more
information, please see the "More Information" section later in this article.

To correct the permissions of your systems %TEMP% variable, follow these steps:

1. Locate your system's TEMP folder:

   a. Follow the appropriate steps for your version of Windows:

       - For Windows XP: On the Start menu, click Control Panel, click the
         Performance and Maintenance icon, click the System icon, click the
         Advanced tab, and then click the Environment Variables button.

       - For Windows 2000: right-click My Computer on your desktop, click
         Properties on the menu that appears, click the Advanced tab, and then
         click the Environment Variables button.

       - For Windows NT: right-click My Computer on your desktop, click
         Properties on the menu that appears, and then click the Environment
         tab.

   b. Find the %TEMP% variable in the list of System variables and take note of
      the folder that your system is using.

2. Start Windows Explorer.

3. In Folders view, expand the path to your temporary folder.

4. Right-click the folder and click Properties on the shortcut menu.

5. On the Security tab, add Everyone to the existing permissions, assign it
   Change permissions, and apply these new settings to all files and subfolders.

6. Click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT 4.0 and TEMP Folders:

1. Right-click My Computer, and then click Properties on the shortcut menu.

2. Click the Environment tab.

3. Inspect the list to see whether the %TEMP% variable is present and correctly
   identified. If not, skip to step 4.

4. Select an entry in the System Variables List box, and then click New.

5. In the Variable box, type "TEMP" (without the quotation marks), and in the
