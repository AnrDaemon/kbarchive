MORE INFORMATION

CD-ROM: Correction To Sample Code
---------------------------------

The typo is in the GetData function, for the two sample code files
CacheAuthorsClearButton.aspx and AuthorsTrigger.aspx. Change:

   Function GetData() As DataSet
      Dim myDS As New DataSet()
      Dim ConnStr As String
      ConnStr =
   "server=(local)\NetSDK;database=pubs;Trusted_Connection=yes"
      Dim SQLSelect As String
      SQLSelect = "SELECT au_id, au_lname, au_fname, "
      SQLSelect &= "zip FROM Authors WHERE zip = '94609'"
      Dim mySqlConn As New SqlConnection(ConnStr)
      Dim mySqlDA As New SqlDataAdapter(SQLSelect, ConnStr)
      mySqlDA.Fill(myDS)
      Return myDS
   End Function

To:

   Function GetData() As DataSet
      Dim myDS As New DataSet()
      Dim ConnStr As String
      ConnStr =
   "server=(local)\NetSDK;database=pubs;Trusted_Connection=yes"
      Dim SQLSelect As String
      SQLSelect = "SELECT au_id, au_lname, au_fname, "
      SQLSelect &= "zip FROM Authors WHERE zip = '94609'"
      Dim mySqlDA As New SqlDataAdapter(SQLSelect, ConnStr)
      mySqlDA.Fill(myDS)
      Return myDS
   End Function

Because the SqlDataAdapter class can automatically open and close its own
SqlConnection object, the SqlConnection object, mySqlConn, is not necessary.

Alternatively, you could explicitly create and open the connection, and pass it
as an argument to the constructor of the SqlDataAdapter object. With this
technique, you would also need to explicitly close the connection after filling
and returning the DataSet to the caller.


Page 68: Error In Code Sample
-----------------------------

There is an error in the code sample on page 154.

Change:

   Dim s(5) As String

To:

   Dim s(4) As String


Page 119: Missing Closing Bracket In Code Sample
------------------------------------------------

There is an error in the code sample on page 119.

Change:

   <elementName2
      attributeName1=value
      attributeName2=value
      attributeNameN=value

To:

   <elementName2
      attributeName1=value
      attributeName2=value
      attributeNameN=value />


Page 154: Missing Closing Bracket In Code Sample
------------------------------------------------

There is an error in the code sample on page 154.

Change:

   <remove
      name="name"

To:

   <remove
      name="name" />


Page 196: Msg.Text Should Be Message.Text
-----------------------------------------

There is an error in the code sample on page 154.

Change:

   Else
      Msg.Text = "Incorrect Username or Password: Try again."
   End If

To:

   Else
      Message.Text = "Incorrect Username or Password: Try again."
   End If


Page 307: Correction To Step 6
------------------------------

On page 307, in step 6,

Change:

   sp_addrolemember 'db_datawriter','ASPNET'
   go

To:

   sp_addrolemember 'db_datawriter','ASPNET'
   go


Page 408: Code Listing Typo
---------------------------

On page 408, the code listing for HelloService_CB.vb contains a typo.

Change:

   Public Class Hello

To:

   Public Class Hello_CB


Page 408: Code Listing Typo
---------------------------

On page 408, the code listing for HelloService_CB.asmx contains a typo.

Change:

   <%@ WebService Class="ASPNETSBS.Hello_(B, HelloService_CB"%> 

To:

   <%@ WebService Class="ASPNETSBS.Hello_CB, HelloService_CB"%>


Page 438: Typo In GetData Function
----------------------------------

On page 438, the code listing for CacheAuthors.aspx contains a typo. The typo is
in the GetData function. Change:

   Function GetData() As DataSet
      Dim myDS As New DataSet()
      Dim ConnStr As String
      ConnStr = "server=(local)\NetSDK;database=pubs;Trusted_Connection=yes"
      Dim SQLSelect As String
      SQLSelect = "SELECT au_id, au_lname, au_fname, "
      SQLSelect &= "zip FROM Authors WHERE zip = '94609'"
      Dim mySqlConn As New SqlConnection(ConnStr)
      Dim mySqlDA As New SqlDataAdapter(SQLSelect, ConnStr)
      mySqlDA.Fill(myDS)
      Return myDS
   End Function

To:

   Function GetData() As DataSet
      Dim myDS As New DataSet()
      Dim ConnStr As String
      ConnStr = "server=(local)\NetSDK;database=pubs;Trusted_Connection=yes"
      Dim SQLSelect As String
      SQLSelect = "SELECT au_id, au_lname, au_fname, "
      SQLSelect &= "zip FROM Authors WHERE zip = '94609'"
      Dim mySqlDA As New SqlDataAdapter(SQLSelect, ConnStr)
      mySqlDA.Fill(myDS)
      Return myDS
   End Function

Because the SqlDataAdapter class can automatically open and close its own
SqlConnection object, the SqlConnection object, mySqlConn, is not necessary.

Alternatively, you could explicitly create and open the connection, and pass it
as an argument to the constructor of the SqlDataAdapter object. With this
