PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to change a password in Outlook Web Access (OWA) or browse one
of the .htr files directly, or if you try to execute a Common Gateway Interface
(CGI), Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI), or other
executable program from a directory that does not allow programs to be executed,
you may receive the following error message in the Web browser:

   HTTP Error 403

   403.1 Forbidden: Execute Access Forbidden

CAUSE
=====

The Iisadmpwd virtual directory in the Internet Service Manager does not have
script permissions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Open the Internet Service Manager Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

2. Right-click the Iisadmpwd virtual directory and then click Properties.

3. On the Virtual Directory tab, change the permissions from none to script.

NOTE: By default, IISADMPWD is installed as a physical folder under Microsoft
Windows 2000, but not as a virtual directory under Internet Information Services
(IIS) version 5.0. Because of this, IIS does not recognize that the directory
exists. For additional information, click the article number below to view the
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

If the problem persists, contact the administrator of the Web server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

IIS 4.0 includes the capability that allows a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 user to
change passwords and to receive notification when a password is about to expire.
IIS installs this functionality in the IISADMPWD virtual directory of the
default Web site. This feature is implemented as a set of .htr files that are
located in the %system%\System32\Inetsrv\Iisadmpwd directory and the ISAPI
Ism.dll extension file.

For more information about how to configure IIS to support password changes, view
the "Notifying Clients of Password Status" topic in the Windows NT 4.0 Option
Pack documentation.
