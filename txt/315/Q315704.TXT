TITLE   :PDT-Enabled Print Sessions Result in Corrupted or Missing Data
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport kbhis2000 kbhis2000bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Print sessions that are configured to use a printer definition table (PDT) on
Host Integration Server 2000 may cause missing or corrupted print output.

CAUSE
=====

The PDFcomp.exe utility that is included with Host Integration Server 2000
incorrectly truncates all macros that are defined in the printer definition file
(PDF) that contain NULL characters (X'00'). This results in a corrupted PDT
file, which can cause print output problems, such as missing or corrupted data.

WORKAROUND
==========

This problem does not occur in SNA Server 4.0, so you can usually copy a version
of the PDT file from SNA Server 4.0 to the Host Integration Server 2000 server
to correct the problem.

A PDT file that is compiled by the PDFcomp.exe utility on SNA Server 4.0 will
work on HIS 2000 in most cases. The PDFcomp.exe utility is located in the
<SNAROOT> directory on an SNA Server 4.0 system if the host print service
is installed. It is also located in the following folder on the SNA Server 4.0
CD-ROM:

   \I386\System\Printsrv

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are some example PDF macros that contain NULL characters:

P10 EQU 1B 7E 02 00 01 32
P12 EQU 1B 7E 02 00 01 3C
P13 EQU 1B 7E 02 00 01 43
P15 EQU 1B 7E 02 00 01 4B
SDW EQU 1B 7E 0E 00 01 09
EDW EQU 1B 7E 0E 00 01 0A

Each of these macros may be truncated at the position where the NULL character
occurs.

For more information about PDFs and PDT files, see the Host Integration Server
2000 Help documentation.
