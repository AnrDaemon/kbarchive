PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbvfp KbDBFDBC kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbCodeSnippet kbvfp700 _IK283

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The USE <table name> CONNSTRING command ignores the NODATA clause and
returns records. Also, CONNSTRING ignores the ALIAS keyword.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0. For additional information, click the following article number to

   Q316964 How to Obtain the Latest Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0. This problem was first corrected in Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0
Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Paste the following code in a program (.prg) file and then run the program. Make
sure that you change the user ID and password to allow the program to access
your SQL Server server.

   CREATE DATABASE Test

   lcConnString = "driver=SQL Server;database=Northwind;server=localhost;uid=sa;pwd="

   CREATE CONNECTION Testconn CONNSTRING "&lcConnString."

   CREATE SQL VIEW Test REMOTE CONNECTION Testconn AS SELECT * FROM dbo.Categories 

   USE Test NODATA ALIAS withoutConnString
   ?RECCOUNT(),"Records returned for use viewname-NODATA"  
   ** Note no records returned.
   BROWSE 

   USE Test NODATA CONNSTRING "&lcConnString." ALIAS withConnString
   BROWSE 
   ?RECCOUNT(),"Records returned for use viewname-NODATA with CONNSTRING"
   ** Note eight records returned. 
   CLOSE DATABASE ALL

The first Browse window, which displays the view that the program accesses with
the "USE Test NODATA" syntax, returns no records. This is the correct behavior.

The second Browse window, which displays the view that the program accesses with
the CONNSTRING clause, returns eight records and does not have the specified
alias.
