The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 Professional Edition

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you take the private pilot check ride test, you fail the test, even after
you complete the 360-degree hard turn. This occurs repeatedly.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the instructor does not specify the exact
requirements to correctly complete the turn.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the information below when you are flying the check
ride test. All of the following points must be met to complete the ride
successfully:

 - The altitude must remain between 1800 and 2200 feet.
 - The indicated airspeed must remain between 80 and 120 knots.
 - The bank angle must remain between 40 and 50 degrees.
 - You are allowed a cumulative total of 10 seconds below 40 degrees.
 - You are allowed a cumulative total of 5 seconds above 50 degrees.
 - Your yaw upon completion must be between 70 and 110 degrees (90 degrees is
   straight ahead).

After you complete this turn, you are instructed to turn to heading 150. Later,
you are told to turn to 180 and descend to 1300 feet. This is the last
instruction you hear from the examiner until you come to a stop on the runway.
