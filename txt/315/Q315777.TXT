KEYWORDS:kbDSupport kbhis2000 kbhis2000bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SnaBase logs the following event in the Application Event Log on a Host
Integration Server (HIS 2000) system that is configured to support Active
Directory clients if the overall length of the organizational unit (OU) name is
longer than 255 characters or if any individual node length in the OU name is
longer than 64 characters:

   Event ID: 744
   Source: SNA Base Service
   Description: DMOD initialization for Active Directory failed.

SnaBase on an HIS 2000 Admin Client that is configured to "Locate servers using
Active Directory" terminates after it logs the Event 744 when this problem
occurs. SnaBase on an HIS 2000 End User Client that is configured to "Locate
servers using Active Directory" terminates without any error messages when the
problem occurs.

CAUSE
=====

The HIS 2000 Resource Location Wizards fail to validate the overall length of
the configured OU name. In addition, the Wizards fail to validate the lengths of
the individual node names that the OU name is comprised of.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000.
