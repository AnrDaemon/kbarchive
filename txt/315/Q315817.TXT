SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running server-to-server shadowing with Windows NT 4.0 and Citrix,
non-paged pool memory may leak and eventually generate a "STOP 0x00000041" error
message on a blue screen. This problem is compounded when the shadowing session
is performing intensive graphical functions.

CAUSE
=====

Non-paged pool memory is being allocated but not freed by the Tdpipe.sys driver.
The pool tag for the pool that is being allocated is Mdl.
