1. Create a program called Test.prg and add the following code to it:

   LOCAL ax[1], oF
   DELETE FILE Testxx.sc*
   CREATE FORM testxx NOWAIT
   ASELOBJ(ax,1)  && Get an object reference to the form in the Designer
   oF = ax[1]
   oF.AddObject('Text1', 'TextBox')
   * oF.Text1.WriteMethod('Click','*')
   oF.Text1.ResetToDefault('Click')
   RETURN  

2. Save this file and then run the program.

If you uncomment the WriteMethod line so that the method is not empty and run the
code again, the errors do not occur.
