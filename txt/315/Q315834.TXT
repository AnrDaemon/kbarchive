TITLE   :SMS: Remote Control Events Not Listed in Security Event Log
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms200preSP4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you remotely control a Microsoft Windows NT-based or Microsoft Windows
2000-based Systems Management Server (SMS) client, event messages are written to
the Security event log. These messages indicate that a remote control session
has been started. However, when you remotely control a Microsoft Windows
XP-based client, no event messages are logged to indicate a remote control
session.

CAUSE
=====

With Windows XP, the Security event log is for operating system use only.
Therefore, SMS cannot register and log events in the Security event log.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Starting with SMS 2.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4), all "SMS Remote Control" events are
recorded in the Application event log for all Windows versions.
