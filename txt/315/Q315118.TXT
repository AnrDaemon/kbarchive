To do this, follow these steps:

1. Quit all programs that are running.

2. Click Start, and then click Run.

3. In the Open box, type "dxdiag" (without the quotation marks), and then click
   OK.

   The DirectX Diagnostic Tool starts.

4. Click the Sound tab, and then drag the "Hardware Sound Acceleration Level"
   slider to the "No acceleration" position.

5. Click Exit, and then test the game for proper function.

6. If the game runs correctly, attempt to increase the hardware sound
   acceleration level until it is at the highest level possible without
   corrupting sound quality in the game.
