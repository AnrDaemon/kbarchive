MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Add the line MVCOUNT=64000 to your Config.fpw file and restart Visual FoxPro.
   This ensures that Visual FoxPro can add enough entries to the name table to
   cause the error.

2. Create a program called "Test", add the following code, and then run the
   program:

   FOR x = 1 TO 50000
   	varname = "blah" + TRANSFORM(x)
   	PUBLIC &varname
   ENDFOR
   ACTIVATE WINDOW PROPERTIES

3. Make sure that the Properties window is dockable by right-clicking its title
   bar and selecting Dockable (if not already set).

4. Press ALT+TAB to switch focus away from Visual FoxPro, and press ALT+TAB
   again to return. (This packs the name table.)

5. Close the Properties window.

   Visual FoxPro closes after reporting the error mentioned in the "Symptoms"
   section.
