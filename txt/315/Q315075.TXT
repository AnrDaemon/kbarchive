Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a program called "Test" and add the following code to it:

   SET RESOURCE OFF && Take the FoxPro user file out of the picture.
   CLEAR TYPEAHEAD 
   LOCAL aobj[1], xx
   DELETE FILE testxx.sc?
   CREATE FORM testxx NOWAIT
   =ASELOBJ(aobj,1)
   xx = aobj[1]
   xx.autocenter = .t.
   xx.addobject('grid1','grid')
   ACTIVATE WINDOW properties 
   * WDOCKABLE('properties',.f.)  && Behavior occurs whether dockable or not.
   xx.grid1.columncount = 2
   xx.grid1.columns[1].name = 'Col1'
   * Trigger Properties window object dropdown.
   KEYBOARD '{ctrl+pgdn}'
   DOEVENTS 
   xx.grid1.columns[2].name = 'Col2'
   * Trigger Properties window object dropdown
   KEYBOARD '{ctrl+pgdn}'
   DOEVENTS 
   xx.grid1.columncount = 3
   xx.grid1.columns[3].name = 'Col3'
   ACTIVATE WINDOW 'form designer - testxx.scx'
   * Save form via File/Save from menu.
   KEYBOARD '{alt+f}s'
   DOEVENTS 
   MOUSE CLICK AT 200, 100 PIXELS WINDOW 'properties'
   DOEVENTS  
   RETURN 

2. Save the program file, and then execute the program from the Command window.

The preceding code is an automated example. To create the error by using the user
interface, follow these steps:

1. Create a form called "Temp". Make sure that the Form Designer window is
   normal size, not maximized.

2. Place a baseclass Grid on the form.

3. Select the grid, and then open the Properties sheet.

4. In the Properties window, change the grid's ColumnCount property to 2.

5. In the Properties window, select column 1, and then change the Name property
   to Col1.

6. In the Properties window, select column 2, and then change the Name property
   to Col2.

7. In the Properties window, change the grid's ColumnCount to 3.

8. In the Properties window, select column 3, and then change the Name property
   to Col3.

9. Click the Form Designer window title bar (not the form title bar).

10. Press ALT+F+S to save the form.

11. Click the Properties window.
