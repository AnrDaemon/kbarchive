SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open a FrontPage Web on a Web server using Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL), the FrontPage client stops responding (hangs) or you receive an
error message similar to the following:

   FrontPage is unable to establish a secure connection with the server, because
   the server's SSL certificate is either invalid, or issued by an untrusted
   certificate authority.


CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the wecctlflags registry value on the FrontPage client
computer is configured to bypass the connectivity features of Microsoft Internet
Explorer. For additional information, click the article number below to view the

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems

   Open box, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks) and click OK.

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools\Web Server Extensions\Web

3. On the Edit menu, click Modify. In the Value box, type "0" (without the
   quotation marks) and then click OK.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you set the wecctlflags value to 2, it configures the FrontPage client to
bypass the connectivity features of Internet Explorer and use it's native
functionality, which is limited to 40-bit SSL.
