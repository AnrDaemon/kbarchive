MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. On the Tools menu, click Options, click Debug, and in the Environment
   drop-down list box, select FoxPro Frame.

2. Dock the Watch window to the top or side of the desktop, and then close it.

3. Create a program named "Test, add the following code, and then run the
   program:

   *-- Code begins here.
   CLEAR ALL 
   _screen.NewObject('oLogo', 'logo')
   KEYBOARD '{alt+t}h'  && Open watch window.  SUSP, then DEBUG from CW crashes as well.)

   DEFINE CLASS logo AS image
   	oscr = _SCREEN

   	PROCEDURE oscr.Resize
   	ENDPROC
   ENDDEFINE
   *-- Code ends here.

To reproduce the problem with a Report Preview toolbar, follow these steps:

1. Close all dockable windows.

2. Run the following code from a program (.prg) file:

   *-- Code begins here.
   _screen.WindowState = 2

   SET RESOURCE ON
   CLEAR ALL 

   CREATE CURSOR c1 (f1 c(5))
   INSERT INTO c1 VALUES ('xxx')

   CREATE REPORT testxx from (DBF())
   REPORT FORM testxx PREVIEW 

   _screen.NewObject('oLogo', 'logo')
   FOR lni = 1 TO 100
      REPORT FORM testxx PREVIEW NOWAIT 
      RELEASE WINDOW 'Report Designer'
   ENDFOR 
   RETURN

   DEFINE CLASS logo AS image
   	oscr = _SCREEN

   	PROCEDURE oscr.Resize
   		?PROGRAM(), DATETIME()
   	ENDPROC
   ENDDEFINE
   *-- Code ends here.

3. When the first preview appears, dock the preview toolbar to the left side of
   the desktop and then close the preview. (The behavior may occur even if you
   do not first dock the toolbar.)

   The error appears on one of the next previews.
