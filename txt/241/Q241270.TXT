TITLE   :PRB: Foreign Connected Network Not Available with MQSeries Bridg
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbMSMQ kbMQSeriesBridge

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSMQ - MQSeries Bridge 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure the MSMQ - MQSeries Bridge, the foreign connected network may
not be available.

CAUSE
=====

Because Microsoft Message Queue Server (MSMQ) only supports the use of foreign
connected networks and foreign computers on Windows NT Server Enterprise
Edition, this problem occurs when you do not complete the Windows NT Server
Enterprise Edition setup by installing Service Pack 3. If you skip the
installation of Service Pack 3 and go directly to Service Pack 4 (or later),
this problem occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, you must reinstall Windows NT Server Enterprise, and
then install Service Pack 3 when you are prompted. The following is from the
Readme.txt file included with Windows NT Server Enterprise Edition:

   

   New Windows NT Server/E Installations:

   Installing a new copy of Windows NT Server/E is a two step process:

 - First, install Windows NT Server/E in the same way that you install Windows
   NT Server.

 - After you install Windows NT Server/E, install Service Pack 3. (A prompt
   reminds you to do this each time you log in, until you have done so.)

   Both steps are required to have a functioning Windows NT Server, Enterprise
   Edition system.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
