PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the routing on a server is being recalculated, the following error message
is displayed:

   The system attendant on server 'SERVER NAME' could not recalculate the
   routing table.

   The routing table cannot be recalculated because the remote directory is
   unavailable. Try again later.

   Microsoft exchange Administrator ID no: c1031651

The following event is logged in the application event log:

   Event ID: 5000
   Source: MsexchangeSA
   Type: Error
   Category: General
   Description: Recalculation of the routing table is complete, Result: The
   routing table cannot be recalculated because the remote directory is
   unavailable. Try again later.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Server System Attendant service is set to log on using the system
account, rather than using the Exchange Server service account.

RESOLUTION
==========

In Control Panel, double-click Services, and click to select Microsoft Exchange
System Attendant Service. Click Startup, and under Log On As, select This
Account. Type the domain and account name (<domain>\<account name>)
for the Exchange Server service account, and then type the password for the
service account.

Ensure that the Startup settings for all other Exchange Server services also use
the correct Exchange Server service account, and not the system account.
