TITLE   :WD97: Bullets Not Vertically Centered in Word Document Object
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word8 word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a Word document object containing bullets into an Excel
worksheet, a Word document, or a PowerPoint slide, the bullets may not be
vertically centered with the line of text.


CAUSE
=====

Some fonts have different display and print metrics. This is the case with some
symbol fonts used to create bullets in Word. When Word creates the display part
of an object, it renders a metafile based on the font's print metrics so that
you get a satisfactory printout.

The display part of the bullet font may have different characteristics than the
font of the text, such as the baseline for the font. This difference results in
how the bullet is displayed and printed. Microsoft Word renders the Word
document object based on the current active printer driver.

This problem is known to occur with the following printer drivers:

 - Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 4Si version 3.8


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following appropriate for your
situation:

 - Double-click the Word document object. If the object is in an application
   other than Microsoft Word (for example, Microsoft Excel), click back into the
   document sheet to regenerate the display image. If the object is in a Word
   document, click Close & Return to <filename>.

   -or-

 - Set your current printer driver to a different printer.
