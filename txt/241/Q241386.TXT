OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Performance Monitor tool and attempt to add counters to a
chart, you may receive the following error message:

   Can not find Snmpapi.dll

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you have only the NWLink protocol installed in
Windows NT 4.0. When you install the TCP/IP protocol, the Snmpapi.dll file is
copied to the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, manually copy the Snmpapi.dll file to the
%SystemRoot%\System32 folder from the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM, and then reapply
any installed service pack.
