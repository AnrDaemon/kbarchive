TITLE   :PRB: Toggling TitleBar Property Off and On Causes Form to Resize
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbContainer kbCtrl kbOOP kbvfp600 kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Changing the TitleBar property of a form programmatically causes the Width
property of the form to be increased by two every time the TitleBar property is
toggled off and on. This gradually affects the size of the form. The behavior
occurs at both Development and run time.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, store the initial value of the form before
attempting to toggle the TitleBar, and replace the value after the toggle:

   nFormWidth = ThisForm.Width          && Saves the current Form Width
   ThisForm.TitleBar = 0                && Hides the TitleBar
   ThisForm.TitleBar = 1                && Shows the TitleBar
   ThisForm.Width = nFormWidth          && Sets back the Form Width to the original value

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In Visual FoxPro, create a new program.

2. Copy and paste the following code into the new program:

   PUBLIC oform1

   oform1=NEWOBJECT("form1")
   oform1.Show
   RETURN

   	**************************************************

   DEFINE CLASS form1 AS form

   	Top = 0
   	Left = 0
   	DoCreate = .T.
   	Caption = "TitleBar"
   	Name = "Form1"

   	ADD OBJECT commandgroup1 AS commandgroup WITH ;
   		ButtonCount = 4, ;
   		Value = 1, ;
   		Height = 151, ;
   		Left = 133, ;
   		Top = 49, ;
   		Width = 119, ;
   		Name = "Commandgroup1", ;
   		Command1.Top = 18, ;
   		Command1.Left = 8, ;
   		Command1.Height = 27, ;
   		Command1.Width = 103, ;
   		Command1.Caption = "Disable TitleBar", ;
   		Command1.Name = "Command1", ;
   		Command2.Top = 47, ;
   		Command2.Left = 8, ;
   		Command2.Height = 27, ;
   		Command2.Width = 103, ;
   		Command2.Caption = "Enable TitleBar", ;
   		Command2.Name = "Command2", ;
   		Command3.Top = 76, ;
   		Command3.Left = 8, ;
   		Command3.Height = 27, ;
   		Command3.Width = 103, ;
   		Command3.Caption = "TitleBar Loop", ;
   		Command3.Name = "Command3", ;
   		Command4.Top = 105, ;
   		Command4.Left = 8, ;
   		Command4.Height = 27, ;
   		Command4.Width = 103, ;
   		Command4.Caption = "Quit", ;
   		Command4.Name = "Command4"

   	PROCEDURE commandgroup1.Command1.Click
   		ThisForm.TitleBar = 0
   	ENDPROC

   	PROCEDURE commandgroup1.Command2.Click
   		ThisForm.TitleBar = 1
   	ENDPROC

   	PROCEDURE commandgroup1.Command3.Click
   		For nLoopVar = 1 to 10
   			ThisForm.TitleBar = 0
   			ThisForm.TitleBar = 1
   		EndFor
   	ENDPROC

   	PROCEDURE commandgroup1.Command4.Click
   		ThisForm.Release
   	ENDPROC

   ENDDEFINE

3. Save and run the program.

Following are two ways to duplicate the behavior:

1. To do this manually, click on the DISABLE TITLEBAR and ENABLE TITLEBAR
   command buttons.

2. To do this automatically, click on the TITLEBAR LOOP command button.

The difference between the methods is to illustrate that the behavior occurs with
or without user interaction.
