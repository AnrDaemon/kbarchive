TITLE   :BUG: Internal Protection Fault When Using Format Function
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbVBp kbVBp600 kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Format function to format a numeric character sequence, and
include a format sequence that includes a numeric value to be used in the Null
section of the format, you may get this error:

   The instruction at "0x65396ac3" referenced memory at "0x00000028". The memory
   could not be "read"

NOTE: The exact memory locations may vary from system to system.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, you need to escape all of the characters in the
fourth section of the numeric format. For example, instead of:

   format$(Null,"#,##0.00;;;0.00")

you should do:

   format$(Null,"#,##0.00;;;\0\.\0\0")

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a Command Button to the form. It is Command1.

3. Add the following code to the form:

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
        Msgbox format$(Null,"#,##0.00;;;0.00")
   End Sub

4. Run the Code. When you press Command1, you should get an error that says:

   The instruction at "0x65396ac3" referenced memory at "0x00000028". The memory
   could not be "read".

   NOTE: The exact memory locations may vary from system to system.
