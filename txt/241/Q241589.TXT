TITLE   :Kernel Access Fault in Windows Terminal Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Sessions to Terminal Server users may disappear on retail builds of Windows NT
4.0, Terminal Server Edition (sessions that are not connected to a Windows NT
debugger session).

CAUSE
=====

The way certain programs paint the screen can cause the Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP) to use an uninitialized variable and bugcheck the server.

This problem aggravates a path in SDGSendSDARect, which has an uninitialized
variable for one rare path (bitmaps with a height of 1 and a width greater than
or equal to 12). This uninitialized variable can affect later invocations of the
function by causing a problem with a compression estimate that uses certain
assumptions. When this problem occurs (a kernel access fault,) an error message
appears. It is seen in the form of a disappearing session to a user on retail
builds of Windows NT 4.0, Terminal Server Edition (that are not connected to a
Windows NT debugger session).


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
