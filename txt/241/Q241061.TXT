TITLE   :Cannot Gain Access to Certificate Server Log and Queue
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Microsoft Certificate Server 1.0, you may be unable to gain
access to the Certificate Server log and queue from the administration Web
pages. You may receive "database access" error messages that are identified by
an E78 access failure code.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because of any of the following reasons:

 - An Internet Information Server (IIS) virtual directory settings problem. You
   cannot gain access to the Certificate Server log and queue from the
   administration Web pages unless the application attribute for the Certificate
   Administration (CertAdm) folder is applied.
 - The CertSrv DSN exists in both the User DSN and System DSN sections of the
   control panel applet.

RESOLUTION
==========

To apply the application attribute for the CertAdm folder, use the appropriate
method:

 - Apply Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6 over Certificate Server and IIS
   4.0.

 - Apply the application attribute for the CertAdm folder:

   1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack, point
      to Microsoft Internet Information Server, and then click Internet Service
      Manager.

   2. In Microsoft Management Console (MMC), expand the left pane entries until
      the default Web site is visible.

   3. Double-click the default Web site. The right pane contains the first level
      of virtual directories for the Web server.

   4. Right-click the CertAdm virtual directory, and then click Properties.

   5. In the Application Settings section on the Virtual Directory tab, click
      Create.

   6. Click Apply, and then click OK.
