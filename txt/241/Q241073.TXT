TITLE   :Error Message After Upgrading SBS 4.5 to BackOffice 4.5
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:smallbiz

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Server 4.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you restart your computer after you upgrade your Microsoft Small Business
Server-based computer to the full installation of BackOffice Server version 4.5,
you may receive an error message stating that some Dynamic Link Library (DLL)
files are mismatched.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because BackOffice Server version 4.5 includes Service Pack
1, but Small Business Server applies service pack 4 files when it is installed.
When the BackOffice 4.5 setup process runs, it attempts to install older dlls,
which are different from the Service Pack 4 DLL files and this conflict is
created.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this issue from occurring, run the Setup.exe program located on the
Windows BackOffice CD-ROM.
