   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This hotfix needs to be applied to all workstations and servers that have the
SMS Administration console installed. Secondary site servers, by default, do not
have the SMS Administration console installed and do not need this hotfix
applied unless the Administration console was also installed on that site.

To install the hotfix, use the appropriate method on the Systems Management
Server site server.

Method 1: Using the Hotfix Installer
------------------------------------

NOTE: You can only use this method on I386-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a share on your network. Q241734.exe is a
   Microsoft Windows Installer file that updates specific files on your site
   server.

2. Log on to your site server using an account with administrative privileges.

3. On the site server, close the Systems Management Server Administrator
   console.

4. Run Q241734.exe and follow the directions in the wizard. You can run the file
   in Quiet mode using the /s switch.

Method 2: Manual Installation
-----------------------------

1. Quit the Systems Management Server Administrator console and stop the Windows
   Management service.

2. Replace the Sms_musr.dll file in the
   <sms_root_directory>\bin\<platform> folder with the version
   obtained from the hotfix.

3. At a command prompt, type the following command:

   cd <sms root dir>\bin\<platform> regsvr32 sms_musr.dll

4. Restart the Windows Management service and the Systems Management Server
   Administrator console.
