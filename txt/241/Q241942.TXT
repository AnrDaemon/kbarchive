SUMMARY
=======

When using OLE Automation to Microsoft Word 2000 or Microsoft Word 97 for
Windows SR-1 or higher that prints a file, and then releases, closes, or quits
the Word object, the following warning message might appear:

   Word is currently printing. Quitting Word will cancel all pending print jobs.
   Do you want to quit Word?

The BackgroundPrintingStatus property of the Word.Application object returns the
number of jobs in Word's Background Printing queue. By checking the value of
this property, you can avoid the error message without disabling Background
Printing.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample code shows one way to use this property:

   oWord = CREATEOBJECT('Word.Application')
   WITH oWord
      .Documents.Add()
      .Visible = .T.
      .Selection.InsertAfter("Mark, why does that crate have air holes?")
      .PrintOut()
      DO WHILE .BackgroundPrintingStatus > 0
         DOEVENTS()        && Make sure you leave the OS enough time to update 
                           && the property
         *!* =INKEY(.1)	&& Use INKEY if you're running under VFP 3.0 
     ENDDO
      .Application.Quit(0) && Quit, don't save and don't prompt
   ENDwith
