SUMMARY
=======

You can use the directory export function in the Microsoft Exchange Server
Administrator program to limit the amount of storage used by messages sent to or
from one or more mailboxes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use the directory import function to apply storage limits, you create a Comma
Separated Values (CSV) file, create new columns in the CSV file, and then import
the CSV file into the Exchange Server directory. The values you include in the
new columns are used to create new attributes for the existing mailbox objects
in the directory.

To apply mailbox message size limits to multiple mailboxes:

1. Export the mailboxes from the directory to a CSV file.

2. Using Microsoft Excel, open the CSV file, and add columns for the Incoming
   Message Size Limit and Outgoing Message Size Limit, as needed. The titles of
   the new columns must appear on row 1 of the spreadsheet, and spaces between
   words in the titles are valid.

3. Enter the values for the Incoming Message Size Limit and Outgoing Message
   Size Limit in the appropriate cells. Exchange Server interprets the values
   entered in the message size limit columns as kilobytes (KB). For example, a
   value of 50 in an Incoming Message Size Limit cell is interpreted as a limit
   of 50 KB.

4. Save the CSV file.

5. Use directory import to import the CSV file into the directory.

Message limits are now set on the mailboxes, and may be verified on the Limits
page of the mailbox properties.
