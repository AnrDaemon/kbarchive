TITLE   :DHCP Client Sends NetBIOS Name Instead of Host Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your NetBIOS name and host name are different. In the Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol (DHCP) database, you see the NetBIOS name. Using the host name would be
more logical.

CAUSE
=====

The DHCP client uses the NetBIOS computer name (returned by the GetComputerName
function) to fill in the DHCP requests.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
