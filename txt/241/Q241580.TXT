PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your Handheld PC (H/PC) may use multiple Universally Unique Identifiers (UUID).
The UUIDs are created when you change the H/PC's network card or IP address.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the UUID is incorrectly implemented.

NOTE: The Terminal Server Client uses the OEM-provided UUID (if available) for
licensing purposes with the server. If your H/PC incorrectly implemented UUIDs,
the client can obtain a different UUID each time you connect to a server.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, install the latest Service Pack for Windows NT 4.0
Terminal Server Edition


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Terminal Server 4.0.
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
Terminal Server 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
