SYMPTOMS

When SNA Server 4.0 and Systems Management Server 2.0 are installed on the same
computer, an exception error may occur when you try to open the Microsoft
Management Console (MMC) plug-in for SNA Server (Mmcsna.msc) using Mmc.exe. If
Dr. Watson is configured as the default debugger on the system, a Drwtsn32.log
file similar to the following is generated when this problem occurs:

   Error:
