======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you create a pagefile on an alternate volume and restart your computer,
you may receive the following error message:

   Limited Virtual Memory. Your system is running without a properly sized
   paging file. Please use the virtual memory option of the System applet in the
   Control Panel to create a paging file, or to increase the initial size of
   your paging file.

The System tool shows a correct value for the pagefile you created, and an
incorrect entry for the Pagefile.sys file (pointing towards a temporary
pagefile) may be visible in Windows Diagnostics.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the system account does not have full control root
permission.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, verify that the system account has full control to the
root and is not a member of a denied access group. The system account should
have full control over the partition (this is the default).
