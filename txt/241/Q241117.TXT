PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When receiving an update from a directory synchronization (dirsync) requestor,
the Microsoft Exchange Directory Synchronization service (DXA) may generate the
following events in the Exchange Server application log:

   Event ID: 168
   Source: MSExchangeDX
   Description: State information could not be updated. Duplicates may be sent or
   received during the next synchronization cycle for remote dirsync
   req_name.(Thread 504).

   Event ID: 133
   Source: MSExchangeDX
   Description: Error DS_LIBRARY_ERROR, problem DS_E_BAD_ARGUMENT returned by the
   Microsoft Exchange DS. (Thread 0).

   Event ID: 143
   Source: MSExchangeDX
   Description: Unable to update the remote dirsync entry Req_name in directory
   service Exch_srv_name.

The Dirsync occurs, and the Microsoft Mail recipients appear in the Exchange
Server global address list. However, no data is sent back to the Dirsync Server
and remote requestors are not updated.

CAUSE
=====

The errors listed in the "Symptoms" section may occur when the Msvcrt.dll file
has been updated to version 6.x or later.

WORKAROUND
==========

Replace the Msvcrt.dll file with the 5.00.0000.7303 default version that is
included with Windows NT.
