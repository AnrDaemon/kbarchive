-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to run Performance Monitor locally or to monitor a remote
Windows NT-based computer, you may receive the following error message:

   Computer name not found.

CAUSE
=====

This error message can occur for any of the following reasons:

 - Client network connectivity problems

 - NetBIOS name resolution problems

 - Problems with registry permissions

 - Corrupted settings files for Performance Monitor

RESOLUTION
==========

Check NetBIOS Name Resolution
-----------------------------

Check NetBIOS name resolution and network connectivity first by typing the
following command at a command prompt

   net view \\<computername>

where <computername> is the computer to which you are trying to connect
with Performance Monitor.

Issue this command over the network and at the target computer. If the command
works successfully and you see a list of the shared resources on the server, try
the following method.

Check Registry Permissions
--------------------------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and check the permissions on the following
registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurePipeServers\Winreg

Administrators should have full control by default.

below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q164018 Controlling Remote Performance Monitor Access to WinNT Servers

Check or Replace Files
----------------------

1. In the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder, rename the Perfc009.dat file to
   Perfc009.old. Rename the Perfh009.dat file to Perfh009.old.

2. Copy the Perfc009.da_ and Perfh009.da_ files from the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM
   to the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder on the local computer.

3. At a command prompt, type the following lines in the %SystemRoot%\System32
   folder, pressing ENTER after each line:

   Expand.exe Perfc009.da_ Perfc009.dat
   Expand.exe Perfh009.da_ Perfh009.dat

NOTE: If replacing the Perfc009.dat file corrects the problem, you must reinstall
your counters for any program that you have installed previously and want to
monitor. Alternately, if you have a known good backup of this file you may be
able to restore functionality by restoring the backup copy avoiding having to
reinstall all of your counters.
