The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When a UserControl contains one or more controls that require run-time licenses,
the UserControl implicitly becomes a licensed control (requires run-time
license). As a result, when you use the Controls.Add method to add the
UserControl dynamically, you must precede it by a call to the Licenses.Add
method and provide the license key for the call.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you create a UserControl named, for example, MyProject.MyUserControl, that
contains one or more controls that require a run-time license,
MyProject.MyUserControl acquires a run-time license implicitly. Therefore, if
you use the Controls.Add method to add MyProject.MyUserControl dynamically, or
call Licenses.Add "MyProject.MyUserControl" without providing the license key,
you get the following error message:

   Run-time error '429': You do not have an appropriate license to use this
   functionality.

To make this work, you must obtain MyProject.MyUserControl's license key on the
development computer with the following code:

   Debug.Print Licenses.Add ("MyProject.MyUserControl")

Then, in the client code, you can use the following code to dynamically add
MyProject.MyUserControl:

   Licenses.Add "MyProject.MyUserControl", "License Key"<BR/>
   Form1.Controls.Add "MyProject.MyUserControl", "ControlName"
