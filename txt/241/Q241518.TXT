TITLE   :"E_OUTOFMEMORY" When Structured Storage Files Are Marshaled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0,4.0 SP4,4.0 SP5,4.0 SP6a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A process may run out of memory after opening and closing approximately 486
structured storage files. When the process runs out of heap space, error code
0x80070008 is generated.

CAUSE
=====

The marshalling process does not use standard marshaling because it is closing
the root storage after each marshal, and so behaves as if it has only one root
storage (and hence one shared heap) open at a time. Meanwhile, the unmarshaling
process keeps creating a new shared heap for each unmarshal until it runs out of
address space.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.

support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
