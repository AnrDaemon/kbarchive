CAUSE
=====

This error is generated by a third-party SMTP server or firewall.

When the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Service establishes a connection to a
remote host, the Internet Mail Service initiates the SMTP conversation with
"EHLO <domainname.com>". If an error is returned, the Internet Mail
Service falls back to "HELO <domainname.com>". If the HELO command returns
an error, an NDR is generated containing the error.
