KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to publish Internet free and busy information by using Outlook, you
may receive the following error message:

   An Error Occurred Publishing Your Internet Free/Busy Data. The URL Was
   Bad/Not Found:
   FILE://\\<computername>\<sharename>\/O=<organizationname>/OU=<sitename>/CN=RECIPIENT...

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur if a "File:" protocol that contains a variable is
specified in the Publish at this URL box that is displayed when you click
Options on the Tools menu, click Calendar Options, and then click Free Busy
Options.

The following is an example of a "File:" protocol that contains a variable:

   file://\\<computername>\<sharename>\%name%.vfb

Variables are not supported if you specify the publishing location by using a
"File:" protocol.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Do not use a variable when you use a "File:" protocol.

 - Use other protocols, such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

Additional query words: f/b, free/busy, OMI OL2000
