TITLE   :Denial of Service Generates Error Message When Using Windows Ter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg kbnetwork kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a function (such as logging on to a domain) that is performed by
Lsass.exe, you may receive the following error message:

   A controller for this domain could not be found.

Note that this behavior may be more noticeable with programs (such as Cybercop
version 2.5) that perform large amounts of RPC calls.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if Lsass.exe is no longer working properly or at all.
This can occur if Lsass.exe receives a "denial of service" by RPC, which makes a
call to SamEnumerateUsersInDomain with a NULL value for Domain Handle. This
stops LSA and then prevents anyone from logging on.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Terminal Server 4.0.
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
Terminal Server 4.0. For information about obtaining the Service Pack, query on
