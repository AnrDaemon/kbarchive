SUMMARY
=======

When you attempt to add only mailboxes to a distribution list (DL), the you must
individually select the mailboxes from the Recipients container. There is no
easy way to accomplish this in a bulk manner.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To add only mailboxes to a DL in the Recipients container:

1. Create the DL that will hold just the mailboxes (for example, Mailboxes-DL).

2. Add just one mailbox from the Recipients container to the members list in the
   DL.

3. Perform a directory export of just the mailboxes from the Recipients
   container.

4. Open the .csv file in Microsoft Excel, and view the Members column for the
   mailbox you added to Mailboxes-DL.

5. Copy and paste the CN name for the DL (for example,
   %Recipients/cn=Mailboxes-DL) to the rest of the mailboxes in the Members
   column so that all mailboxes that you want add to the newly created DL have
   the CN name.

6. Save the .csv file, and then perform a directory import of all of the
   mailboxes and make sure that the multivalued properties by default show
   append before proceeding.

7. After you have completed the directory import, you can see that all the
   mailboxes are in the newly created distribution list.
