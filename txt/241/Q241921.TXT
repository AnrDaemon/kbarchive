======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a section of text is formatted with a specific style in Word 97 and then
copied, using either CTRL+C keys or the Copy command (Edit menu) and then viewed
as an enhanced metafile through the Clipboard Viewer, the text is displayed with
the style defined in Normal.dot. This can result in clipping of the copied and
pasted section due to the font conversion.


CAUSE
=====

Word is using the default style from Normal.dot to create the metafile, as
opposed to using the style in the document from which the source text is copied.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem described in this article, obtain and install the latest
Microsoft Word 97 update from the following Microsoft Web site:
