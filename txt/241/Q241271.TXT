TITLE   :IIS 5.0 Returns 500;100 Error Page with Response.Buffer=False
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set Response.Buffer to False on an ASP page, the "500;100" error
message is still returned when an error occurs. However, when you set
Response.Buffer to False for debugging purposes, a static error message should
be returned, as it does in IIS 4.0 .

CAUSE
=====

The ASP page sends no data to the client before the error occurs. IIS 5.0
returns the custom error page because no data is provided by the static error
message when there is no data written to the client.

WORKAROUND
==========

For IIS 5.0 to return static error messages, you must disable the ASP dynamic
error page. To do this, perform the following steps:

1. In the Internet Service Manager MMC, right-click the Web site, and then
   select Properties.

2. Click the Custom Errors tab.

3. Choose the 500;100 HTTP error.

4. Change the Message Type to Default.

5. Click OK, and then click Apply.

IIS 5.0 will now return static messages when an error is received from all pages
served from this Web site.
