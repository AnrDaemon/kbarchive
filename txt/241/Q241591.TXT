======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article illustrates how to use the SetCursor and LoadCursor API calls to
change the cursor in a Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic(VBCE) application.
This approach is necessary because the Screen object in VBCE does not have a
MousePointer property. Please note that this code works only on the Windows CE
devices with a touch screen and not in the emulation environment.

================

Step by Step Example

1. Start a new Windows CE project in Visual Basic.

2. Select default device as the target in the properties dialog.

3. Place two command buttons on Form1.

4. Paste the following code into Form1:

   Const IDC_WAIT = 32514

   Public Declare Function LoadCursor Lib "Coredll" _
       Alias "LoadCursorW" ( _
       ByVal hInstance As Long, _
       ByVal lpCursorName As Long) As Long

   Public Declare Function SetCursor Lib "Coredll" ( _
       ByVal hCursor As Long) As Long

   Function WaitCursor(bWait As Boolean) As Long

       'Obtain the handle to the cursor
       If bWait Then
           'Get handle to the wait cursor
           hCursor = LoadCursor(0, IDC_WAIT)
       Else
           'Restore default cursor
           hCursor = LoadCursor(0, 0)
       End If
       
       'Set the cursor based on the cursor handle
       WaitCursor = SetCursor(hCursor)

   End Function

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
       WaitCursor True
   End Sub

   Private Sub Command2_Click()
       WaitCursor False
   End Sub

   Private Sub Form_Load()
       Command1.Caption = "Hourglass"
       Command2.Caption = "Default"
   End Sub

5. Run the application.

6. Click the command buttons and notice that the cursor changes.
