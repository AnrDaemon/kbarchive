TITLE   :Auditing Changes in SCM Not Reflected in User Manager Policies
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0 SP4,4.0 SP5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use the Security Configuration Manager (SCM) tool to remove
two auditing events that are being tracked for an attribute in User Manager for
Domains (for example, auditing Success and Failure events for the Audit Object
Access attribute), you can only remove one auditing event. If you are tracking
two auditing events for an attribute in User Manager for Domains on your Windows
NT 4.0-based computer, the SCM tool can add an auditing event successfully to
the tracking that is reflected in User Manager for Domains.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because of an incorrect flag set in the Local Security
Authority (LSA) server library.

RESOLUTION
