SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install the Windows NT Option Pack during the installation of
Microsoft BackOffice Server, the installation of Windows NT Option Pack may not
work and one or more of the following error messages may be displayed:

   
   ExAir Config Error(SetApplication - ExAir)
   An error occurred setting ExAir Web Applications details while creating app.
   The error is 1AD Activex component can't create object.

   ExAir Config Error (SetApplication - ExAir/Catalog)

   ExAir Error

   ExAir Error
   An error occurred while installing package 'TakeANumber'. The error is
   mteErrObjectErrors - see ErrorInfo collection

During the installation of Site Server, several error message dialog boxes may
appear with no text and just an OK command button.
In addition to the Option Pack and Site Server problems, the Intranet Publishing
Kit may also not install correctly.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Intranet Publishing Kit depends on Site Server,
which in turn depends on the Windows NT Option Pack. Windows NT Option Pack does
not install correctly if the account specified for the Microsoft Transaction
Server is not in the Administrators group.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

To prevent the above-mentioned problems from occurring, make sure the account
specified for the Microsoft Transaction Server is in the Administrators group.

1. Uninstall Site Server by running Site Server Setup from the Start menu. When
   you are prompted for the Site Server files, insert BackOffice CD #5.

2. Uninstall Windows NT Option Pack by running Setup.exe from the root folder on
   BackOffice CD #3.

3. Add the account that Transaction Server will use to the Administrators group
   using User Manager for Domains.

4. Run BackOffice Setup again and allow it to install Windows NT Option Pack,
   Site Server, and the Intranet Publishing Kit.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft BackOffice Server
version 4.5.
