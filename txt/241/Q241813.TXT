SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message may be logged in the Event log:

   Event log error:
   Event ID: 1106 - Source: SNMP
   The SNMP service is ignoring extension agent dll winnt\system32\w3pmib.dll
   because the file missing or incorrectly configured.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the SNMP service tries to load the W3pmib.dll
dynamic-link library (DLL), but cannot because the World Wide Web service
(W3svc) has not yet started. The W3pmib.dll DLL requires the World Wide Web
service (W3svc) to be running.


RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this issue, add the World Wide Web service (W3svc) to the Depend On
Service list for SNMP:

1. Use Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe, not Regedit.exe) to open the following
   key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\SNMP

2. Double-click Depend on Service.

3. Press ENTER to move to the next line (make sure that nothing is selected).

4. Type "W3SVC" (without the quotation marks). Do not press ENTER.

5. Click OK.

6. Restart the computer.
