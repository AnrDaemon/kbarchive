TITLE   :BUG: Source Browser Shows Decorated Name for Member Template
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbLangCPP kbVC600bug kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Source Browser shows the decorated name instead of the undecorated name for a
member template function.

CAUSE
=====

The underlying name decoration and undecoration scheme does not handle member
template functions correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Compile the following code with the Generate Browser Info option selected in
   Project Settings dialog box:

   class CC
   {
   public:
      
       template <typename K>
       K test(K k) { return k; }
   };

   int main()
   {
       CC c;
       int d=5;
       int i = c.test(d);
       return 0;
   }

2. On the Tools menu, click Source Browser.

3. In the Select Query list box, click Definitions And References.

4. Select the member template function test.

The following decorated name appears:

   ?test@CC@@QAE?AVtemplate-parameter-BAB@Vtemplate-parameter-BAB@@Z

NOTE: The same problem occurs if you use the BSC APIs from the Browser ToolKit.
