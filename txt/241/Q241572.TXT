The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Internet Connection Wizard (ICW) and you select the "I want to
set up a new connection on this computer" option, your roaming profile may not
be saved to the server.

CAUSE
=====

ICW calls the Telephony service to get user information. The Telephony service
opens a subkey of HKEY_CURRENT_USER by using the RegOpenKeyEx function, and then
closes the key when it is finished.

However, RegOpenKeyEx opens not only the subkey, but a predefined root key. In
this case, the root key is HKEY_CURRENT_USER. So, the HKEY_CURRENT_USER key is
still opened by the Telephony service, and Winlogon.exe cannot unload the
registry when you log off. Therefore, your roaming profile is not saved to the
server.
