TITLE   :FtpBrowseShowLongDate Only Operates at Master Property Level

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The FtpDirBrowseShowLongDate property indicates whether or not to display two or
four-digit years when you browse directories.

The Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 documentation states the following:

   This property [FtpDirBrowseShowLongDate] is accessible at the following
   locations:

   Metabase Path:

   /LM/MSFTPSVC
   /LM/MSFTPSVC/n
   /LM/MSFTPSVC/n/ROOT
   /LM/MSFTPSVC/n/ROOT/FtpVirtualDir

However, the documentation is incorrect. It is only possible to set the property
at the following locations:

   Metabase Path:

   /LM/MSFTPSVC
   /LM/MSFTPSVC/n/ROOT/FtpVirtualDir

Although, you can set the FtpDirBrowseShowLongDate property on an FTP virtual
directory (/LM/MSFTPSVC/n/ROOT/FtpVirtualDir), it is ignored when the metabase
is read. The FtpDirBrowseShowLongDate property can only be implemented for the
entire FTP service (/LM/MSFTPSVC).

RESOLUTION
==========

The FtpDirBrowseShowLongDate is only read and implemented from the /LM/MSFTPSVC
level in the metabase.

WARNING: Modifying the metabase incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall IIS 5.0. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from incorrectly modifying the metabase can be resolved. Modify the
metabase at your own risk.

Run the Adsutil.vbs utility from <%SYSTEMDRIVE%>\Inetpub\AdminScripts. When
you set the FtpDirBrowseShowLongDate property Adsutil.vbs set
/Msftpsvc/FtpDirBrowseShowLongDate <Value>, <Value> can be set to
TRUE or FALSE. A true value displays four-digit years and a false value display
two-digit years.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Services version 5.0.
