MORE INFORMATION

Page 1009: Multihomed Device Example Is Incorrect
-------------------------------------------------

On page 1009, the example for using the #MH keyword in the LMHOSTS doesn't use
the keyword #MH. You should also have different IP addresses for the two network
adapters.

Change:
102.54.94.91 accounting #accounting server NIC 1
102.54.94.91 accounting #accounting server NIC 2

To:
102.54.94.91 accounting #MH #accounting server NIC 1
102.54.95.91 accounting #MH #accounting server NIC 2


Page 1070:  Note Should Read Server Not Workstation
---------------------------------------------------

On page 1070, in the note, change both occurrences of Windows NT Workstation
Resource Kit, to Windows NT Server Resource Kit.

As noted in the README.wri file on the Windows NT Workstation Resource Kit
CD-ROM, Crystal Reports Event Log Viewer is included only on the Windows NT
Server Resource Kit.
