KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Migration Tool for NetWare (Nwconv.exe) to migrate Novell-based
servers to Windows NT, it does not provide a method to migrate printer queues.
Note that this behavior occurs even though this functionality is noted as
existing at the "Improving Netware to NT Migration" Microsoft Web site:

   http://support.microsoft.com/support/ntserver/migration/Improving.asp

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Migration Tool for NetWare does not provide a
method for migrating printer queues. The Web site listed earlier contains a
documentation error.
