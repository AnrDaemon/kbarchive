PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP3

KEYWORDS:exc55sp3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When users, who have mailboxes located on the Exchange Server computer on which
the MIME Internet X.400 Enhanced Relay (MIXER) is configured, send mail to an
X.400 recipient and an SMTP recipient, both recipients see the other one as if
the MIXER had not been invoked.

The X.400 recipient sees in the distribution list the SMTP recipient with
domain-defined attribute (DDA) type SMTP. The SMTP recipient sees in the
distribution list the X.400 recipient as (for example):
IMCEAX400-c=US+3Ba=+20+3Bp=MS+3Bo=PARIS+3Bs=user+3B@host.microsoft.com.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sections 4.2 and 4.3 of the Request for Comments (RFC) 2156 (MIXER) are included
in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3. RFC 2156 defines a way to automatically
map SMTP addresses to X.400 addresses and vice versa without the need of custom
recipient.

The MIXER is to be used on mail hubs where interconnectivity between X.400 and
SMTP is needed. It is not meant to be activated on a mailbox server.
