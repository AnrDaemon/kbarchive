TITLE   :Access to ProfileList Key Restricted
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following symptoms may occur:

 - When a user logs on to a computer running Windows NT 4.0, a profile other
   than the user's assigned profile may be loaded and may run malicious files
   placed in the StartUp folder. The user may be unaware that the profile
   substitution has taken place.

 - A normal domain user can add his or her account to the Domain Administrators
   group and obtain the permissions of that group by copying the profile to a
   self-deleting batch file and specifying the path to that file in the
   ProfileImagePath value in the Administrator's ProfileList key. The next time
   someone uses the Administrator account and password to log on, the batch file
   runs and adds that user's profile to the Domain Administrators group.

 - Users may be able to bypass mandatory profiles.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs in Windows NT 4.0 because the registry key listed below
grants the SetValue permission to the Everyone group by default, so that any
user (even guests) can edit the information in the ProfileList registry key and
its subkeys:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList

Editing these keys can be performed locally or remotely, and setting permissions
in the Access Control List (ACL) on the Winreg key (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System)
does not limit remote access because the path to the CurrentVersion key is an
allowed path and can be edited regardless of the permissions assigned to the
Winreg key.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you apply Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6 (SP6), the default permission on the
Everyone group is set to read access only. Also, the process created by
Winlogon.exe creates the user's Security Identifier (SID) subkey in the System
account, instead of under the CurrentVersion key, and then writes the necessary
values to the ProfileList key.

Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
----------------------------------------------
