MORE INFORMATION
================

CD-ROM: Audio Problems with Money Setup.AVI
-------------------------------------------

There are two audio problems with the Money Setup.avi file that is included on
the CD-ROM:

1. When you first play this file, the first word, "Welcome", is cut off.
2. The Money Setup.avi uses several different narrator voices. The last portion
   of the .avi switches to a male voice that can barely be heard, but not
   understood - even when the speaker volume is turned to its maximum.


Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
