TITLE   :Answer File for System Preparation Tool Is Not Removed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An answer file that is used by the Windows NT System Preparation tool
(Sysprep.exe) is not removed when the mini-Setup wizard is complete.

CAUSE
=====

If you use an answer file to automate the mini-Setup wizard, Sysprep.exe copies
the file to the %SystemRoot%\System32\$nt4pre$.inf file. When the mini-Setup
wizard starts, it looks for this file and uses it if it is present.

However, this file may contains the local administrator's password (if you
specify the "AdminPassword = <password> parameter. This password is
displayed in clear text.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, use any of the following methods:

 - Delete the file listed above after Setup is finished. The RunOnce registry
   keys do work with Sysprep, so you can use these keys to accomplish this task.

 - You can specify the administrator password you want to use before running
   Sysprep.exe. If you are automating the mini-Setup wizard by using an answer
   file, place the following parameter in the file:

   AdminPassword = "*"

This allows a blank administrator password. Because the password is not null
before you run Sysprep, the password remains unchanged.

 - Leave the "AdminPassword" key out of the answer file. Enter the password
   manually during the mini-Setup wizard.
