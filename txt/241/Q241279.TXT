TITLE   :SMS: Client Appears as Not Installed in Administrator Console
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbClient kbMMC kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbDiscovery kbsms200sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server clients may appear as 'not installed' in the
Administrator console, which may contradict their SMS client-based components
actual status. This status is displayed by clicking the Components tab in the
Systems Management Server tool in Control Panel.

Clients who were formally listed as 'installed' in the Administrator console may
revert to 'not installed' and their status may fluctuate.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the client computer has been turned off for more
than 24 hours before starting up and discovery may occur before the Client
Configuration Installation Manager has updated its heartbeat time.

Discovery determines whether the client is installed by checking if CCIM has
updated its heartbeat time within the last 24 hours.

If the client computer has been turned off for more than 24 hours, when it starts
up, Logon Discovery or CCIM itself may do discovery before the CCIM has updated
its heartbeat time. This causes discovery to report the client as not installed
(client = 0) in the Data Discovery Record (DDR). The DDR is then transferred to
the site server and added to the database.

In general, if the computer remains turned on, this incorrect value is corrected
the next time either logon discovery takes place or the next time CCIM writes a
heartbeat DDR to the Client Access point.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, use one of the following methods on the SMS site server.

Method 1: Using the Hotfix Installer
------------------------------------

NOTE: This method is only for I386-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a share on your network. Q241279.exe is a
   Microsoft Windows Installer file that updates specific files on your site
   server.

2. Log on to your site server using an account with administrative privileges.

3. On the site server, close the SMS Administrator console.

4. Run the Q241279.exe file and follow the directions in the wizard. The file
   can be run in Quiet mode using the /s switch.

Method 2: Manual installation
-----------------------------

1. Stop the SMS_EXECUTIVE and the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER services.

2. Replace the Clicore.exe file in the
   <Sms_root>\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base\<Platform> folder with the
   version obtained from the hotfix.

3. Replace the Compver.ini file in the <Sms_root>\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base
   folder with the version obtained from the hotfix.

4. Replace the Abnwcli.dll file in the <Sms_root>\Bin\<Platform>
   folder with the version obtained from the hotfix.

5. Replace the BindClin.dll file in the <Sms_root>\Bin\<Platform>
   folder with the version obtained from the hotfix.

6. Replace the NdsClin.dll file in the <SMS_root>\Bin\<Platform>
   folder with the version obtained from the hotfix.

7. Replace the Falclin.dll file in the <SMS_root>\Bin\<Platform>
   folder with the version obtained from the hotfix.

8. Replace the Mslmclin.dll file in the <SMS_root>\Bin\<Platform>
   folder with the version obtained from the hotfix.

9. Replace the Ccim32.dll file in the <SMS_root>\Bin\<Platform>
   folder with the version obtained from the hotfix.

10. Restart the SMS_EXECUTIVE and the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER services. Allow
   the updated Compver.ini, Clicore.exe, and Ccmcore.exe files to be propagated
   to all Logon points and Client Access Points in the site.

NOTE: The default Client Configuration Installation Manager (CCIM) polling
interval is 23 hours. Therefore, it may take up to 23 hours for the hotfixed
files to be propagated to the clients. To speed up this process, you can stop
and restart the SMS Client Service on each client. You can also create a
software distribution for one of the Resource Kit tools Setevnt.exe or
Cliutils.exe along with the appropriate parameter(s) to start a CCIM work cycle.
For information on the proper syntax to use with these tools, see the Resource
Kit documentation.
