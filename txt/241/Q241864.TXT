KEYWORDS:kbenv kbWinNT4sp6fix

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive "general protection fault" (GP fault) error messages when you
visit a secure Web site using transport layer security (TLS) 1.0 security. Note

The TLS protocol causes the server to send a list of trusted client Certificate
Authorities (CAs) to the client. In this case, the size of the list is larger
than the software can handle.
