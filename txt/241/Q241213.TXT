TITLE   :XFOR: Message Looping w/SNADS/PROFS/GroupWise/Notes Connectors
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a user of Microsoft Exchange 5.5 SNADS connector attempts to send a message
to a specific recipient, the SNADS system routes the message to the Exchange
Server organization. That specific recipient doesn't exist anywhere in the
Exchange Server global address list, and the node name of the SNADS address
isn't the node name in site addressing, where the address is in the format:
<node_name>(<user>).

CAUSE
=====

The receiving message transfer agent (MTA) attempts to route the message,
however, the only other route is through the SNADS connector on the other side.
The MTA routes the message out of the SNADS connector. The SNADS system receives
the message, routes back in, causing the message looping.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A new Exchconn.ini entry has been created that allows users to change this
behavior. The entry is called AllowUnresolvedAddresses and it should be put
under the [LME-SNADS-MEXIN] section in the Exchconn.ini file.

The default value is YES. Set it to NO if you do not want Exchange Server to
reject any recipient addresses that are not Exchange Server addresses.
Basically, Exchange Server does not accept 'One-Off' addresses if this is set to
NO.
