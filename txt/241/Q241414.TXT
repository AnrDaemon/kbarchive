TITLE   :NtSetInformationObject() Does Not Check Object Handle in C2SS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are processing a program with Microsoft C2 Security Services (C2SS) on
a computer running Windows NT 4.0, the NtSetInformationObject function does not
check to verify that a caller remains with the original handle and does not
change from a user-mode handle to a kernel-mode handle. Because of the upcoming
access-mode changes to object handles, it is important that
NtSetInformationObject perform this check for object handle protection.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT Server or Workstation 4.0
------------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or the
individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service

This problem was first corrected in Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6 and
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION

After you install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6 (SP6), the
NtSetInformationObject function maintains this checking process by passing
PreviousMode to the ObpSetHandleAttributes function and using a KERNEL OBJECT
flag in the object.
