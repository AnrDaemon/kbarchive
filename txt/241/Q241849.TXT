SUMMARY
=======

When compiling Interface Definition Language (IDL) code that has an OLE
automation dual interface with more than 110 methods, the Microsoft Interface
Definition Language (MIDL) compiler gives a MIDL2362 warning. The exact text of
the warning is as follows:

   warning MIDL2362 : too many methods in the interface, requires Windows NT 4.0
   SP3 or greater.

This happens on computers with Microsoft Windows NT and that have the latest
service pack installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The warning states that the number of methods in the dual interface is greater
than what Windows NT 4.0 without any service packs can support. If service pack
3 or higher is installed on the target Windows NT 4.0 computers, then the
warning can be ignored. The MIDL compiler does not check the service pack level
of Windows NT on the development computer. Therefore, the compiler gives the
warning if more than 110 methods are in the dual automation interface even if
SP3, SP4 or SP5 is on the development computer.

You can disable this warning if you use the following code before the offending
interface:

   #if (__midl >= 501)
   midl_pragma warning( disable: 2362 )
   #endif

This requires a version of Midl.exe that is 5.01.0000 or higher. You can check
the version of the MIDL compiler on the computer by running Midl.exe from the
command line.
