TITLE   :Removing Bypass Traverse Checking Causes Copy to Drop Streams
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbnetwork kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Files contained in Macintosh volumes contain streams (special data content) that
include data fork information. Files that do not contain stream information
appear to Macintosh clients as text-only files. The reported problem occurs
after copying a file from one directory to another. The copy operation could be
performed from the computer running Windows NT Server or by a Macintosh client;
it made no difference. After the copy operation, the target file stream was lost
and the file appeared to Macintosh clients as a text-only file.

This copy problem occurs on PDC or BDC servers, but not on a member server. It
also occurs when the Domain User Rights for "Bypass Traverse Checking" (the
default is Everyone) has been modified so no users are granted this right for
the Domain.

CAUSE
=====

NTFS was making a check that precluded the copying of the streams in the case
where "Bypass Traverse Checking" was removed from user rights.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, restore the Domain User Right: Bypass Traverse
Checking to Everyone.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
