TITLE   :SNA Server 3.0 Snadmod.dll Returns SEC_LOGON_FAILED_BADLY
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Client for Windows 95, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to SNA Server 3.0 with SNA Client for Windows 95,
the client may fail to connect and you receive the following error message:

   ERROR: No SNA Servers found in <Subdomain name>

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server Snadmod.dll returns a SEC_LOGON_FAILED_BADLY rather than
SEC_LOGON_FAILED_RETRY. The SEC_LOGON_FAILED_BADLY causes the Windows 95 client
to not retry the sponsor connection and to interpret the failure as an inability
to contact an SNA server.

RESOLUTION
==========

A change has been made to the SNA Server Snadmod.dll file to correctly send the
SEC_LOGON_FAILED_RETRY.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 3.0 and 3.0 Service
Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
