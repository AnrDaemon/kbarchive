PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::3.0,3.0b,5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbvfp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a 
 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the Help Compiler to compile a Microsoft Word 97 for Windows Rich Text
Format (RTF) file may produce the following error message:

   File is invalid

Other errors may appear indicating that the file is corrupt or that the Help file
cannot be created.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Word 97 for Windows uses a different RTF file format than earlier
versions of Microsoft Word.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the updated Help Workshop version 4.03.0002 that is available for download
from the Internet (anonymous FTP) site listed below in the More Information
section.

There is also a Help Workshop version 4.02 that compiles Word 97 RTF files. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q164012 WD97: Error Message: 'The RTF File .\ Is Corrupted at Offset...'


If access to either of the newer help compilers is not available, Microsoft Word
95 or an earlier version of Microsoft Word can be used to create the RTF file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To obtain a version of the Help compiler, download Hcwsetup.exe, a
self-extracting file, from the following ftp address:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/softlib/mslfiles/

Select the file entitled Hcwsetup.exe and save it to a folder on your hard drive.
Once copied to the hard drive, open Explorer and double-click the .exe file to
begin the self-extraction process.
