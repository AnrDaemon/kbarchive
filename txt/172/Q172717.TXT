======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience either of the following symptoms:

 - When you start Windows 95, you receive the following error message:

   MSPSRV - <Printer Name>
   Error FFh Attaching to NetWare Server <Server Name>

 - When you click OK on the Print Server tab in the properties for a printer
   using the Microsoft Print Agent for NetWare Networks (MSPSRV), the computer
   stops responding (hangs). When you restart the computer, you may receive the
   error message listed above.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Print Agent for NetWare Networks is attempting to connect to a
NetWare version 4.0 or earlier server. The connection is denied because the
NetWare user license limit has been reached.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MSPSRV uses a connection to the NetWare server. This connection is in addition
to any other connections that may already exist between the Windows 95 client
and the NetWare server (whether user or other MSPSRV connections).
