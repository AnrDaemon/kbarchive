TITLE   :FTP Clients Cannot Rename Files on Remote FTP Virtual Directory
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to an FTP virtual directory that points to a remote Microsoft
Windows NT Server (using either an NTFS or FAT partition), you can not rename a
file that resides in that directory, even if you have full control to the share
or NTFS permissions. When you try to rename the file, you will get the following
error message:

   Error 500: Access is denied.

All other actions can be completed as expected (put, get, delete). Also, a file
located in a local virtual directory may be successfully renamed.

CAUSE
=====

The FTP protocol has a two step rename process. The first, RNFR (Rename From),
does not attempt to impersonate the UNC user when checking file attributes.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
