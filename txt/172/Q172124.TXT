TITLE   :Poledit.exe Not Updated During WinNT SP3 Installation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3), you find that the file
Poledit.exe has not been replaced as documented in the following Microsoft
Knowledge Base article:

   Q162774 Policy Editor Crashes When Using Large Custom ADM Files

CAUSE
=====

The file Poledit.exe is listed under the section [MustReplace.System32.files] in
the Service Pack 3 Update.inf file. Whereas poledit is actually installed in the
SystemRoot directory by default.

Poledit.exe should go under the [SystemRoot.files] section in the Update.inf
file.

The service pack is designed to only replace files that are currently installed
on the system, since Update.exe looked for the Poledit.exe file in the System32
directory and was not found, it did not copy it.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Expand the Windows NT Service Pack 3 Update.exe file in a separate directory
   using the /X Switch: NT4SP3_I.EXE /X

2. Copy Poledit.exe from the folder created in step 1 to the %SystemRoot%
   folder.

NOTE: Alternately, you can modify the SP3 update.inf file and move the file
poledit.exe from the [MustReplace.System32.files] to the [SystemRoot.files]
section. This will allow future SP3 installation to correctly replace the
Poledit.exe file. To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for
Windows NT 4.0 or Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional
information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
