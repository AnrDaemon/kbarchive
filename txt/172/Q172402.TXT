TITLE   :Auditing Logon Failures Does Not Log Remote Failures
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Not all failure events are recorded when User Manager for Domains is set to
audit logon and logoff failures.

CAUSE
=====

If a user fails to logon locally, the Event Viewer System Log records an event
529 (Logon Failure). However, if a Remote User fails to log on to the domain, no
event is recorded. The account is locked out if configured to do so, but no
event is recorded.


RESOLUTION
==========

If you are using Windows NT 4.0, to resolve this issue, see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q182918 Account Lockout Event also Stored in Security Event Log on DC

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.51 and
4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
