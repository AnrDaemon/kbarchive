TITLE   :Snatrace Doesn't Set Global Trace Properties on Remote Computer
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Snatrace.exe allows you to capture traces on remote computers that are running
SNA Server or SNA Client software. The command is:

   "snatrace.exe \\ <Server Name>" (without the quotation marks)

When you are configuring Snatrace.exe to capture traces on a remote computer, the
global trace properties on that computer are not affected by changing these
values at the local computer.

CAUSE
=====

The global tracing flags are not being properly set in the registry.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
