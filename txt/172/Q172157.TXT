TITLE   :PRB: Do Not Use SourceSafe When Running SSARC or SSRESTO
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe500 kbSSafe600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the archiving or restore utilities SSARC and SSRESTOR while users are
working in Visual SourceSafe, the archive or restore may fail. Database
corruption may also occur.

We recommend that every user log out of the Visual SourceSafe Database before you
use the SSARC or SSRESTOR utilities.

CAUSE
=====

SSARC and SSRESTOR can write or remove many files from the Visual SourceSafe
database, depending on the scope of its operation. If other users are in the
process of making changes to log files that the archive and restore utilities
need, unpredictable results may occur.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
