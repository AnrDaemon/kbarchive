TITLE   :EBCDIC 0xB5 Not Mapped by PDT File
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Character Definition section in the PDT file fails to map the EBCDIC 0xB5
character to a new value.

CAUSE
=====

The Host Code Page (037) converts EBCDIC 0xB5 to ASCII 0xA7 (ASCII section
symbol character). The PDF operation code mapping table incorrectly links
Section_Symbol with 0xFE. Consequently, 0xB5, after being converted to 0xA7, has
no matching entry in the PDT file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, the PDF operation code for SECTION_SYMBOL is changed so
that it links correctly to ASCII 0xA7.
