TITLE   :Snacfg.exe "USER /INSERT" Fails Adding Additional LU
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11,3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Snacfg.exe to assign an LU to a username, the first attempt
completes successfully. When you try to add and assign additional LUs to a user
through Snacfg.exe, the command fails with the error message:

   User <username> Not Found.

If you attempt to assign the username and LU again using Snacfg.exe it completes
successfully, and in both Snacfg.exe and SNA Manager the user shows up twice
with DOMAINNAME\<username> with one configured LU for each.


CAUSE
=====

Snacfg.exe does not parse the username entry correctly and only allows a single
LU to be assigned to a user.

RESOLUTION
==========

Snacfg.exe has been fixed and now requires that you either prefix the username
to be assigned an LU with the DOMAINNAME or use the /DOMAIN option. You can now
successfully assign additional LUs to the same username without creating a new
account.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 3.0 and 3.0 Service
Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
