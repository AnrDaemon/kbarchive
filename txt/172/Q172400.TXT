======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 1.52 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

ClassWizard generated applications created in Visual C++ versions 2.0 and later
give the user the ability to override some MFC virtual functions through the
ClassWizard interface. However, ClassWizard projects converted to Visual C++
32-bit edition from Visual C++ 16-bit edition do not have this ability.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To reproduce this problem:

1. Start Visual C++, 16-bit edition, and create an AppWizard-generated
   application.

2. Close Visual C++, 16-bit edition.

3. Start Visual C++, 32-bit edition.

4. From the File menu, open the 16-bit project's make file by selecting Open in
   Visual C++ 2.x, or Open Workspace in Visual C++ 4.0 and later. Visual C++
   will ask if you want to convert the make file. Click yes.

5. Start ClassWizard. From the dialog box, choose the CWinApp-derived class name
   from the Class Name list box, then choose the CWinApp-derived class name from
   the Object IDs list box. Notice that no messages are listed in the Messages
   list box.

6. Close this project and create a new AppWizard-generated application in Visual
   C++ versions 2.0 and later. Repeat step 5. Notice the overridable functions
   available to the CWinApp-derived class in ClassWizard.
