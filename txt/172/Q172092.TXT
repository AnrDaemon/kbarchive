KEYWORDS:winword word97 kbwdinternet

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you insert an image into an HTML document and use the ALIGN property of the
IMG tag to right align it, all HTML code after the image is removed from the
saved HTML file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, right align the paragraph that contains the image,
instead of aligning the image. To do this, view the HTML source by saving your
document, and then clicking HTML Source on the View menu.

Locate the line that contains ALIGN=RIGHT as part of the IMG SRC tag, and change
it to align the paragraph. For example, if your file contains the following
line

   <P><A HREF="INDEX.HTML"><IMG SRC="IMAGE.JPG"
   ALIGN=RIGHT></A></P>

change it to this

   <P ALIGN="RIGHT"><A HREF="INDEX.HTML"><IMG
   SRC="IMAGE.JPG"></A></P>
