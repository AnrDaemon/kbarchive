TITLE   :FIX: SSARC & SSRESTOR Do Not Store Macintosh Resource Fork Data
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe500bug kbVS97sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using SSARC and SSRESTOR to archive and restore files from a database that
has Macintosh SourceSafe clients and stores Macintosh files, the file's resource
fork is not included as part of the archive. Restoring the archive to another
database causes resource fork information to be lost. Attempting to get or
checkout these files on a Macintosh client produces the following error
message:

   File '<path>:<filename>' not found where <filename> has
   either a .c or a .d extension.

CAUSE
=====

SSARC and SSRESTOR do not make use of the information stored in files with the
.c or .d extension in the SourceSafe database. These files contain the resource
fork information for Macintosh files.

RESOLUTION
==========

It is possible to copy the Macintosh resource fork information to the restored
database. SSARC & SSRESTOR may re-map the physical filenames when archiving
from one database and restoring into another database. The following steps can
be used to copy the resource fork information:

1. Find the physical name of the file in the old database.

2. Copy the old .c or .d file.

3. Find the new physical file name for the file in the restored to database.

4. Rename the old .c or .d file to the new physical file name.

5. Place the renamed file in the appropriate subdirectory in the restored to
   SourceSafe Database.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service
Pack 3.
