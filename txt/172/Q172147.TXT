The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to browse for printers using the Add Printer Wizard and
selecting Network Printer Server and choosing Next, the Connect to Printer
dialog box may stop responding (hang). The status displays "Working..." but
control never returns to the user.

CAUSE
=====

The above symptom may occur for one of the following reasons:

 - Creation of null printer shares on the print server

   NullSessionShares can be added for Downlevel print clients who may not have
   an account or because of a conflicting account. For more information on
   NullSessionShares, please see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
   article:

   Q121853 Downlevel Print Jobs Not Redirected Correctly

 - Domain names containing a comma (,) in the first character position.


RESOLUTION
==========

Winspool.drv has been redesigned to take these queues into account when browsing
the domain for printers.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
