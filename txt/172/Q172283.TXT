   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

A blank page is printed between each print job.

CAUSE
=====

If the host or AS/400 initiates and ends a print job without sending any printer
data, the SNA Print Server opens and closes the Windows NT printer. This results
in a blank page being printed. If these empty print jobs separate the actual
print jobs, blank pages are printed between each job.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, SNA Print Server allows a delay in opening the printer
until the SNA Print Server receives printable data. To implement the fix, you
need to edit the registry as follows:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe or Regedit.exe as appropriate for your
   version of Windows NT).

2. Go to the following key in the registry:

HKEY_LOCAL_ MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaPrint\ 
Parameters

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value and use the following entry:

   "Value Name: DelayPrintStart
   Data Type: REG_SZ
   Value: YES" (without the quotation marks)

4. Exit Registry Editor.
