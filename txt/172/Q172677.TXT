SYMPTOMS

In Microsoft Word 97, when you create an appeal brief using the Pleading wizard,

not available in the Pleading wizard that ships with Microsoft Word 97. It was
added to the Pleading wizard that ships with Microsoft Word 97, Service Release
1.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, Service Release
1.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, Service Release 1.

MORE INFORMATION
