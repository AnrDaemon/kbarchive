TITLE   :Request Definite Response Doesn't Signal When Job Sent
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the Monitor Job, Request Definite Response option is selected in a printer
session's property page, the definite response message is sent to the host when
the print job has handed it to the Windows NT spooler. This is not the expected
behavior. Instead, the definite response message should be sent when Windows NT
has been notified by the physical printer that the job has completed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0 Service
Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
