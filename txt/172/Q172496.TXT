TITLE   :Windows 95 Client Config Utility Incorrectly Updates Check Box
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You are running the SNA Windows 95 Client configuration utility. On the Advanced
tab, you select or clear the "Use Windows NT domain password" check box. If you
then click a different tab, the change you made to the "Use Windows NT domain
password" check box disappears. If you look at the Advanced tab again, you will
see that the "Use Windows NT domain password" check box has reverted to its
previous state.

CAUSE
=====

The Advanced page of the Windows 95 SNA Client configuration utility re- reads
the registry after having been previously initialized. It then drops the change
to the "Use Windows NT domain password" check box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,

MORE INFORMATION
================

To reproduce this problem:

1. Start the SNA Windows 95 Client configuration utility and click the Advanced
   tab.

2. Change the "Use Windows NT domain password" check box to a different status;
   that is, if it is checked, clear it, and if it is cleared, select it.

3. Click the About tab.

4. Click the Advanced tab again. The "Use Windows NT domain password" check box
   status will have reverted to the selected state.

With the fix applied, the client configuration utility does not re-read the
registry for its settings after being initialized the first time.
