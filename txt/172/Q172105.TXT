TITLE   :FIX: NewPage Method Followed by EndDoc Method Prints Blank Page
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a call is made to the EndDoc method of the Printer Object (or the application
is closed) after having issued the NewPage method, a page is ejected from the
printer regardless of whether any actual printing has taken place.

This is contrary to the behavior of Visual Basic 4.0, as well as the online Help
in Visual Basic 5.0 for the EndDoc method, which states the following:

   If EndDoc is invoked immediately after the NewPage method, no additional
   blank page is printed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work-around this problem, do not call the NewPage method until you know you
are going to print something on the page.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Basic 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new project.

2. Add a CommandButton to Form1.

3. Add the following code to Form1:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            Printer.Print "Page 1"
            Printer.NewPage
            Printer.EndDoc
         End Sub

4. Press the F5 key to run the project.

5. Click the button. Note that two pages are printed. The first page prints as
   expected, but it is followed by a blank page.
