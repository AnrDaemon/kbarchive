TITLE   :Sharing Violation with Server-side Includes

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to modify or replace a file that is being called as a server-side
Include, you may get a sharing violation. You also may not be able to delete,
move, rename, or change this file until the World Wide Web (WWW) service is
stopped.

CAUSE
=====

Generally all files published by the World Wide Web Publishing service are
shared, and can be updated at any time with no problem, even on a busy server.
The exception is with server side includes. The file called by the server-side
Include tag is mapped into memory and is not shareable. This can prevent the
file from being updated without stopping the WWW service.

Normally this is not a problem, but if the included file is used to display
frequently changing information, then it would cause the WWW service to have to
be stopped and started more often than normal.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you have dynamically changing data, you should not use a server-side Include
to display the information from a file.
