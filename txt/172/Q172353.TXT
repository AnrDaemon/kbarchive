The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

The startup value for a network adapter in Control Panel Devices should be set
to AUTOMATIC. Setting the value to SYSTEM or BOOT may cause the system to trap
with a STOP:0x0000001E upon system restart.

Behavior may vary from one network card to another.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You may use the LastKnownGood configuration to get into the system as this will
use the configuration prior to the changed setting, or remove the network card
from the system. This will cause the driver to fail to load and once back into
the system, use the default startup value as configured with adapter
installation.

Additional query words: 0x1E
