MORE INFORMATION
================

Online Book Does Not Have Search Feature
----------------------------------------

The back cover of "Running Microsoft Excel 97" states that you can "Find
information fast with a searchable version of the book on disc."

The online version of "Running Microsoft Excel 97" provides you with an interface
that will allow you to browse through the Table of Contents of the book and
locate the section you are interested in. Hyperlinks also allow the user to
quickly jump to related topics throughout the book. However, there is no
"Search" button or feature in the book.

Correction:
Back Cover, 2nd-to-last bullet:
Change: "Find information fast with a searchable version of the book on disc."
To: "Find information fast with an online version of the book."


Page 1025: Triangle Function Returns Errors
-------------------------------------------

In Microsoft Excel 97, running the Triangle function code on page 1025 returns an
error for these calls on page 1026:

        =Triangle(,4,5) 
        =Triangle(3,,5) 
        =Triangle(A4,B4,C4)

Microsoft Excel 97 will return #VALUE? as the value for the cell. This is caused
by a problem with the IsMissing function in Microsoft Excel 97. The Triangle
function expects IsMissing to return True when the value of the variant is Null.
On computers affected by this problem, IsMissing will always return False
whether or not the variant is Null. Consequently, the function does not evaluate
correctly.

Because of the structure of the function, the only arguments that will evaluate
correctly are:

        =Triangle(arg1,arg2)

Microsoft Press is currently researching this problem and will post further
information when it becomes available.
