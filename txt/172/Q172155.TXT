TITLE   :BUG: Decimal Values Missing from Internet Search Wizard Results
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Internet Search Wizard to query against numeric data in FoxPro
tables, decimal places will be truncated in the results.

RESOLUTION
==========

In order for the decimal values to be displayed properly, the STR() function
must be used in the SELECT statement in the IDC file. The IDC file may be edited
in a text editor such as Notepad.

For example, the following IDC file that was generated by the Internet Search
Wizard has been modified to include the STR() function for numeric fields
(Numfield1 and Numfield2):

      Datasource:
      Template: TEST.HTX
      SQLStatement:
      +SELECT  Field1, Field2, STR(Numfield1,10,2), STR(Numfield2,10,2)
      + FROM 'TEST'
      + WHERE ID = '%SearchParam%'
      Maxrecords: 10

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
