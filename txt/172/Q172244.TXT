Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start a New AddIn Project in Visual Basic 5.0.

2. Add the following line to the Private Sub OKButton_Click() in frmAddIn:

         VBInstance.VBProjects(1).VBComponents.Add (vbext_ct_MSForm)

3. Type "ADDTOINI" in the Immediate (debug) window and press the ENTER key.

4. Press the F5 key to run the project.

5. Start another instance of Visual Basic with a new standard EXE project*.

6. Under Add-Ins menu, select Add-In Manager, and then select My AddIn from the
   list.

7. Under Add-Ins menu, select My AddIn item.

8. Click OK on the Add-In Form. You will get:

   Run-time error '-2147467259 (800004005)': System Error
   &h80004005(-2147467259). Unspecified error.

9. Add a new form to the add-in project and save it in the 'Template' folder
   under Visual Basic folder as Form1.frm (for example, 'C:\Program
   Files\DevStudio\VB\Template', and then remove the form from the project.

10. Change the code:

         VBInstance.VBProjects(1).VBComponents.Add (vbext_ct_MSForm)

   in step 6 to:

         VBInstance.VBProjects(1).VBComponents.AddFromTemplate _
         ("C:\Program Files\DevStudio\VB\Template\Form1.frm")

11. Repeat steps 3 through 8. This time a form should be added to your project
   each time you click OK.

* If your project does not have a form, you will get 'Run-time error #9,
subscript out of range.'
