TITLE   :Print LU Status Remains Pending If SNAPRINT Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1), of a UNC
(universal naming convention) path for a print session is specified and the
printer is not installed on the server, Snaprint.exe fails and causes the print
session to remain in a pending state rather than returning to inactive.

CAUSE
=====

The Snaprint Service assumes that any printer to which it has access will have a
port name set up for it. Print Server will fail if the WinvprtStartJob() or
WinvprtOpenPrinter() fails to find the port name for the defined printer.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Winvprt.dll and Ppd3270.dll files have been changed. When a port name is not
detected, an error is logged and the status of the print LU returns to inactive
instead of remaining in a pending state.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 3.0 and 3.0 Service
Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the

MORE INFORMATION
================

The remote printer must exist in the domain (and be installed) or the print
session transitions to inactive without trapping.
