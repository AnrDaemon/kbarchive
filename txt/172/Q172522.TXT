TITLE   :PRB: Unattended Install Does Not Stop After Text Mode
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbOPK kbSBK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use NoWaitAfterTextMode = 0 in the [Unattend] section of your
Unattend.txt file to stop the installation after text mode, the installation may
not stop. Create a 500 MB partition and place the entry ExtendOEMPartition = 1
in the Unattend.txt file.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q143473 Unattended Setup Stops Unexpectedly


CAUSE
=====

This happens when the Unattend.txt file contains the entry:

   [unattend]
   FileSystem = ConvertNTFS

This entry causes the computer to restart in order to complete the conversion of
the file system to NTFS.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
