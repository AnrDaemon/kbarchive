-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a WordArt or AutoShape object in an HTML document, a blank Word
picture object is opened.

NOTE: This problem occurs whether you use the Insert menu or the Drawing toolbar
to insert the WordArt or AutoShape object.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is a design limitation of the OLE implementation of inserting a
picture object in an HTML document.

This problem occurs after the Web Page Authoring Tools Update is installed. The
version of the Web Page Authoring Tools Update is 3.0.4405.0. To check the
version of the HTML Update in Word, follow these steps:

1. In Word, open an HTML document.

2. On the Help menu, click About Microsoft Word.

3. Click System Info.

4. Click Active Modules.

5. Under Module Name, find HTML and note the version number.

If the version number is 3.0.4405.0, you have the Web Page Authoring Tools Update
installed.

NOTE: This behavior does not occur in Word 2000.

WORKAROUND
==========

When you are in the blank picture object, use one of the following methods:

 - To insert a WordArt object, click the Insert WordArt button again.

   -or-

 - To insert an AutoShape object, click the AutoShape button again, point to the
   style of AutoShape, and then click the AutoShape you want. Draw the AutoShape
   in the blank Word Picture object as you want.

NOTE: After inserting the WordArt or AutoShape object in the blank Word Picture
object, you must click the Reset Picture Boundary button on the Edit Picture
toolbar before you click Close Picture.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you install the Web Page Authoring Tools Update, two new options will be
installed on the Insert menu when you point to Picture. Both WordArt and
AutoShape will be available to insert into an HTML document. These objects
cannot exist in an HTML document without being contained in a picture object.
