TITLE   :XCLN: Changing the Binding Order Of the Macintosh Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can change the binding order of the Microsoft Exchange client for Macintosh
by editing the Exchange Preference file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Exchange Preference file is located in System Folder/Extensions. Copy the
file for safekeeping by using the Command-D keystroke combination.

WARNING: Using ResEdit incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require
you to reinstall Microsoft Exchange Client for the Macintosh. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of ResEdit can be
solved. Use ResEdit at your own risk. Make a backup of your file before
attempting to make changes.

Run ResEdit against the file, and open the STR# (Strings) resource. Open String
ID 130 "Exchange provider." String 2 is the RPC binding order. Cut and paste to
put NCACN_IP_TCP (TCP/IP) first in the binding order.

This change can often speed connection to the Exchange Server computer in strict
TCP/IP environments. Also, by removing NCACN_AT_DSP (AppleTalk) you may prevent
the Macintosh client from ever using AppleTalk for connecting to the Exchange
Server computer.
