TITLE   :Failure to Open Domain Error Displayed Too Soon By Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When trying to open SNA Server subdomains, SNA Server Manager may display a

   Failed to Open Domain

error message prematurely. The SNAOLE error message pops up stating that the
domain could not be found but then the domain is opened normally.

CAUSE
=====

When trying to find the SNA Server configuration file path, a call is made to
the SNA Server DMOD (SNADMOD.DLL). If the DMOD is locked doing an Open
connection which times out, the call does not return for a while. This call has
a timeout of 10 seconds, after which the "Failed to Open Domain" message was
displayed.

RESOLUTION
==========

An update has been made that increases the timeout for the call to find the SNA
Server configuration file path to 60 seconds to reduce the likelihood of this
problem occurring. During this 60 seconds, SNA Server Manager is unable to
respond to user input.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server, versions
3.0 and 3.0 SP1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
