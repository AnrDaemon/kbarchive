MORE INFORMATION
================

To create a new OST, perform the following steps:

1. Exit and log out of the Exchange Client,

2. Rename any existing OST files with an "xxx" extension.

3. Restart the Exchange Client online. (The profile may need to be changed if
   the client is set to start offline.)

4. When you are prompted with: "The file "C:\XXXX\XXX.OST could not be found,"
   click OK.

5. You will then be prompted with the Offline Folder File Settings dialog box.

6. Click OK (or change the path and/or the OST filename if desired).

7. When you are prompted with "The file c:\xxx\xxx.ost could not be found. Would
   you like to create it," Click YES.

8. The Exchange Client will start online. Select Synchronize - All folders from
   the Tools menu.

The new offline folder is now synched with the server. The client may be started
offline at this point with the new OST file.
