TITLE   :Change Made to Enable 3270 SSO Does Not Set Out-Of-Date Flag
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the SNA Server Service is active and you make a change by selecting or
clearing the "Enable 3270 Single Sign-On" check box via Host Security Domains
(new with SNA Server 3.0 SP1), the SNA Server Service will not show "Out of
Date" after the configuration is saved.

Although it appears that this change happens dynamically by the node, the change
does not take place until the SNA Server Service is stopped and then restarted.

CAUSE
=====

The "Out of Date" flag is not being set on the SNA Server when a change is made
to the "Enable 3270 Single Sign-On" check box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, the SNA Server is updated and flagged "Out of Date" when
this option is changed.
