SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to re-create a Macintosh volume on a computer running
Windows NT Server version 3.51 or 4.0. You may want to recreate a Macintosh
share if you need to change the name of the share or if you are experiencing
problems with the volume.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To re-create a Macintosh volume, you need to first remove the volume:

NOTE: Removing the Macintosh volume will not remove any previously established
permissions, however, if different permissions are chosen during the creation of
the volume, the existing permissions may be replaced.

1. In Windows NT 3.51, start File Manager.

   In Windows NT 4.0, on the Start menu, click Run. Type "WINFILE" (without the
   quotation marks), and then click OK.

2. Click Remove Volumes from the MacFile menu.

3. Select the volume you want to remove, and then click OK.

The next step is to re-create the Macintosh volume:

1. In File Manager, select Create Volume from the MacFile menu.

2. Type the new or old volume name, depending on which you prefer to use.

3. Assign permissions as needed and select the appropriate Volume Security and
   User Limit.

4. Click OK.

The Macintosh volume has been re-created and Macintosh clients should now have
access to it.
