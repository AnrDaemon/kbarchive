TITLE   :Service Control Manager Reports Error But No Event ID Is Listed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINDOWS NT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows NT 4.0, you may receive the following error message:

   At Least One Service or Driver Failed During System Startup. Use Event Viewer
   to Examine the Event Log for Details.

When you check Event Viewer, there are no error messages.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if a driver does not start correctly but does not report
errors to the Event Log service.

One driver that exhibits this behavior is the UMAX scanner driver (UMAXDRV). If
the scanner is turned off, the driver does not load, which causes the error
message. However, the driver does not report the failure to the Event Log
service.

RESOLUTION
==========

Either resolve the issue that caused the driver not to load successfully (for
example, turn on the scanner before booting) or disable the driver by following
these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Devices.

2. Click the driver, and then click Startup.

3. Click Disabled, and then click OK.

4. Click Close.
