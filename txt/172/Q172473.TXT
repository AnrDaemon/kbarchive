======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run ScanDisk or Disk Defragmenter, the operation may restart when only
a small percentage of the operation is finished and then continue to restart
repeatedly, or the operation may take a very long time.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if Hewlett-Packard ScanJet Button Manager is running in
the background.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, quit ScanJet Button Manager before you run ScanDisk
or Disk Defragmenter. To quit ScanJet Button Manager, press CTRL+ALT+DELETE to
open the Close Program dialog box, click Hpsjbmgr in the list of running
programs, and then click End Task.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Disabling ScanJet Button Manager does not disable scanning, but it does disable
one-touch scanning. For more information about ScanJet Button Manager, please
contact Hewlett-Packard.
