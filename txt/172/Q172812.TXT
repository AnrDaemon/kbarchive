TITLE   :XADM: Event ID 9031 Database Resource Failure Error -1011
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following events may appear in the application Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 9031
   Source: MSExchangeIS
   Type: Error
   Category: None
   Description: Database Resource Failure error -1011 occured in function
   JTAB_BASE::EcSeek while accessing the database.

When attempting to do some client functions you may get also get the error
message:

   Client operation failed.

When selecting F2 on the error dialog box, the following error message appears:

   Microsoft Exchange Server Information Store -- 1281 -- [80000008:FFFFFC0D].

When the same exact operation is retried, the operation is successful.

CAUSE
=====

The buffers for the Microsoft Exchange Server directory and information store
are set too low. Operations are failing because the directory or information
store cannot obtain the resources to open a new session with the JET database
intermittently.

RESOLUTION
==========

Re-run the Microsoft Exchange Server Performance Optimizer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Performance Optimizer uses internal algorithms to set a variety of Exchange
Server values. Some of these algorithms changed slightly in the Exchange Server
4.0a Service Pack 2 release. So re-running Performance Optimizer from a version
of Exchange Server later than 4.0a SP2 will recalculate some of these
performance values even if there are no changes to physical memory, number of
users, and so on.

The store and directory buffers are basically pools of memory for either of these
services. Each time the information store or the directory opens a session with
the JET database, it needs to pull from its buffer to allocate memory. If there
are not enough buffers on a busy server, you receive out-of-memory errors
(1011).

Re-running the Performance Optimizer significantly increases the buffers and
subsequently, the 9031 events stop being generated.

After re-running Exchange Server Performance Optimizer, the log file Perfopt.log
shows a dramatic increase in the Set # of information store buffers and
directory buffers similar to the following:

   Set # of information store buffers from 9330 to 20000
   Set # of directory buffers from 3110 to 7915
