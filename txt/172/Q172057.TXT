TITLE   :FIX: CreateDragImage Method in ListView Uses Wrong Icon
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When dragging a selection from the ListView control, the icon for the first item
in the list is displayed during the drag operation. This problem occurs when the
CreateDragImage method is used.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, it is necessary to extract the correct icon from
the image list that provides the icons for the ListView. For example, if the
original line of code reads:

      ListView1.DragIcon = ListView1.SelectedItem.CreateDragImage

change it to read:

      ListView1.DragIcon= _
      ImageList1.ListImages(ListView1.SelectedItem.Index).ExtractIcon

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Basic 6.0.

================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new "Standard EXE" project.

2. On the default form, place an ImageList, a ListView, and a label.

3. Set the View property of the ListView control to "2-lvwList."

4. Place the following code in the Forms module:

      Dim itmX As ListItem

      Private Sub Form_Load()
      Dim i As Integer
      ListView1.Icons = ImageList1
      ListView1.SmallIcons = ImageList1
      For i = 1 To 4
         Set itmX = ListView1.ListItems.Add(i, , "List item " + Str(i), i, i)
      Next
      End Sub

      Private Sub ListView1_MouseDown(Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, _
         x As Single, y As Single)
      Set itmX = ListView1.SelectedItem ' Set the item being dragged.
      End Sub

      Private Sub listView1_MouseMove(Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, _
         x As Single, y As Single)
      If Button = vbLeftButton Then ' Signal a Drag operation.
         Label1.Caption = ListView1.SelectedItem 'Check which item is selected
         ListView1.DragIcon = ListView1.SelectedItem.CreateDragImage
         'workaround
         'ListView1.DragIcon = _
         '  ImageList1.ListImages(ListView1.SelectedItem.Index).ExtractIcon
         ListView1.Drag vbBeginDrag ' Drag operation.
     End If
     End Sub

5. Run the project.

6. Drag a selection from the ListView. Note that the icon used for the drag
   operation is always the first icon in the ListView control.
