TITLE   :SNA Manager Traps When Editing LUA Properties TN3270 Tab
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the TN3270 tab of the LUA properties dialog box, there is an
exception error in SNA Manager. A Drwtsn32.log file is generated.

CAUSE
=====

If a connection is deleted, a call is made to Snacfg.dll, which deletes all of
the LU records, whether they are assigned to the TN3270 servers or not. The LU
needs to be removed with a DestroyConfig() call similar to that which occurs
when an LU is deleted individually.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, a change is made to the Snacfg.dll file and Snaadmin.dll
file so that a DestroyLU() and DestroyConfig() make the same type of deletion
call.

To reproduce this problem:

1. Create two connections.

2. On each connection create an LUA LU.

3. Assign both LUA LUs to the TN3270 Server.

4. Save the configuration and exit the SNA Manager.

5. Restart the SNA Manager.

6. Delete one of the connections.

7. Re-create the connection and insert a new LUA LU.

8. Do not save the configuration.

9. Select the TN3270 Server, right-click the TN3270 LUA LU, and click
   Properties.

10. Click the TN3270 tab of the LUA LU's properties window and the exception
   occurs. A Drwtsn32.log file is generated.
