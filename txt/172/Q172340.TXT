KEYWORDS:kbenv kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you add additional RAM to your Windows NT system you may receive the error
message:

   STOP C0000221 - Bad Image Checksum the image comctl32.dll is possibly
   corrupt, the header checksum does not match the computed checksum.

The filename may be different and may change on subsequent restarts.

CAUSE
=====

A corrupt pagefile may be the cause of this error, or bad or incompatible
memory.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Return the system to the original RAM configuration. If you have a FAT
   partition, boot to DOS, and delete the Pagefile.sys. If you have an NTFS
   partition, try to log back on as administrator.


2. Click the Start button, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
   double-click the System icon.

3. From the System Properties dialog box, click the Performance tab, and then
   click Change in the Virtual Memory section.

4. From the Virtual Memory dialog box, select the individual Drive(s) the
   pagefiles are on, and set the Initial Size and the Maximum Size of the
   pagefile(s) to 0. Do not restart the system.

5. Run CHKDSK C: /F /R; run on any drive that contained a pagefile. If you have
   multiple pagefiles, perform the CHKDSK on non-system partitions first,
   because running CHKDSK on the system partition requires a restart.

6. Restart the system.

7. Set the pagefile to an optimal level for the amount of RAM you will add. For
   more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
   Base:

   Q99768 Optimizing Your Paging File (PAGEFILE.SYS)

8. Shutdown the system and add your RAM, the RAM added should follow the
   specifications for the hardware it is being added too. All speeds and type of
   RAM should be the same (i.e. EDO and non-EDO).

If you still experience the same error message after re-adding the RAM, you may
have defective hardware, and should consult your hardware vendor.
