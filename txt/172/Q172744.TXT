MORE INFORMATION
================

The Outline Numbered tab contains eight previews. One of the preview windows
contains no preview (denoted by the word "None"). Selecting this preview will
remove any numbering scheme applied to the current selection. The other previews
allow you to set different customized numbering schemes.

When your insertion point is in a numbered paragraph and you click the Outline
Numbered tab in the Bullets And Numbering dialog box (click Bullets And
Numbering on the Format menu), your custom number scheme should be selected but
it may not appear in the same preview box as it did on the original computer.

When your insertion point is not in a numbered paragraph and you click the
Outline Numbered tab in the Bullets And Numbering dialog box (click Bullets And
Numbering on the Format menu), the selected number scheme appears in the
top-left preview box instead of None and your customized numbering scheme may
not appear.

For additional information about moving a customized numbering scheme to another
computer, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q172631 WD97: Custom Numbering Scheme Not Available on Other Computer

The only settings saved in the document from the customized Outline Numbered
dialog box are the options that are available when you click Customize on the
Outline Numbered dialog box. Any directly applied formatting may be lost or
overridden with formats defined in the default List Number styles. This can
include customized tab settings applied to the original document after the
custom Outline Numbered list was applied.

For additional information the List number style, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

SYMPTOMS
========

computer other than the one used when you created the file, the outline number
scheme may appear in a different preview window on the Outline Numbered tab.

NOTE: To locate the Outline Numbered tab, click Bullets And Numbering from the
Format menu.

CAUSE
=====

The custom outline number format is saved as a part of the document. Hence, when
you open the document on another computer, the custom outline number scheme will
be available.
