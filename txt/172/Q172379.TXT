KEYWORDS:kbprint kbdta winword word97

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a master document from master document view, Microsoft Word will
not print as expected, for example:

 - Word will not print objects set as Float over text that have been inserted
   into subdocuments.

   -or-

 - Word may not print the entire document.

CAUSE
=====

Master document view is not designed to print your entire document. It is
designed for you to control the amount of detail you want to print.

WORKAROUND
==========

Switch to either normal or page layout view, and then print the document.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Master document view helps you organize and maintain a long document, such as a
book or a multi-part report, that is divided into several smaller documents
called "subdocuments." In master document view, you can work in a single
document window and still see the overall organization of the subdocuments. This
view is not designed to print your entire document. Master document view is
designed for you to control the amount of detail you want to print. For example,
when you want to print just an outline, collapse the information to show only
what you want to print, and then when you print from master document view, it
will only print what is shown on the screen.

NOTE: Word will not print objects that have the Float over text option applied.
