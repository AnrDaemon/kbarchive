TITLE   :SMS: Unable to Find Logon Server and No Default Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Smsls.bat file is designed for use with the Automatically Detect All Logon
Servers option, and makes the assumption that the validating domain controller
is also a Systems Management Server logon server.

If logon servers have been manually configured, and a domain controller that is
not also a logon server validates the logon attempt, the client may receive the
following error when running the Smsls.bat file:

   ENU - Error: unable to find logon server and no default server; error 0.


The client will not be inventoried or upgraded, and therefore will not be updated
in the database.


MORE INFORMATION
================

If it is necessary in your environment not to use all domain controllers as
logon servers, then you should use Runsms.bat for your logon script.

Refer to Appendix D "Automatically Adding Clients" of the Systems Management
Server 1.2 "Getting Started Guide," and Chapter 3 of the "Installation and
Configuration" manual, which are available in the online Help.

You can map clients to specific servers by using the Smsls.ini file. For
information on the Smsls.ini file, see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
