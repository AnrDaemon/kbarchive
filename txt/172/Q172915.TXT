TITLE   :Host Security Fails to Enumerate Memberships of Local Groups
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If a cached host user ID and password are configured for a user within a host
security domain, SNA Server fails to map the cached user ID and password,
causing the user's host logon to fail.

This problem occurs when the Windows NT user is a member of a global group that
has been granted membership in a local group associated with the host security
domain. If the user is explicitly added to the local group, the account mapping
is performed correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The host security components determine if a user is a member of a local group
associated with a host security domain. If the local group contains global
groups, those global groups are not correctly enumerated by SNA Server host
security, causing no password cache lookup to occur.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
