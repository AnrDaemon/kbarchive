TITLE   :PRB: Intl Number Settings Cause Upsizing Wizard Failure
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbvfp kbMDAC250

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0a 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

International settings in SET POINT TO and SET SEPARATOR TO cause the following
error to occur in the SQL Server Upsizing Wizard:

   To upsize to SQL Server 6.x, please install a SQL Server ODBC driver version
   2.05 or later

This error does not occur with the Upsizing wizard that shipped with Visual
FoxPro 5.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

Before running the SQL Server Upsizing Wizard, change the number settings using
the following commands:

      SET POINT TO "."
      SET SEPARATOR TO ","

-Or-

If the Regional Settings of Microsoft Visual FoxPro are set to "Use System
Settings," change the settings in the Number tab of the Microsoft Windows 95 or
Windows NT Regional Settings Control Panel to match (without the quotes) the
following:

      Decimal symbol: "."
      Digit grouping symbol: ","

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following program from a program file or the Command window:

         OPEN DATABASE HOME() + "SAMPLES\DATA\TESTDATA"
         SET POINT TO ","
         SET SEPARATOR TO "."
         DO HOME() + "Wizards\WZUpsize.app"

   The Upsizing Wizard for SQL Server appears.

2. Click the database to upsize, then click Next.

3. Click the appropriate data source and click Next. The SQL Server Login \
   dialog box appears.

4. Enter the appropriate User ID and Password then click OK. The following error
   appears:

   To upsize to SQL Server 6.x, please install a SQL Server ODBC driver version
   2.05 or later

This also happens if the Regional Settings in the Control Panel have the same
settings for Point and Separator as listed above in Step 1.

If using the system Regional Settings, as in the second part of the Resolution
Section above, the [Tools][Options][Regional] settings of Microsoft Visual
FoxPro should have the "Use System Settings" option checked.
