 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Word 6.x or 7.x, if you use the Word 97 import converter to open a mail merge
main document created in Word 97, the data document is no longer attached to the
main document.

NOTE: The text, formatting, and field codes of the main document remain intact,
but the main document is no longer a mail merge main document and the data file
is no longer attached. No error messages are displayed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.

Method 1: Reattach the Data File in Word 6.x or 7.x
---------------------------------------------------

If you have the Word 97 import converter, follow these steps:

1. Open the main document in Word 6.x or 7.x using the Word 97 import converter.

2. On the Tools menu, click Mail Merge.

3. Under Main Document, click Create, and then click Form Letters.

4. Click Active Window.

5. Under Data Source, click Get Data, and then click Open Data Source.

6. Navigate to and select the Word 97 data document.

7. Click Open.

8. In the Mail Merge Helper dialog box click Close.

Method 2: Save the Documents in Word 6.0/95 Format
--------------------------------------------------

If you do not have the Word 97 import converter, save both the mail merge main
document and the data document in Word 6.0/95 format. To do this, follow these
steps:

1. Open the mail merge main document in Word 97.

2. On the File menu click Save As.

3. In the Save As Type list, click Word 6.0/95, and type a new file name.

4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 for the data document.

5. In Word 6.x or 7.x, open the main mail merge document you saved in step 3.
