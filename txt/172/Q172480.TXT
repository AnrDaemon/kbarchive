KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When two threads are using the same TP_ID, the GET_LU_STATUS verb hangs on the
second call.

CAUSE
=====

When a GET_LU_STATUS call is made the second time on two threads using the same
TP_ID, the second call should return an AP_TP_BUSY.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,

to the same TP_ID.
