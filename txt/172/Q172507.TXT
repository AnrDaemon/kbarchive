KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Cluster Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to bring a resource online within Microsoft Cluster Server, the
resource may alternate between an online and offline state.

CAUSE
=====

The resource may change states repeatedly if the properties for the resource are
invalid. Invalid resource properties may cause resource failure. Microsoft
Cluster Server will attempt to resolve the situation according to failover
parameters for the resource. By default, the cluster will attempt to restart the
failed resource.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, verify the properties of the resource and change
incorrect settings as necessary.
