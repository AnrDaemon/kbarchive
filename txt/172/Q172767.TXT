TITLE   :Migration Tool for NetWare Cannot Find Domain Controller
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsgkbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Migration Tool for NetWare (Nwconv.exe) on a computer running
Windows NT, you may receive the following error message:

   Cannot connect to server: <servername>
   The Network name cannot be found

where <servername> is the name of the domain controller you are migrating
to. This can occur even if the server you are migrating to is the one from which
you are running the Migration Tool for NetWare.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the ADMIN$ share on the domain controller you are
attempting to migrate to is inaccessible or has been removed. This situation can
occur in Windows NT 4.0 if you run the System Policy editor, open the registry,
and then save it (without making changes).

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify that the administrative shares are being created at startup or restart
the computer for the changes to take affect.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and select the following subkey:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\ 
      LanmanServer\Parameters

2. Verify that AutoShareServer is set to 1, or delete the AutoShareServer value.
