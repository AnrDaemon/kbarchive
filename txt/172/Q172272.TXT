Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of

The purpose of this TreeView sample is to demonstrate the basics of using and
manipulating the TreeView control. This example shows how to add Nodes using the
five different relationship settings of the Nodes Collection Add Method. It will
also allow you to remove a selected Node or branch.

The main focus of the example is to show how to save and restore the Nodes into
an Access Database. The algorithm that you use saves the Nodes in viewing order.
This allows you to save and restore the TreeView control with the Nodes in the
same order as they appeared to the user when the user closed the application.

The sample also shows how to drag and drop Nodes. You can also drag and drop a
Node on top of a different Node so that the dragged Node is now the child of the
Node it was dropped on.

For more information on the TreeView control please see Help or page 453 of the
Professional Features Custom Control Reference.

To use this sample, open Treeview.vbp in the VB IDE and press the F5 key or
choose Start from the Run menu.
