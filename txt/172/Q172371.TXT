SUMMARY
=======

When using Network Monitor and a token ring network interface card (NIC) to
capture network frames, the following message may appear:

   Tokenring Error!
   Internal tokenring software error.

When the dialog box containing this message appears, Network Monitor continues
capturing. Clicking OK closes the message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is a hardware error passed to Network Monitor by the token ring NIC. The
NIC receives an error, and the driver interprets it. There is no way to tell if
it is encountering a network-related error, other than looking at the network
trace (sniff) at the time of the error.
