PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Windows 95 clients attempt to log on to a Windows NT domain, they receive
the following message:

   You are not allowed to log on at this time.

CAUSE
=====

This is a message received from the Windows NT version 3.51 or 4.0 domain
controller. It is generated when time restrictions have been imposed on a user
account, and the user is trying to log on outside his allowed time.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, remove or change the time restrictions on this user by
performing the following steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and
   click User Manager.

2. Select the user from the Username view pane.

3. From the User menu, click Properties.

4. Click Hours.

5. Change the logon hours to times that are appropriate. Cleared check boxes
   indicate users cannot log on during those times. Check boxes that are shaded
   indicate users can log on during those times.

Verify that the validating server's time settings are as correct. This can be
confirmed in the Control Panel Date/Time tool.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT 3.51 and 4.0 clients receive a more informative message:

   Your account has time restrictions that prevent you from logging on at this
   time. Please try again later.
