TITLE   :PRB: "Data Type Conversion Error" When Using a Data Control
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Deleting the data from a text box bound to certain data types, such as an
integer or date, causes Error 3421:

   "Data Type Conversion Error."

NOTE: If you are using a dbGrid, it's Error Method will produce Error 16389.

CAUSE
=====

This is designed behavior of DAO. The data control is sending a NULL string to
DAO and DAO attempts to coerce it to a number and fails. This is not a problem
with the Data Control: The same behavior can be observed without the use of a
Data Control, using only code. For example:

      Set db = OpenDatabase("nwind.mdb", False, False)
      Set rs = db.OpenRecordset("select shipvia from orders", dbOpenDynaset)
      rs.Edit
      rs(0) = ""

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the following code in the Data Controls Validate method to allow the edit to
occur as expected by user:

      Private Sub Data1_Validate(Action As Integer, Save As Integer)
         If Text1.DataChanged Then
            Text1.DataChanged = False 'So this data is not saved
            Data1.UpdateRecord  ' This saves the data that
                                ' may have changed in the other controls

            ' Now clear the numeric field
            Data1.Recordset.Edit
            Data1.Recordset![Year Born] = Null
            Data1.Recordset.Update
        End If
      End Sub

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Place a data control and a textbox on a form.

2. Bind the textbox to an integer column of a table.

3. Delete the data from the text box.

4. Move off the record. Note that you get the "data type conversion error in the
   error event of the data control. This happens with Jet 3.5, 3.0, or 2.5, but
   does not happen in 16-bit Visual Basic.
