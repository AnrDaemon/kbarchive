SUMMARY
=======

The Visual Basic 5.0 Books Online topic entitled "Adding internet features to
controls" contains an error in the PictureFromURL Property Let procedure.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you run the sample code, you may receive the compile error "Variable not
defined" or run-time error 424 "Object Required".

The compile error results from the following line of code in the PictureFromURL
Property Let procedure:

      If (AmbientProperties.UserMode = True) _
            And (NewString <> "") Then

This line of code should read as follows:

      If (UserControl.Ambient.UserMode = True) _
            And (NewString <> "") Then

The Ambient property of a UserControl returns an AmbientProperties object that
holds the ambient properties of its container.

======

This documentation error has been fixed in Visual Basic 6.0.
