TITLE   :PRB: Autolist Feature Breaks When Project Cannot Compile
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbide kbVBp kbVBp500 kbVBp600 kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Visual Basic Development Environment, the Autolist feature does not work
for Class or Standard Module objects.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur when two Enum structures have the same name within a
project. The project cannot be compiled under these circumstances; you receive
the following error when the project compiles:

   Compile Error: Ambiguous Name Detected: <name>


RESOLUTION
==========

Resolve the ambiguous name by renaming one of the Enum structures. If you are
unsure if this is the cause of the problem, select Start With Full Compile from
the Run menu. If you receive an "Ambiguous Name Detected" error, check your code
for the name listed in the error message.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new "Standard EXE" project in Visual Basic.

2. Add a form, two class modules, and a standard module.

3. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Module1:

      Public Sub modulesub()

      End Sub

4. Add the following code to Class1:

      Public Enum test
         a = 1
         b = 2
         c = 3
      End Enum

      Public Sub classonesub()

      End Sub

5. Add the following code to Class2:

      Public Enum test
         a = 1
         b = 2
         c = 3
      End Enum

      Public Sub classtwosub()

      End Sub

6. In the Click event of Form1, add the following code:

      Dim c1 As New Class1
      Dim c2 As New Class2
      ' test code here

7. In the Click event of Form1, try adding code that normally causes the
   Autolist feature to display. You must type the following entries; do not cut
   and paste. For example:

      c1.
      c2.
      Module1.

   Note that after you type the period, the Autolist feature is not invoked as
   expected.
