SUMMARY
=======

You can use three different logging file methods with Internet Information
Server (IIS). These methods are Daily, Weekly, and Monthly. You can select these
methods by selecting the appropriate service computer name in Internet Service
Manager. Then select Properties, Service Properties, then the Logging tab.

The Daily log files are created at 12:00 A.M. of each day. They use the following
date format for filenames: INyymmdd.log.

The Weekly log files are created at 12:00 A.M. on Sunday of each week. They use
the following date format for filenames: INyymmww.log.

The Monthly log files are created at 12:00 A.M. on the first day of each month.
They use the following date format for filenames: INyymm.log.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you switch from Daily to Weekly logging formats, a new Weekly log file is
created at the time the change is applied, then again at 12:00 A.M. on Sunday of
each week.

For example, on Friday afternoon the change is made from Daily to Weekly format.
A new Weekly log file is created at this time, then again at 12:00 A.M. the
following Sunday.

When you switch from Daily or Weekly to Monthly logging formats, a new Monthly
log file is created at the time the change is applied, then again at 12:00 A.M.
on the first day of the next month.

For example, on Friday afternoon the change is made from Daily to Monthly format.
A new Weekly log file is created at this time, then again at 12:00 A.M. the
first day of the following month.
