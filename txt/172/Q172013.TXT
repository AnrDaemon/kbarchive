TITLE   :W/out ODBC/DRDA Option, 32-Bit ODBC Administrator Is Deleted
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1; winnt:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
 - Microsoft SNA Workstation, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you do not select the ODBC/DRDA option when setting up SNA Server or SNA
Client, or if you remove SNA Server or SNA Client from your system, the 32- Bit
ODBC Administrator is deleted from %Winroot%\System32. This is a shared program
and should not be deleted by SNA Server.

CAUSE
=====

The file Odbcad32.exe is not installed as a system file. This causes it to be
deleted by SNA Server Setup or SNA Client Setup if ODBC/DRDA is not selected, or
if the product is removed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
