KEYWORDS:kbsetup

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The AS/400 Wizard and the 3270 Wizard allow invalid SAP entries when configuring
DLC connections. No error message appears when the invalid SAP address is
entered, but the Wizards fail when they attempt to set the invalid address.

CAUSE
=====

The AS/400 and 3270 Wizard routines do not check to validate that the SAP is an
appropriate hexadecimal value.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, the edit boxes where the SAP is entered are changed to
drop-down boxes containing only valid SAP entries.
