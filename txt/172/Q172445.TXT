TITLE   :Directory Replication Is Erratic With Ntconfig.pol, Config.pol
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an export server exports a Ntconfig.pol file to its own import directory, and
if the file is changed (by adding or removing a privilege), the file is not
replicated. No errors appear in the event log, and the status reads OK, but the
date/time stamp on the export directory file is changed, although the previous
time remains on the import directory file.

A small text file placed in the export folder will replicate along with the
Ntconfig.pol file. If that text file is edited, replication will occur for the
whole directory. If you modify the Ntconfig.pol file only, it will not
replicate. No errors appear, and replication status reads OK.

RESOLUTION
==========

Rename the Ntconfig.pol, keeping the .pol extension. Allow replication to occur,
and then rename the file, giving it the original file name (Ntconfig.pol or
Config.pol). Replication should occur normally. After this, you can change the
file as needed; replication continues unless a file is open.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and posts new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
