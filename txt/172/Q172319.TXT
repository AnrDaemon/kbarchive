======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.6a 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, Professional Edition, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The SYS(2033,n) returns the path information for either the System folder,
Extensions folder, Preferences folder, or the Microsoft folder. The value of "n"
determines the folder and the path being returned.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Often, the exact path to a particular folder on the machine needs to be known.
For example, FoxPro 2.6a for the Macintosh places the FoxTools.mlb file in the
Extensions folder. Since both hard drive names and folder names can vary between
machines, there is no way to hard code a path that would work on all machines.
The SYS(2033,n) function is useful in determining this information.

According to the Help File, the SYS(2033,n) function has four values for the
numeric expression n. These values and the folders they return are:

   0 System Folder
   1 Extensions Folder
   2 Preferences Folder
   3 Microsoft Folder

For example, in FoxPro 2.6a for the Macintosh, the SYS(2033,1) function can be
used in conjunction with the SET LIBRARY TO command to point to the FoxTools.mlb
file in the Preferences folder.

      SET LIBRARY TO SYS(2033,2)+":FoxTools.mlb"
      ? SET("LIBRARY")  &&& Returns FoxTools.mlb
