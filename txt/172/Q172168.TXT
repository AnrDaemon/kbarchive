When a policy file has User\Shell\Restrictions\Hide all items on desktop
selected (enabled), programs specified by Computer\System\Run\Run do not run the
first time a user logs in if a local profile does not exist. However, the
programs will run at subsequent log on attempts or after a local profile has
been created.

researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
