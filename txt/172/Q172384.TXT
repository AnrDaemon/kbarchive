DOCUMENT:Q172384  10-AUG-2001  [winnt]
TITLE   :WINS Database Displays Hyphens Instead of NetBIOS Suffix
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) database using WINS
Manager, you may notice the sixteenth character representation of each NetBIOS
name is a hyphen such as the following:

   <computer name> - 102.54.94.97

What you expect to see is a hexidecimal value such as the following:

   <computer name>[00h] 102.54.94.97

CAUSE
=====

WINS Manager is configured to display the database using LANManager Compatible
conventions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, enable the LANManager Compatible feature using the
following steps:

1. In WINS Manager, click Options, and then click Preferences.

2. Click LAN Manager-Compatible, to enable the option.

3. Click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

From the context-sensitive help in WINS Manager for Computer Names:

   Specifies whether computer names will adhere to the Lan Manager naming
   convention, where computer names are limited to 15 characters, as opposed to
   16-character NETBIOS names used by other sources. In LAN Manager names, the
   16th byte is used to indicate whether the device is a workstation, messenger,
   and so on.

   Select the LAN Manager Compatible check box if you want to use this
   convention. Note that WIndows NT follows the LAN Manager convention, so this
   check box should be selected unless your network accepts NetBIOS names from
   other sources.
