TITLE   :PRB: DISPLAY STATUS Shows Only 210 Characters of SET PATH TO
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, Professional Edition, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

DISPLAY STATUS shows only 210 characters of the current setting of the SET PATH
TO statement even though the character limit for SET PATH TO is 255 characters.

RESOLUTION
==========

Since this problem is fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0, the best way to avoid it is by
upgrading to Visual FoxPro 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample code when run in Visual FoxPro for Windows version 3.0x
illustrates the problem:

      ** *** Sample Program - TESTPATH.PRG
      ** *** Illustrates DISPLAY STATUS string length limit of SET PATH

         CLEAR

   s1="c:\vfp30b;c:\vfp30b\api;c:\vfp30b\api\samples;c:\vfp30b\distrib.src;c:\ 
   vfp30b\distrib.src\setup;c:\vfp30b\distrib.src\setup\setup16"

   ** *** S2 length = 210 represents maximum length shown as result of
   DISPLAY STATUS

   s2="c:\vfp30b;c:\vfp30b\api;c:\vfp30b\api\samples;c:\vfp30b\distrib.src;c:\ 
   vfp30b\distrib.src\setup;c:\vfp30b\distrib.src\setup\setup16;c:\vfp30b\dist
   rib.src\setup\setup32;c:\vfp30b\distrib.src\system;c:\vfp30b\dis"

   ** *** S3 length = 255 which is maximum string length before giving  ** ***
   'Syntax Error'

   s3="c:\vfp30b;c:\vfp30b\api;c:\vfp30b\api\samples;c:\vfp30b\distrib.src;c:\ 
   vfp30b\distrib.src\setup;c:\vfp30b\distrib.src\setup\setup16;c:\vfp30b\dist
   rib.src\setup\setup32;c:\vfp30b\distrib.src\system;c:\vfp30b\distrib.src\sy
   stem\system16;c:\vfp30b\distrib.sr"

   ** *** cannot set S4 since it gives syntax error.
   ** ***
   s4="c:\vfp30b;c:\vfp30b\api;c:\vfp30b\api\samples;c:\vfp30b\distrib.src;c:\ 
   vfp30b\distrib.src\setup;c:\vfp30b\distrib.src\setup\setup16;c:\vfp30b\dist
   rib.src\setup\setup32;c:\vfp30b\distrib.src\system;c:\vfp30b\distrib.src\sy
   stem\system16;c:\vfp30b\distrib.src"

      ?LEN(s1)
      SET PATH TO &s1
      ?"RETURN VALUE OF ?SET('PATH') is:"
      ?SET("path")
      DISP STAT

      CLEAR
      ?" S2 length = "
      ??LEN(s2)
      ??"  which is the maximum display length of DISPLAY STATUS"
      SET PATH TO &s2
      ?"RETURN VALUE OF ?SET('PATH') is:"
      ?SET("path")
      DISP STAT

      CLEAR
      ?" S3 length = "
      ??LEN(s3)
      ??"  which is the maximum length before giving 'Syntax Error'"
      SET PATH TO &s3
      ?"RETURN VALUE OF ?SET('PATH') is:"
      ?SET("path")
      DISP STAT

      CLEAR
      ?" S4 cannot be set since it is one greater than s3 (which is "
      ?? ALLTRIM(STR(LEN(s3)))
      ??") and would give 'Syntax Error'"
