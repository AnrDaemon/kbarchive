TITLE   :MAILSRV: Unable to Receive Mail from UNIX
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the MAILSRV utility that ships with the Windows NT Resource Kit,
you may be unable to receive e-mail messages from UNIX hosts, but e-mail
messages from other clients, such as Exchange, are delivered as expected.

When the UNIX client sends an e-mail message to the Windows NT local user running
MAILSRV, the message is delivered to the mail spool directory but the message
never reaches the Inbox.

The following message may appear in Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 3004
   Description: "The message could not be delivered to local user <user>.
   The error from the operating system was <n>" where <n> is either
   "2" or "5".

The remote UNIX computer sending the e-mail may receive one of the following
error messages:

   "Unable to send termination"

-or-

   "Undeliverable"


MORE INFORMATION
================

Users can send e-mail to remote UNIX sites successfully from this MAILSRV
utility; only receiving e-mail is impacted.

The following files are found in the spool directory and remain there when this
symptom occurs:

   local.queuecontrol

   smtp.queuecontrol

   dead.queuecontrol

   mqxx.xxxx

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the MAILSRV utility shipped in
the Windows NT Resource Kit version 4.0. The MAILSRV utility has been pulled
from the latest release of the Resource Kit. This problem will not be fixed due
to other problems encountered while attempting to resolve this problem.
