TITLE   :FIX: Out of Order Definitions in idl May Cause Compiler Errors
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINNT:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCompiler kbCPPonly kbVC500bug kbVS97sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the #import directive, errors may be generated due to the order in
which definitions appear in the idl file used to generate the type library. The
sample below causes error C2504, base class undefined, due to the interfaces
being defined globally instead of in the library block.

RESOLUTION
==========

Move the interface definitions into the library block.

   - or -

Create an extraneous reference to the class that the compiler is generating an
error from within the library block.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service
Pack 3.

         // move the definitions of A and B into the
         // library block for one workaround
