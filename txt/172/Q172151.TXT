TITLE   :SAM Failed to Start the TCP/IP or SPX/IPX Listening Thread
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you remove File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) an error is posted
in the Windows NT 4.0 Event Log:

   Event ID 12291: SAM failed to start the TCP/IP or SPX/IPX listening thread.

The error is benign and causes no loss in functionality.

NOTE: FPNW may have been removed when running Windows NT 3.51 as required by the
upgrade to Windows NT 4.0, this will also cause error 12291.

CAUSE
=====

This may be due to a failure by the FPNW uninstall process to remove two
registry values under the LSA Control key.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the following two values exist in the registry, remove them to prevent
further occurrences of this error.

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA\ 
   NetwareClientSupport

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA\ 
   Notification

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.


1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and select the following subkey:

2. Select the value NetwareClientSupport click Delete from the Edit menu.

3. Select the Notification value and click Delete from the Edit menu.

MORE INFORMATION
================

able to resolve this error by applying or reapplying the current service pack
for Windows NT 4.0, and/or reapplying any vendor specific updates.
