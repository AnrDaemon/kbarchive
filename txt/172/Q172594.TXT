======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 or 2.1 (OSR2) and you
attempt to connect to an SMB server with a 15-character name that contains a
period as one of the characters, you may receive the following error message:

   The network name cannot be found.

If the server name contains only 14 characters with a period, or 15 characters
with no period, the operation proceeds normally.

CAUSE
=====

There is a problem with the Microsoft Client for Microsoft Networks (VRedir)
that is included with OSR2. The problem occurs when the client parses server
names that contain a period; server names that contain a period are treated as
too long if they exceed 14 characters in length.


RESOLUTION
==========


To work around this problem, rename the server so that the name does not contain
a period, or is shorter than 15 characters.

STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.
