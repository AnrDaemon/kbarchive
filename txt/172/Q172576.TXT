TITLE   :Changing PW on FPNW Prompts for Fully Qualified NDS User Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your password has expired and you try to change it when logging on to your
computer, you could be prompted for a NetWare Directory Service (NDS)
fully-qualified user name. You will not be prompted for this name if you are
already logged on and it is not obvious what this name should be.

CAUSE
=====

When you change the password on a Windows NT computer using NDS, Windows NT will
search for the NDS information in the registry using the security ID (SID). If
you have not completed the logon process, the SID is not known and this
information has to be obtained from the user.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you are prompted for this information you can click Cancel and then proceed
to change the password once you've logged on to the computer. You can then use
the SID of the current user to query the registry.
