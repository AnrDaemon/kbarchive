SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to install the Perl 5 Scripting Language from the
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kits.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Press recommends using the Resource Kit Setup program to install Perl
to your system.

Installation Instructions Using the Resource Kit Setup
------------------------------------------------------

To install Perl using the Resource Kit Setup program, follow these steps:

1. Insert the Resource Kit Tools and Utilities disc into your CD-ROM drive.

2. At the Resource Kit screen, click Install Resource Kit, and then click Accept
   to accept the Resource Kit license agreement.

3. Select a Custom installation.

4. In the Custom/Complete installation dialog box click to select File/Batch
   Tools, and then click Change Option.

5. Click the Perl Scripting Language check box to select it, and then click OK.

6. Click Continue. Follow the directions on the screen to continue through the
   Setup process.

Manual Installation
-------------------

If you choose to install Perl manually, rather than by using the Resource Kit
Setup, follow these steps:

1. Copy the directory tree located at, \Source\Gnu\Perl to your hard drive.

2. From the Perl folder on your hard drive, run Install.bat to install Perl to
   your system.

NOTE: You cannot install Perl by running Install.bat from the CD-ROM. The
installation batch file will attempt to write several files to the installation
directory. Since you cannot write files to a normal CD-ROM, the batch file will
fail.


Further information on the Perl 5 Scripting Language can be found in the
Readme.doc file located in the root directory of the CD-ROM.
