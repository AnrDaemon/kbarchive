TITLE   :Last Byte of Transparent Section Interpreted Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The last byte in a transparent section gets interpreted as being outside the
transparent section when the transparent section is immediately preceded by a
control character (IE - "0D"). For instance, the following sequence has '0D'
(carriage return) followed by a transparent section starting with '35'. In this
case, the 1B (Esc character) would be inappropriately dropped and, therefore,
the remaining bytes would be sent to the printer without the leading Esc
character. This would cause the remaining bytes to be printed when they were
actually intended to be part of the escape sequence.

CAUSE
=====

When there is a control character immediately preceding transparent sections,
there was a bug in the code which caused the print server to believe the
transparent section to be one byte shorter than it really was.

RESOLUTION
==========

A change was made to check whether a transparent byte has actually been sent to
the printer before decrementing the number of transparent bytes left to be
processed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server, version
3.0 SP1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
