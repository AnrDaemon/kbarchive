======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c, 2.6a 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, Professional Edition, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The FxGDepth() function in FoxTools returns the number of colors currently in
use on a monitor from within FoxPro 2.6a for Macintosh or Visual FoxPro 3.0b for
the Macintosh.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The code example below returns the version of FoxPro currently executing, load
the appropriate version of FoxTools and ascertains the number of colors
currently in use on the screen. Since FoxPro 2.6a places the FoxTools.mlb file
in the System/Extension folder, the path needs to be customized for each
individual machine to correctly identify the proper hard drive name and
folders:

      ****Begin Code Example****
      IF ATC("Visual",Version())>0
         SET LIBRARY TO HOME()+"FoxTools.cfm"
      Else
         SET LIBRARY TO SYS(2033,1)+":FoxTools.mlb"
      ENDIF
      nvideocolors=FxGDepth()
      IF nvideocolors >0
         WAIT WINDOW "Your Monitor is running "+ALLTRIM(STR(nvideocolors)) ;
         + "colors"
      ELSE
         WAIT WINDOW "Your monitor is running millions of colors"
      ENDIF
      ****End Code Example****

The FxGDepth() function returns an integer indicating the number of colors
currently running on the monitor. However, setting the monitor to millions of
colors causes the FxGDepth() function to return 0. To change the number of
colors the monitor uses, in the Apple menu, choose Control Panels and then
Monitors.

This information can be used to warn users of potential memory problems. If the
machine uses millions of colors and it also has limited RAM, FoxPro 2.x or
Visual FoxPro may have difficulty running successfully. To determine the amount
of RAM on a Macintosh machine from within Visual FoxPro, use the FxGestalt()
function.

Please note that the FxGestalt() function is available only with FoxTools.cfm
shipped with Visual FoxPro for the Macintosh 3.0b.
