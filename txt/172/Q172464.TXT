TITLE   :SMS: PowerPoint Loses Cursor When PCMWIN16 Is Loaded
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbPCM smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2

SYMPTOMS
========

If Package Command Manager (Pcmwin16.exe) is running and a new or existing
PowerPoint presentation is being edited, the mouse cursor may disappear from the
PowerPoint window but still show when moved to the taskbar, desktop, or another
window. Although the mouse is invisible, it may still work (and reappear when
you select something in the PowerPoint window). However, in most cases, you must
shut down PowerPoint to get the mouse to reappear.


CAUSE
=====

The Package Command Manager Polling interval interferes with the ShowCursor
routines within PowerPoint.

STATUS
======
