SYMPTOMS

When you use the Ping.exe tool included with Windows 95, you may receive any of
the following error messages:

   The Icmp.dll file cannot start. Check the file to determine the problem.

   Unable to initialize Windows Sockets interface, error code 6.

Note that the first error message may be misleading because the Icmp.dll file may
