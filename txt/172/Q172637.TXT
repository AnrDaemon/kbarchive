TITLE   :User Able to Open Display Session If Associated Printer in Use
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Associated Printers function in SNA Manager to assign a
particular Printer Session to a particular Display LU and a user disconnects the
display session while keeping the Associated Printer session active, a new user
can connect to this display session. The new user is unable to get a printer
session because it is already in use.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server is not checking to see whether the associated printer LU is in use by
another user.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, SNA Server does not allow a user to obtain a display LU if
it has an associated printer session that already in use by another user.

NOTE: The user who has the printer session open will still be able to reopen the
associated 3270 display session. This problem only affects the case where
another user was being allowed to open a display session when its associated
printer is already open.
