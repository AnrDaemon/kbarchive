The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log off or shut down Windows NT, the system may stop responding or
delay for a long period of time if an application is in the process of opening a
large file. Windows NT may deliver a pop-up message asking you to wait for the
application to finish or to close the nonresponding application. Choosing End
Task may not allow the computer to close the process and proceed with the logoff
or shutdown process as expected. The file may have to load completely before
Windows NT will log off or shut down properly.

This symptom may affect users running remote shutdowns and UPSs.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: log-off shut-down
