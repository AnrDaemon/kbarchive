PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe500 kbSSafe600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Visual SourceSafe setup you may receive the following error
message:

   You must have NT administrative privileges in order to run setup

CAUSE
=====

There are two possible reasons this message may appear:

CASE #1: You are running setup on a Windows 95 computer.

There is a registry entry indicating that this is a Windows NT computer.

CASE #2: You are running Netsetup on a Windows NT client computer.

Visual SourceSafe expects, by design, that anyone installing Visual SourceSafe on
a Windows NT computer has administrative privileges.

WORKAROUND
==========

CASE #1:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

Run Regedit and delete the subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ProductOptions

CASE #2:

Edit the <VSS server dir>\netsetup\Setup32.stf file using the following
step-by-step instructions:

WARNING: Please make a backup of the Setup32.stf file before continuing.

1. Shut down all instances of Netsetup.

2. Open the <VSS server dir>\netsetup\Setup32.stf in Notepad. On the Edit
   menu, make sure that the Word Wrap check box is not selected.

3. Note that the 17th line starts with "ObjId", and that the lines underneath
   line 17 are numbered sequentially.

4. On the lines numbered 9, 10, and 11, delete the number 26. (These lines
   should correspond to Floppy Mode, Batch Mode, and Maintenance Mode underneath
   the "STANDARD" heading.

5. Save and Close the file.

6. Run Netsetup from the Windows NT client.
