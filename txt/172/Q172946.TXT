SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to install the Simple Mail Handler service for
Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Outlook. This service is included in the
BackOffice Resource Kit (BORK). The Simple Mail Handler (SMH) tool is similar to
the Microsoft Exchange Client Inbox Assistant, but does not require a connection
to a Microsoft Exchange Server computer. The SMH tool also has more advanced
filtering capabilities than those available in the Inbox Assistant.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The instructions in the Help file included with the BORK, Version 1, and BORK,
Part 2 indicate that you should run Mergeini.exe to install the MAPI service.
However, when you run this program, you receive the following error message:

   File does not exist.

The purpose of the Mergeini.exe file is to add the settings from the Smh.inf file
to the Mapisvc.inf file. The Smh.inf file is included in the BackOffice Resource
Kit: Part One, but not in Part Two.

To successfully install the Simple Mail Handler service for all operating systems
except Windows NT Workstation:

   From the Exchange\<operating system>\<platform>\Client\SMH folder
   on the Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit, Second Edition compact disc, copy
   Mergeini.exe, Smh.inf, and the Smh.dll file for your operating system to the
   Windows\System folder on your computer.

For Windows NT Workstation:

   Copy Mergeini.exe, Smh.inf, and Smh.dll to the System32 folder on your
   computer.

To add Simple Mail Handler to the list of available Microsoft Exchange Server
services:

1. Run Mergeini.exe using the following command-line syntax:

   Mergeini.exe -m<install path>smh.inf

2. In Control Panel, double-click the Mail and Fax icon.

3. Click the Services tab, and then click Add.

4. Click Simple Mail Handler, and then click OK.

NOTE: These instructions are included in the BORK, Part 3, Help file.
