SYMPTOMS

When you add eight or more servers to the Performance Data Log Service utility
provided in the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit, one of the following symptoms may
occur when attempting to stop the service:

   Error: "The instruction at "0x77f64c5f" referenced memory at "0x013ab60d".
   The memory could not be "read". Click on OK to terminate the application."

-or-

   Error: "The instruction at "0x77f64c5f" referenced memory at "0x013ab60d".
   The memory could not be "written" Click on OK to terminate the application."

-or-

   The service is not stopped.

The symptom occurs usually shortly after adding or removing computers or when
starting or stopping monitoring.

STATUS

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Pdlsvc.exe utility in the
Windows NT Resource Kit. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
