TITLE   :BID Response Not Honoring Pacing Indicator from FMI Application
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If an SNA Client system does not receive a Host data stream after successful
session initialization, a problem with pacing may have occurred between the Host
and the SNA Server. Users will not receive data from the Host, even though the
session is still active in SNA Manager.

CAUSE
=====

When a host sends a pacing indicator (Byte 2 of the RH set to 81) in an FMI
message, SNA Server changes it to a value of 80 (no pacing). The Host is then
unable to send the data because it has not received a pacing response.

A modification made to SNA Server version 3.0 had a side effect of disabling
pacing if the first RU received on a session does not have the PI (pacing
indicator) bit set.

For additional information about the RH (request header), please refer to the IBM
SNA Formats Guide (GA27-3136).

RESOLUTION
==========

Snaservr.exe has been modified so that pacing is not disabled.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 3.0 and 3.0 Service
Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
