TITLE   :SNA Workstation Traps When an APPC Application Calls DISPLAY()
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1; winnt:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
 - Microsoft SNA Workstation, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When an APPC application running on SNA Workstation makes a DISPLAY() call with
disp.mode_def_info=AP_YES, SNA Workstation traps and generates a Drwatson32.log
file.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server Service incorrectly parses the configuration file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Workstation versions 3.0 and
3.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, a change to Snaservr.exe is implemented on both SNA Server
and SNA Workstation so that the trap in s1pnsdmd does not occur when the
DISPLAY() call is made. Although you only see this problem with SNA Workstation,
the fix changes Snaserver.exe in both SNA Server and SNA Workstation.
