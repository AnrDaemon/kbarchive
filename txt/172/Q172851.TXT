and line feed characters are inserted into the detail band of the output text
file.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Use a table.

2. Create a new report form called Test.

3. From the Report Designer Menu select Report.

4. Select Quick Report.

5. Select either vertical or horizontal layout.

6. Save the report.

7. From the command line, type:

         REPORT FORM test PREVIEW

8. Observe the placement of the data elements within the detail band.

9. From the command line, type:

         REPORT FORM test TO FILE test ASCII

WORKAROUND

In the Visual FoxPro Command window issue the following command:

Then print the report to the file using the ASCII clause and it does not place
the extra CR+LF into the text file output.

NOTE: The default for _ASCIIROWS = 63.
