The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for Macintosh 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you have installed a Power Macintosh upgrade (accelerator) card into your 68K
Macintosh, the Power Macintosh version of Microsoft Bookshelf may not be
installed. Instead, the 68K version of Bookshelf may be installed.

Not all installation programs may be able to recognize the change in processors,
and may obtain the type of processor information from the older (68K) processor
instead of the newer processor found on the upgrade card. As a result, the
computer is recognized as being a 68K Macintosh instead of a Power Macintosh.

Accelerator manufacturers implement processor upgrades using a variety of
methods. One brand/model of accelerator may function correctly with a given
installation program while another may not.
