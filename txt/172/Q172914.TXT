KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbprogramming

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to run a 32-bit Windows CPIC application using the SNA Windows
95 Client software installed on a Windows NT computer, the CPIC application may
encounter an access violation (0xC0000005) when started.

This problem can occur with any CPIC application when run in this configuration;
it was originally found while testing the SNA Windows 95 AFTP client software
(Aftp.exe) on Windows NT.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server Windows 95 version of the Wcpic32.dll file attempts to load
Dbgtrace.dll. This attempt fails when the SNA Windows 95 client is installed and
running on Windows NT.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================

load Dbgtrace.dll when running on Windows NT.
