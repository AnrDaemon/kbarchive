TITLE   :Event 567, RC =10048 When Restarting SNA Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11,3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the SnaBase or SnaServer services fail with an access violation, the TCP/IP
socket ports that they use may not be cleaned up properly. When you attempt to
restart the SnaBase or SnaServer service, you will see the following error
logged in the event viewer:

   Event ID: 567
   Description: Creation of a named pipe failed, rc = 10048, pipe = <socket
   number>

The 10048 error corresponds to Winsock error WSAEADDRINUSE (address in use).
After this problem occurs, the server must be restarted in order to restart SNA
Server.

CAUSE
=====

If SnaBase or SnaServer encounters an access violation, it leaves some sockets
in the open state.


NOTE: You must still investigate the original cause of the access violation. Open
a case with Microsoft Product Support Services, and provide the following
information:

   <Ntroot>\Drwtsn32.log
   <Snaroot>\Traces\Snadump.log
   Windows NT application logs
   System event logs

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 2.11.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, SNA Server cleans up the sockets in the top-level
exception handler supported by Snadmod.dll. The cleanup will always happen,
provided the exception handler is invoked, and services can be restarted without
restarting the computer in such situations.
