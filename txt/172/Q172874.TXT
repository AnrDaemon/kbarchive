TITLE   :WD97: Web Publisher Does Not Make Absolute Paths Relative Paths
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:winword word97 kbwdinternet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a Web page containing links with absolute paths, the absolute
paths do not become relative paths after you post the page to the Web. (To post
a web page, click Publish to Web, on the File menu, provided you have installed
Web Authoring Tools Update version 1.5 .)

CAUSE
-----

This functionality is by design. Word creates an absolute path whenever you do
any of the following:

 - Create a link with an absolute path in the HTML source.

   -or-

 - Insert a Video or Background Sound from the Insert menu in Word, and clear
   the Use Relative Paths check box.

   -or-

 - Insert a hyperlink in Word and clear the "Use relative path for hyperlink"
   check box.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, use the following methods:

 - Manually edit the link in the HTML source to make it a relative path.

   -or-

 - When you insert a Video or Background Sound via the Insert menu in Word,
   select the Use Relative Path check box.

   -or-

 - When you insert a hyperlink in Word, select the "Use relative path for
   hyperlink" check box.
