TITLE   :BUG: Stopping IIS WWW Service Causes Application Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork kbvfp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Stopping the WWW Publishing service in Internet Information Server (IIS) 3.0
after loading an Active Server Pages (ASP) page that instantiates a Visual
FoxPro automation server causes an application error in Inetinfo.exe.

This error only occurs with in-process automation servers (DLL). Out-of- process
automation servers (EXE) do not cause the error.

The Internet Information Server is only supported currently on Windows NT 4.0,
Service Pack 2 and above.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use an out-of-process automation server (EXE) instead of the in-process
automation server (DLL).

NOTE: In order for the ASP Page to access the Out of Process Server you will need
to set the 'AllowOutOfProcCmpnts' Windows registry entry to a value of '1'.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
