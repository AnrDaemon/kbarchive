TITLE   :FIX: ATL Service Causes Random Asserts in Run Member Function
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.1,2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbATL210bug kbServer kbService kbVC600fix kbATL300fix kbATL100bug kbGrpDSMFCATL

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL), versions 1.1, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Random asserts occur in the ATL services CComModule derived classes Run member
function.

CAUSE
=====

In the first line of the member function an HRESULT variable is declared, hr.
This variable is used throughout the function except in the call to
CoInitialize(). Right after the call to CoInialize() is an assert on the value
of hr. Since hr has not yet been initialized, the assert will fail at the point
where the uninitialized value of hr is negative.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the CoInitailize() call to assign its return value to the hr variable,
not hRes variable. Remove the hRes variable from the following code:

      HRESULT hr;

      _Module.dwThreadID = GetCurrentThreadId();

      HRESULT hRes = CoInitialize(NULL);

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 6.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Create an ATL service. If the hr uninitialized value is negative, the first
assert in the Run function fails.
