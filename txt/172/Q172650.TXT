SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to run certain third-party utilities, such as DumpACL from
Somarsoft, using the AT Scheduler in Windows NT 4.0, you may receive a Visual
C++ runtime error or nothing will happen when the scheduled job runs.

This problem does not exist under Windows NT 3.51.

CAUSE
=====

Some utilities, like DumpAcl, make too many interactive API calls to be used
under the Windows NT 4.0 AT Scheduler service.

RESOLUTION
==========

Run the utility without using the AT Scheduler.

================
