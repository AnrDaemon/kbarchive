TITLE   :Shortcuts Missing from Start Menu After Windows Setup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbtool win95

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows 95, various shortcuts (possibly including Calculator,
Character Map, Disk Defragmenter, DriveSpace, MS-DOS Prompt, Notepad, Phone
Dialer, and Windows Explorer) may be missing from the Start menu. Removing and
reinstalling these components does not create the shortcuts, nor does running
the group converter tool (GRPCONV.EXE /S).

CAUSE
=====

When you ran Setup, the PATH environment variable did not include the Windows
folder, or the PATH environment variable was changed after the initial reboot
during Setup. A likely cause of this issue is a network login script that sets
the PATH variable. To check this, type "set" (without the quotation marks) at a
command prompt. This command lists the current environment variables, including
the PATH setting.

RESOLUTION
==========

Correct the "SET PATH=" statement in the local Autoexec.bat file and/or the
network login script as necessary. Make sure that the "SET PATH=" statement
includes the Windows folder (for example, C:\Windows). Then, run Setup again.
When you are prompted, choose the "Restore Windows files that are changed or
corrupted" option.
