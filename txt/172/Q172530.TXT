TITLE   :Deleted UNC Connection While In Use Causes an In-Page Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A computer running Windows NT Server 3.51 or Windows NT Workstation 3.51 may
allow a universal naming convention (UNC) connection to be disconnected even
though that UNC connection is required for other programs to run.

An application may experience an in-page i/o pop-up error message (0xC0000006) or
the application may just quit because of a stack fault after the application
attempts to handle the in-page errors.


CAUSE
=====

This problem only occurs if the client requests that the connection be deleted.
The redirector insures that there are no open file handles before deleting the
connection, but in some cases there are references on file objects themselves
and the connection is still deleted.

For example, if a shared copy of PowerPoint is installed on a network server, no
other files are opened on the connection, and the user clicks Apply Design
Template from the Format menu, PowerPoint will stop responding for a moment,
then quit. In this case, Powerpoint requested that the template share be
disconnected. That share happens to be the same one that PowerPoint.exe was
carried out from.

RESOLUTION
==========

The redirector has been modified to check for references on the file objects and
will return an error that the device is in use when an attempt is made to
disconnect the UNC connection.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51.

A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
