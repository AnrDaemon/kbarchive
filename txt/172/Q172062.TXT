TITLE   :SNADATABASE Shuts Down and Restarts During Startup
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

During the startup process of the Host Account Cache (SNADATABASE), this service
will stop, restart, and then log the following informational events in the
application log of the Event Viewer.

   Event 1325 - SNA Host Account Cache Stopped.

   Event 1324 - SNA Host Account Cache Started - Database Synchronized.

CAUSE
=====

The Master database (MDB) is not storing the name(s) of the primary domain
controller (PDC) correctly during initialization. Because this information is
not stored correctly, when the Host Account Cache checks to see if the PDC name
has changed (as it periodically does), it incorrectly concludes that it has, and
therefore it shuts down and then restarts its service.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
