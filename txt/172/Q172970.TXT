TITLE   :DMOD Does Not Recreate I/O Threads If Reinitialized
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to backup sponsors or backup domains, DMOD does not
recreate the I/O Worker threads when it reinitializes, so SnaBase fails to
connect to the backup sponsor.

CAUSE
=====

When SnaBase switches from the primary domain to the backup domain, it shuts
down the DMOD and then reinitializes it. This shutdown terminates the I/O
threads but the reinitialization does not recreate them.

RESOLUTION
==========

DMOD has been modified so that it will recreate the I/O threads when
reinitialized.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 1
(SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
