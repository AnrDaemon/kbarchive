TITLE   :Event ID 3 Logged After Application Exception in Snaservr.exe
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A connection is configured for independent LU6.2 sessions between SNA Server and
a mainframe computer. When activating this connection, the SNAServer service
(Snaservr.exe) may terminate unexpectedly, generating a Drwtsn32.log file in the
Windows NT directory.

The Drwtsn32.log file may show information similar to the following:

   

   Application exception occurred:
      App: exe\snaservr.DBG (pid=280)
      When: 4/23/1997 @ 10:43:17.118
      Exception number: 80000003 (hardcoded breakpoint)

In addition, SNA Server will log an Event ID 3 Qualifier 1106 in the Windows NT
Application Event Log:

   

   Event ID: 3
   Source: SNA Server
   Description: (1106)node configuration error
   Explanation: The SNA server (node) detected a configuration file problem
   caused by a logic error in the configuration program. These subcodes
   should not occur during normal operation.
   Sub Code Information: "X'1106'  Configuration file is corrupted".

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when SNA Server receives a BIND from the mainframe that does
not contain a Network-Qualified PLU Network Name Structured Data Subfield. The
BIND does contain a fully-qualified Network Services Primary LU Name Field, but
SNA Server ignores this. SNA Server tries to process the BIND but fails because
a remote LU data structure that is expected to be present for the
Network-Qualified PLU Network Name Structured Data Subfield is absent.

NOTE: A BIND that does not contain a Network-Qualified PLU Network Name
Structured Data Subfield is valid.

Please refer to the IBM SNA Formats Guide (GA27-3136) for more information on the
BIND.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, SNA Server functions properly when it encounters a BIND
without a Network-Qualified PLU Network Name Structured Data Subfield.
