TITLE   :WinNT Err: Stop 0x0000007F in Netbt.sys Due to #INCLUDE
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following STOP error message appears when your Windows NT 4.0 computer
attempts to load the NetBIOS name table from its Lmhosts file:

   STOP 0x0000007F (0x00000008,0x00000000,0x00000000,0x00000000)

CAUSE
=====

The Lmhosts files that you are using contain recursive loops within the #INCLUDE
statements.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, you will need to edit your Lmhosts files with a text
editor to verify that the #INCLUDE statements do not loop.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, Server1 has an Lmhosts file that contains the following entries:

   1.2.3.4   Server2 #DOM:Domain
   #INCLUDE \\Server2\public\lmhosts

Server2 may have an Lmhosts file that contains the following entries:

   2.3.4.1   Server3 #DOM:Domain
   #INCLUDE \\Server3\public\lmhosts

Server3 may have an Lmhosts file that contains the following entries:

   3.4.1.2   Server1 #DOM:Domain
   #INCLUDE \\Server1\public\lmhosts

When your Windows NT computer attempts to parse the Lmhosts file, it successively
refers to the next Lmhosts file through the #INCLUDE statement and, as in the
example above, loops back to the original file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.00.

A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
