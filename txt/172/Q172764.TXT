TITLE   :WD97: Changes to List Number Styles May be Lost
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:word97 kbnumbering

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you make changes to any of the tab or indent attributes of the List Number
or List Bullet styles, those changes may be lost when you close and restart
Word. This problem occurs even if you selected the Add to Template option in the
Modify Style dialog box (on the Format menu, click Style, and then click
Modify.)

CAUSE
=====

This functionality is by design. The bullets and numbering feature in Word is
dependent on the tab and indent attributes of the List Number and List Bullet
styles. If the tab or indent attributes of these styles are changed, the bullets
and numbering feature may work incorrectly. To prevent this from happening, Word
resets the tab and indent attributes to their default settings every time you
restart Word.

WORKAROUND
==========

Create and use a custom style instead of the List Number styles.

For more information about creating a new custom style, click Contents And Index
on the Help menu, click the Index tab in Help Topics: Microsoft Word, type the
following text

   styles, creating

and then double-click the selected text to go to the "creating and editing"
topic. If you are unable to find the information you need, ask the Office
Assistant.
