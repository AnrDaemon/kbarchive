TITLE   :PPT7: Error Editing Graph in PowerPoint 95 & 97 Dual Format File
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbgraph

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows Service Release 1 (SR-1) 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you save a PowerPoint 97 SR-1 presentation with an embedded graph in the
PowerPoint 95 & 97 dual file format, open the presentation in Microsoft
PowerPoint, version 7.0, and then double-click the graph object, you may receive
the following error message:

   The server application, source file, or item cannot be found. Make sure the
   application is properly installed, and that it has not been deleted, moved,
   or renamed.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when you save a presentation in the PowerPoint 95 & 97
dual format. PowerPoint 97 SR-1 contains a new feature that converts Graph 97
objects to the Graph 5.0 format. However, you cannot use this feature with the
PowerPoint 95 & 97 dual format. Because you cannot use Graph 5.0 to edit
Graph 97 objects, you receive this error message. (Graph 5.0 is included with
PowerPoint versions 4.0 and 7.0.)

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. In PowerPoint 97 SR-1, click Save As on the File menu.

2. In the Save As Type list, select one of the following file formats:

   PowerPoint 4.0 with Graph 5.0 (*.ppt)
   PowerPoint 95 with Graph 5.0 (*.ppt)

3. Type a new file name.

4. Click Save.

NOTE: If you edit any of the graphs using Graph 5.0, and then reopen the
presentation in PowerPoint 97 SR-1, PowerPoint automatically converts the
objects to Graph 97 format. Repeat steps 1 through 4 when you save the
presentation again.

STATUS
======

This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a future
release.
