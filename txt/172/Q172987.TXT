TITLE   :NEC 1800a CD-ROM Drive Will Not Play Audio After Applying SP3
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Windows NT Service Pack 3 (SP3) or earlier, the NEC CDR 1800a /
1224 CD-ROM drive no longer plays audio CDs. All other functionality of a CD-ROM
appears to be normal; files can be accessed and programs executed from the
CD-ROM drive.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the NEC CDR 1800a / 1224 CD-ROM drive is not fully
compatible with the Cdaudio.sys file installed by Windows NT and the Windows NT
service packs. It passed HCL testing with the provision that the Cdaudio.sys
file that is available from the Microsoft HCL site replace the one from the
source files.


RESOLUTION
==========

The updated driver is available as a downloadable file from the following Web
site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest/hcl/

Create a search with the category "Storage/CD-ROM Drive" and company "NEC." Find
the disk icon and click it to download the drivers. Replace the Cdaudio.sys file
on the computer with the one from the Web site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The NEC CDR 1800a / 1224 are produced by NEC Corp., a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
