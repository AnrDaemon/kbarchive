TITLE   :Port Values for TN5250 Don't Work If One Is Set to Use Default
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you are setting the port numbers for AS/400 definitions, if multiple ports
are used and one is left at Use Default, all ports will connect to the AS/400
with the definition set to Use Default. This port setting is found in the TN5250
AS/400 Definition on the Terminal Types property page in SNA Server Manager. For
example, set up two AS/400 definitions with definition A set to use port 24 and
definition B set to Use Default in the port setting. When a TN5250 client
initiates a session, it will go to AS/400 definition B with the Use Default port
setting, even if assigned to AS/400 definition A.

CAUSE
=====

When determining which AS/400 definition the TN5250 client was assigned to, a
check by TN5250.EXE finds a default port entered in an AS/400 definition and
erroneously assigns all clients to the default setting.

RESOLUTION
==========

TN5250.EXE has been modified to assign the proper AS/400 definition to the
client requesting a session when a "Use Default" port setting exists in any
TN5250 AS/400 definition.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
