TITLE   :Expectation of Unbind Response Can Cause Application Failure
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11,3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If an LUA RUI application does not respond to an UNBIND request, SNA Server will
abend the application.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server requires an LUA RUI application to respond to an UNBIND request
before allowing a new session to be bound to the LU. Some applications are not
written to respond to this request. For example CM/2 does not have this
requirement.

RESOLUTION
==========

A new registry entry has been added to the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\ 
   Snabase\Parameters\Client

The new entry is DontWaitUnbindResponse. If it is present and set to any numeric
value, SNA Server will not expect a response to the UNBIND from the application.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 3.0 and 3.0 Service
Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
