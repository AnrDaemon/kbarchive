TITLE   :SMS: Delete Special Still Available with View-Only Access
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage kbsmsAdmin smsadmin

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a user has restricted rights (set through the Systems Management Server
Security Manager) to view only Personal Computer Properties, the user is still
able to see a Delete Special menu option. The user is also able to select the
Delete Special command; however, nothing is deleted from the database.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the user first enters the Systems Management Server Administrator program,
he or she will see the Delete Special menu option under the Edit menu. The user
can select the option, but no systems are removed from the database. After the
user has viewed the personal properties of a computer, the Delete Special menu
option is no longer available on the Edit menu.
