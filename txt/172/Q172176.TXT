SUMMARY
=======

By default, the Open and Save As dialog boxes (on the File menu, click Open, or
Save As) list files in ascending order, sorted by name. This article describes
how to list files in descending order, and how to sort by file size, file type,
or date modified.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To change the default sort order in the Open or Save As dialog boxes, follow
these steps:

1. On the File menu, click Open for the Open dialog box, or Save As for the Save
   As dialog box.

2. In the dialog box that is displayed, click the Commands and Settings toolbar
   button (the last button on the right), and then click Sorting.

3. Under Sort Files By, click to select to a choice in the drop-down list:

   Name, Size, Type, or Modified.

4. Click either Ascending or Descending, and then click OK.

NOTE: Sorting preferences in the Open and Save As dialog boxes are separate.
Changes made in one dialog box are not reflected in the other.

For more information about sorting files, click the Office Assistant, type "How
do I sort files?" (without the quotation marks), click Search, and then click to
view the "Sort a list of files" topic.
