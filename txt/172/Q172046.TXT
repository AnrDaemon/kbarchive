   INTRODUCTION
   ------------

   This utility is designed to correct an error in the Stdprf.inf file in
   the Outlook Deployment Kit, found on the April Select CD-ROM. It should    not be used in any other version of the Outlook Deployment Kit.

   The Olodkupd.exe file contains the following files:

   Odkupd.exe   The patch that corrects the error in the Stdprf.inf file
   Readme.txt   Information about the patch and instructions for manually
                correcting the error

   SYMPTOMS
   --------
   Outlook 98 client installations created with the Outlook 98 Deployment
   Kit that shipped with the April 1, 1998 Select CD-ROM will fail to     correctly register as the default mail client. Mailto: URLs and Internet
   Explorer's "Mail" button will not function properly.

   This is a result of a single, missing quotation in two copies of the
   Outlook 98 Deployment Kit file Stdprf.inf. If the Created Date = March
   12, 1998 of either of the Stdprf.inf files on your computer, select one
   of the methods below to correct the problem.

   Method 1
   --------

   To correct this problem automatically, run Odkupd.exe. It replaces both
   copies of the Stdprf.inf file.

   Method 2
   --------

   To correct this problem manually, follow the steps below.

   NOTE: You must do this before you use the Outlook Deployment Kit. If you
   already deployed an Outlook 98 Client installation, you must rebuild it.

   1. Locate both copies of Stdprf.inf. The default locations are:

         \Program Files\ODK\olbin\ 

         - and -

         \Program Files\ODK\olbin\en\optional\ 

   2. Open each file in a text editor, such as Notepad.

   3. Locate the following line:

        Q=""

      Replace that line with:

        Q="""

   4. Save and close the file.
