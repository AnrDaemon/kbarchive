SUMMARY
=======

This article lists the registry entries used by Winpopup.exe in Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The registry entries for Winpopup.exe are stored in the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Applets\ 
      Popup

Winpopup Registry Entries
-------------------------

AlwaysOnTop:

   Specifies that the Winpopup window is in front.

MaxOnMsgRcv:

   Specifies that Winpopup is maximized when a message is received.

MultiUserWarn:

   Specifies that a warning should be given if <user name> is already
   logged on to the network. Because Winpopup uses <user name> for
   broadcast messages, if you are logged on at more than one computer,
   <computer name> must be specified for messages to reach a computer.

Sound:

   Specifies that Winpopup plays the default sound to announce receipt of
   a message.

All values are Binary values with the following format:

   Value        Description
   ------------------------
   0000 00 00   Disabled
   0000 01 00   Enabled

Because of the structure of the registry key listed above, Regedit shows these
values as "Invalid DWORD value." However, this does not prevent the key from
being used.
