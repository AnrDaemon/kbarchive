CAUSE
=====

A 3270 emulator is failing to send element data in an OPEN PLU response to the
SNA Server. SNA Server is not expecting such an invalid message, which leads to
an access violation.

NOTE: This problem is a symptom of a 3270 emulator logic error. It was not
determined which 3270 emulator causes this problem, because this was only
observed once at one customer site.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.11, 2.11
SP1, and 2.11 SP2.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, and 3.0
SP1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, if the SNA Server receives an invalid OPEN PLU response
(containing no element data), the message is ignored and the following error is
logged to the Windows NT application event log:

   

   Event ID: 9
   Source:  SNA Server
   Description: (1117) Internal Message Sequence Error

   EXPLANATION:
   Invalid or unexpected message received by the SNA Server (node) from
   another SNA Server component (for example, the emulator or link service)

   SUBCODE
   X'1117'   Received an invalid message from a 3270 emulator

NOTE: There are various causes of the Event 9 error. To determine the cause of
the error, capture an SNA Server DLC and 3270 message trace on the server.
