TITLE   :Duplicate HSD Causes Incorrect Error Using "Insert" Option
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you manually create a host security domain (HSD) using the "Insert" option
in SNA Server Manager, the following error message appears if there is already
an HSD with the same name.

   The NT local group <HSD_Name> already exist. Do you want to add
   a new Host Security Domain for it? Yes, No

If you click No, the program closes. If you click Yes, the following error
message appears:

   Failed to connect to the SNA Host Account Cache. Host Security
   Domains cannot be added at present.

In the application log of the event viewer, the following stop error message
appears:

   Event ID 1315
   Source: SNA Host Security

   An attempt was made to add a pre-existing domain to the database
   supplied code 0

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server is reporting an incorrect error message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,

MORE INFORMATION
================

The logging of the Event 1315 is a valid and correct message; however the error
messages are misleading and incorrect. The correct message that should be
received is the same message that appears when you are using the HSD Wizard:

   Host Security Domain <HSD_Name> already exists.
   Please choose a different name.
