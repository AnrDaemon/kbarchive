KEYWORDS:winword word97 kbwdinternet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you select and delete your Web browser from the list of browsers in the Web
Page Preview dialog box (on the File menu, click Web Page Preview) and close and
then re-open the Web Page Preview dialog box, the browser you deleted still
appears in the list of browsers.

NOTE: The list of browsers appears after you install the update for the Web Page
Authoring Tools when you click Web Page Preview on the File menu.

CAUSE
=====

Word lists all registered Web browsers in the Web Page Preview dialog box.

NOTE: A registered Web browser is a Web browser that is properly installed and
has the correct Windows Registry entries for Word to correctly identify and use
the browser.

STATUS
======

This functionality is by design. Word automatically identifies and uses a Web
browser that has been registered in the Windows Registry.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Registration of a Web browser in the Windows Registry is a function of the setup
of the Web browser. If your Web browser is not recognized by Word, either rerun
the setup program for your Web browser, or contact the vendor of your Web
browser for more information.
