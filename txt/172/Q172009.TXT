TITLE   :WINS Server Experiences Slow Performance
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.5,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You have network clients using Cheyenne's ArcServe client and your Windows
Internet Name Service (WINS) server on your network may stop responding to all
name queries. The network clients have both a primary and secondary WINS server
specified in their TCP/IP properties.

CAUSE
=====

Cheyenne ArcServe has a feature known as Auto Discovery mode, that allows the
software to discover all clients on the network. Unfortunately, the Auto
Discovery mode causes enormous amounts of queries against the primary and
secondary WINS servers.


RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

To resolve this issue, you will need to edit the registry using the following
steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and select the following subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Cheyenne\ARCserve\CurrentVersion
   \ServerRecord

2. Click BCastType, from the Edit menu, click DWORD.

3. Type 0, and then click OK.

4. Close Registry Editor and restart the computer.
