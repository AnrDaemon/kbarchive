TITLE   :PRB: Alpha Platform Not Available When Adding Configurations

KEYWORDS:kbdocerr kbide kbVC kbVC500 kbVC600 kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you move a project from the Intel platform to the Alpha RISC platform and
attempt to add a new Alpha configuration (for example, by selecting
Build|Configurations...|Add... from the Developer Studio menu) Developer Studio
does not provide an option to choose "Win32(Alpha)" in the platform combo box.

CAUSE
=====

Visual C++ RISC Edition is not a cross-development environment, but rather a
native-development environment and is, therefore, not presented as a unique
configuration platform. Additional platforms are only available in the Platforms
combo box if they produce code that runs on a platform other than the native
environment. Examples of this are the Visual C++ development environments for
Apple Macintosh and Windows CE. These platform types must be built on the Intel
platform, but they produce code that only runs on their respective platform
architectures.

RESOLUTION
==========

In native Visual C++ development environments, simply add a "Win32" platform and
use the configuration name to identify the platform. For example, you might use
the names "AlphaRelease" and "AlphaDebug" on the Alpha platform.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Under Visual C++ version 4.0 RISC Edition, the Win32 platform name is displayed
as "Win32 (platform)". For example, "Win32 (MIPS)", "Win32 (ALPHA)", etc.

The Visual C++ 5.0 documentation incorrectly implies that the platforms will be
presented in a similar manner.

An existing 4.x project that contains the Win32 (platform) form of the
configuration name will retain this name when migrated to Visual C++ version
5.0.
