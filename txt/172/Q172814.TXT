PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.1,3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

There is no Control Unit Image Number support for ESCON-type channel
connections.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server was not originally written to provide direct support for ESCON
connections.

RESOLUTION
==========

A Control Unit Image Number field has been added to connections using a
channel-type link service. The field is found on the Address tab of the
connection. It is an integer with a default value of 0 and a range of 0- 0xF.
The Control Unit Image Number is ignored when using Bus&Tag channel- type
links.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
