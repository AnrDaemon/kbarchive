The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

With the latest version of the Remote Control Agent service for client computers
running Windows NT, Systems Management Server now has the capability to add
registry entries to enable the service to create a log file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To enable logging, perform the following steps:

1. Open the client registry to HKLM\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Tracing.

2. Create a key called HELPDESK.

3. Add a value called Enabled (REG_DWORD) and set it to 0 for no logging, 1 for
   logging, or 2 for Console Debugger.

   NOTE: If either the HELPDESK key or the Enabled value does not exist, nothing
   out of the ordinary will happen.

4. Just as with other Systems Management Server services, you can also define
   the optional values TraceFileName (REG_SZ) and MaxFileSize (REG_DWORD, # of
   bytes).

   NOTE: If these values do not exist, TraceFileName defaults to C:\Ldmdbg.log
   and MaxFileSize will be 1 MB. When the log file reaches the value specified
   by MaxFileSize, it will be renamed to "*.*_" and a new one will be created.
