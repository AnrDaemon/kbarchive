TITLE   :SMP Server Fails with Stop 0xA During Browser Shutdown
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your system may fail and the following STOP message in Rdr.sys appears:

   **** STOP 0x0000000A

CAUSE
=====

If the browser service is shut down during an election, a failure may occur. A
scheduled process performed a net use * /d command while logged on as the local
system account. This disconnected the IPC$ null session. This removes RPC
communication that the browser service relies on for communication with other
servers. The same effect can be observed while shutting down the browser. In
order for the failure to occur, an election must take place at this point and
the server must be a multiprocessor system.

RESOLUTION
==========

Configure the system so that the batch processes run by the scheduling services
will not be performed under the context of the system account. The net use /d
command specifying * or \\server\ipc$ are the commands that must not be carried
out. By preventing the carrying out of such commands, the browser will not
experience these problems.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.

A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Product
Support Services for more information.
