TITLE   :Character Strings For 3270 Logon Scripting Aren't Localized
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Some character strings used by the logon script process in the SNA Server-J 3.0
SP1 version of the 3270 Applet display in English instead of Japanese.

RESOLUTION
==========

The character strings which were hard-coded in English were moved from the
source codes to resource files. The Logon script process now properly handles
these characters for the Japanese version of the 3270 applet.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server, versions
3.0 and 3.0 SP1.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Product
Support Services for more information.
