======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade from Windows NT 3.51 to Windows NT 4.0, the following error may
occur:

   Stop 0x00000050 ( 0xf4060000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000 )
   Page Fault in Non Paged Area.

The first parameter may vary depending on the computer configuration, but the
last three should be all 0's.

CAUSE
=====

This error is generated by files related to Compaq's Insight Manager version
2.61 or 3.0.

WORKAROUND
==========

Rename the following files found in %SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers;

Cpqsdm.sys - which is the SCSI Device Manager
Sysmgmt.sys - which is the Systems Management Driver

After renaming the files, restart your computer to allow setup to proceed.

NOTE: You may encounter additional error messages relating to Insight Manager.

If the file system is NTFS, a parallel copy of Windows NT will need to be
installed into a temporary directory. After Windows NT is installed and the
files renamed, restart the computer and choose the original installation from
the Boot.ini menu to continue the upgrade process.

After the upgrade is completed, it is recommended that Insight Manager be
reinstalled, apply any Windows NT 4.0 service packs that may be needed, and then
apply the latest SSD from Compaq.

It is recommended that for Windows NT 4.0, that Insight Manager version 3.3 or
later be used.
