TITLE   :Deleting 3270 Pool May Result in Unnamed Pool in SNA Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you delete a 3270 pool using SNA Server Manager, the pool name appears as
a dash (-) and the 3270 pooled LUs still appear in Manager. After the 3270 LU
Pool is deleted, a dash (-) appears in the left pane of the Manager window under
the Pools folder. In the right pane of the window there is a 3270 LU Pool
without a name associated with it. If you try to delete this "unnamed" pool, SNA
Server Manager closes without warning. If SNA Server Manager is closed before
you try to delete the Pool, the LU Pool will not be shown when SNA Server
Manager is restarted.

CAUSE
=====

The internal data structures in SnaExp.exe contain an incorrect pointer when a
pool is first viewed under a configured user before it is viewed in the pool
folder.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
