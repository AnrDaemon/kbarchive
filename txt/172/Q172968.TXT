MORE INFORMATION
================

Chapter 4, "Managing MSCS," in the MSCS Administrator's Guide contains a section
called "Recovering Disk-Subsystem Failures." Because MSCS version 1.0 does not
support software RAID, this section may not apply.

Recovery procedures for hardware RAID may be specific to the RAID implementation.
For these procedures, consult the documentation provided with your hardware, or
consult with the hardware vendor.
