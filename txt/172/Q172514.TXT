======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) adds support to Windows NT Workstation 4.0
for the following feature:

 - Silent Routing Information Protocol (RIP)

MORE INFORMATION
================

RIP is a routing protocol that allows routers to exchange route tables so
clients can use the best possible route to transfer data to servers on different
subnets. Silent RIP is the passive mode of this protocol whereby a router will
listen to advertised routes from other routers, but does not actively advertise
its own routes.

Previous to SP4, Microsoft has provided no support for RIP in Windows NT
Workstation, only in Windows NT Server. This new feature will only be of value
when local routers are using RIP version 1 broadcasts.



For more information on Service Pack 4, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base.
