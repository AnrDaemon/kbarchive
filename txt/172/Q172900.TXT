PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client will hang after the color is changed in
the message dialog box when used with Macintosh OS 8.


WORKAROUND
==========

To change colors, you will have to use the Macintosh 7.x OS because there is no
workaround for this problem under Macintosh OS 8.

Once you are in this situation, you must "Force Quit" using the Command+Option+
esc keys on the keyboard and all unsaved changes will be lost.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug and is currently working with Apple
Computer to resolve this problem. More information will be posted here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
