TITLE   :Print Server Does Not Honor Print Properties Set In Dialog
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you select the font override properties for a 3270 print session, several
settings are not reflected in the print output. For example Bold, Italic, Bold
Italic, Underline, and Strikeout do not print when you select them in the Font
dialog box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

   S E R V P A C K


MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, this functionality is available through this dialog box.
Note these characteristics will be applied to the entire print job and will not
work if a PDT file is used. Font properties are ignored if a PDT is set up
because the GDI interface is no longer used. Some fonts do not support bold or
italic, and other fonts are indistinguishable as bold or non-bold.
