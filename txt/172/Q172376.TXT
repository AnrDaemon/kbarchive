TITLE   :PRB: Ddcerr.log Reports "DDCONV initializing" During Upgrade
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe500

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

DDCONV produces a Ddcerr.log file that contains only "DDCONV Initializing" when
upgrading a Visual SourceSafe 4.x installation.

CAUSE
=====

DDCONV does not have to go through the usual conversion routines for a database
that is in 4.x format, because the structure of the database files did not
change from versions 4.x to 5.x. The only difference was the addition of a 128
byte unique identifier in the Um.dat file. This identifier is not added during
the DDCONV session.

RESOLUTION
==========

No action is required. The database should function normally under Visual
SourceSafe version 5.0.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The normal output in the Ddcerr.log file after a successful conversion of a
non-version 4.x database is as follows:

   DDCONV initializing
   Creating subfolders
   Moving files
   Creating rights DB
   Building project list
   Creating names DB
   Converting log files
   Adding project rights
   Converting users
   DDCONV finished
