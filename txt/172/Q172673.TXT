TITLE   :BUG: Control Unexpectedly Gains Focus When Made Visible
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set the Visible property of a control to True at run-time, the active
control loses focus. The control for which you changed the Visible property
gains the focus.

This problem occurs with the Sheridan 3D controls (SSRibbon, SOption, SSPanel,
SSCommand, SSFrame and SSCheck).

NOTE: This problem will occur with other controls created with the MFC Control
FrameWork.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, set the focus back to the control that was active
prior to changing the Visible property of the Sheridan 3D control. The following
code illustrates how you can restore focus to the active control after changing
the Visible property of a SSPanel control:

      Dim ctrl as Control

      Set ctrl = ActiveControl
      SSPanel1.Visible = True
      ctrl.SetFocus

NOTE: This code does not prevent the LostFocus and GotFocus event from firing
when focus is inadvertently set to the Sheridan 3D control.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open a new "Standard EXE" project.

2. Click Components on the Project menu. Check "Sheridan 3D Controls"
   (THREED32.OCX) and click OK.

   NOTE: If you do not have THREED32.OCX installed, refer to README.TXT in the
   \Tools\Controls directory of your Visual Basic 5.0 CD-ROM.

3. Add an SSPanel control and a TextBox control to Form1.

4. Set the Visible property of the SSPanel control to False.

5. Add the following code to the Click event of Form1.

         SSPanel1.Visible = True
         Debug.Print ActiveControl.Name

6. Press the F5 key to run the application.

7. Set the focus to Text1 and then click the Form. Notice that the SSPanel
   control has the focus and not Text1 as expected.
