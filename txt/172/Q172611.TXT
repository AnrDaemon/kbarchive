TITLE   :FTP Client Fails to Suppress Remote Server Responses Using -V
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client with the -v command-line
option, the remote server responses may display even though they are supposed to
be suppressed.

CAUSE
=====

When using redirected input to the FTP command line, verbose mode has a default
setting of OFF. In this scenario, the -v parameter toggles verbose mode to a
setting of ON.

RESOLUTION
==========

The only known workaround for this issue is to use separate commands for your
processes. For example, when you need to execute the FTP client with redirected
input, then do not use the -v parameter. When you need to execute the FTP client
without the redirected input, then use the -v parameter to suppress the remote
server responses.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
