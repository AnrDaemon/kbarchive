OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you install an SNA Client Upgrade over an existing SNA Client, the
configuration information must be re-entered. This behavior is not expected; the
SNA Client should use the pre-existing information. All versions of the SNA
Client Upgrade ignore the configuration information.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Client Upgrade ignores the previous install settings.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following word in

MORE INFORMATION

With the fix applied, the SNA Client Upgrade initializes with the previous
install settings.
