PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp500 kbVBp600 kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 6.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 6.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 6.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Opening an entire Excel 4.0 Worksheet, according to the syntax described in
Books Online and according to the syntax used in all previous versions of Visual
Basic, will cause Run-time error '3011.'

RESOLUTION
==========

For a workaround, modify the Source argument for the OpenRecordset method from
FILENAME#XLS to FILENAME$. Please see below for an illustration.

      Set db = OpenDatabase("c:\file.xls", False, False, "Excel 4.0;HDR=NO;")
      Set rs = db.OpenRecordset("file$")

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The syntax specified in Books Online for working with Excel Worksheets and
Workbooks is consistent with the documentation for all previous versions of
Visual Basic.

Other than opening entire Excel 4.0 Worksheets, no other problems are known to
exist at this time. In fact, opening a named range in an Excel 4.0 Worksheet
will work just as described.
