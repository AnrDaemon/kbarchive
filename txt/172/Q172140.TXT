TITLE   :Verity Search '97 Causes IIS Authentication to Fail
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Internet Information Server (IIS) systems with Verity Search '97 installed may
fail with the following symptoms:

 - Verity Search'97 fails to operate with Anonymous password authentication
   disabled.

 - No users (except administrators) can authenticate with Basic (Clear Text)
   password authentication, while NT Challenge/Response works fine.

 - No users can access secure NTFS directories, including administrators.

CAUSE
=====

Verity Search'97 installs a new authentication filter in the Microsoft Windows
NT Server system registry. This filter, Authfilt.dll, is installed by Verity
Search'97 in:

   \\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\
   Services\W3SVC\Parameters

According to Verity, this filter fails to work correctly with IIS.

WORKAROUND
==========

Please refer to the Verity FAQ ID:10218.0: "Using NT Authentication with your
Search'97 Information Server 3.0 Install."
