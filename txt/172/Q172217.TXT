PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:3.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you have more than 1000 WWW virtual directories, you may get the following
error message when an Active Server Page (ASP) is accessed:

   Invalid Application Name

CAUSE
=====

You may have supplied a wrong path.

ASP can only support up to 1000 WWW virtual directories.

NOTE: This is hard coded in the ASP code.


RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has produced a fix which allows the 1000 virtual directory upper limit
to be changed via a registry entry.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Server version 3.0.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.



MORE INFORMATION
================

The hotfix for ASP now has a new registry entry to ASP that allows you to change
the upper limit that how many WWW virtual directories ASP can support.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Microsoft Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry
Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

To change the upper limit, do the following steps:

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Go to the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3SVC\ASP\Parameters

3. Click Add Value on the Edit menu. Use the following entry:

   Value Name: MaxVroots
   Data Type:  REG_DWORD
   Value:      a number which is larger than the number of WWW
   virtual directories (default 1000).

4. Exit the Registry Editor and restart the IIS for the change to take effect.
