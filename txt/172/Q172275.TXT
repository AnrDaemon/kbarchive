      For Each Form in Forms
      'Find each form that is not the current form
        If Form.Name <> Me. Name Then
          Form. Enabled = True ' and Disable it
        End If
      End Sub

      Private Sub Form_Unload()

      ' Loop thru each form in the FormS collection
      For Each Form in Forms

      'Re-enable all the forms in the FormS collection
        If Form.Name <> Me. Name Then
          Form. Enabled = True
      End If

      End Sub

STATUS
