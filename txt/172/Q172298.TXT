TITLE   :SNA Manager Redraws TN5250 IP Address List Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If a name that is longer than the column width for the IP Address field is added
to a TN5250 AS/400 definition, the name is not redrawn correctly if the column
width is subsequently resized. The overflow part of the name is truncated and
appears in the Subnet Mask column. The overflow part of the name stays in the
Subnet Mask even the if column is resized.

CAUSE
=====

The TN5250 portion of SNA Manager fails to redraw the column correctly to an Add
Name entry. Instead of not showing any overflow in the Subnet Mask column, the
extra characters stay on screen.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and
3.0.Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, SNA Manager redraws the columns correctly. Any overflow
from the long name is not displayed in the Subnet Mask column.
