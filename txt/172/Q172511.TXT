TITLE   :Stop 0x0000000A w/ Services for Macintosh & McAfee Anti-Virus
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a system runs Services for Macintosh and McAfee Anti-Virus software, you
may receive a blue screen STOP 0xA error or errors similar to the following:

   STOP: 0x0000000a (0x00000004, 0x00000002, 0x00000001, 0x8010b262)

   STOP: 0x0000000a (0x00000004 0x00000002 0x00000001 0x8010b262)
   IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL

   STOP: 0x00000024 (0x001901f9 0xf5c27c0c 0xf5c27a48 0x8010b260)
   NTFS_FILE_SYSTEM

CAUSE
=====

McAfee Anti-Virus software uses a filter driver. The presence of a filter driver
requires system drivers to allocate additional stack space in I/O request
packets (IRPs). An IRP in use by Services for Macintosh had insufficient space
for insertion of filter driver stack information. The result was the STOP 0xA
error message.
