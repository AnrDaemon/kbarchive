TITLE   :WD97: General Document Properties Incorrect During Save
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you save a document for the first time, and the Prompt For Document
Properties option is selected, the General tab of the Document Properties dialog
box contains incorrect information or no information at all.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. Word fills in the information on the General tab of
the Document Properties dialog box before the save actually occurs. For
example:

 - When you name a document for the first time, the information on the General
   tab of the Document Properties dialog box is blank.

   -or-

 - When you perform a Save As operation and rename the document, the information
   on the General tab of the Document Properties dialog box is from the previous
   Save.

WORKAROUND
==========

Save your document first, and then check the document properties by clicking
Properties on the File menu.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Word can display the Document Properties dialog box the first time it saves a
document. This allows you to enter information about the document, such as a
title, keywords, or comments.

To set these properties at any other time, click Properties on the File menu.
