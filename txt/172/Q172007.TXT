PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Kids Products
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores the Rainforest for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Magic School Bus (MSB) Explores the Rainforest hangs at the Driver's License
screen after you click the Snake to exit the bus. Your pointer remains an
hourglass, the background music continues to play, and the CD-ROM drive is
continually accessed.

When you press the CTRL+ALT+DELETE key combination on your keyboard to open the
Close Program dialog box, MSB Rainforest is shown as not responding.

NOTE: On some computers, the program will eventually continue to the next screen
if left for a few minutes.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs if you are using real mode (MS-DOS) CD-ROM drivers.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, update your real mode CD-ROM drivers to Windows 32-bit
protected-mode CD-ROM drivers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows protected-mode drivers should be available from the CD-ROM drive
manufacturer. Some protected-mode CD-ROM drivers are available in Windows.

For additional information about loading protected mode CD-ROM drivers, see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
