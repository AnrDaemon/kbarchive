SUMMARY
=======

If you send a message using a Microsoft Mail custom form from one server to a
server that does not have that form installed, the notifier screen does not
appear when that message arrives.

This problem occurs because the alert screen description is stored in the form;
no alert can be generated because the form is not installed on the receiving
server. Once the form is installed on the receiving server, notification will
occur normally.

If the notifier window is not displaying when any message is received, it may be
that the "Display notifier window" option is not selected in the Preferences
dialog box. To check this, choose Preferences from the Mail menu and make sure
that there is a check in the box before the Display Notifier Window option.
