TITLE   :PRB: /PACKCODE Incompatible with IOPL Segments w/ LINK 5.01.21
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER:OS/2:5.01.21
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft LINK for OS/2, version 5.01.21 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

LINK Version 5.01.21 does not support the combination of using the /PACKCODE
switch and having code segments declared as IOPL (i.e., as having I/O
privilege).

When combining segments as directed by the /PACKCODE option, LINK 5.01.21 will
combine the IOPL segment(s) with other segments that do not have I/O privilege.
The result is an invalid executable that returns the system error SYS1059 when
it is invoked.

STATUS
======

The lack of ability to combine these options is a limitation of this particular
linker version. LINK Version 5.03 allows the combination of /PACKCODE and IOPL
segments without a problem.
