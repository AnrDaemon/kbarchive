SUMMARY
=======

In the file MACRO.DOC on the "Microsoft CodeView for MS-DOS with Tutorial" disk
for Microsoft Macro Assembler Version 5.10, there is a documentation error that
incorrectly calls the macro @MakeFil.

The macro is defined in the DOS.INC include file, also on the MS-DOS CodeView
disk. In the DOS.INC include file, the @MakeFil macro has been labeled as
@MakFil, not @MakeFil.

To use this macro correctly, either change the DOS.INC include file macro label
to @MakeFil, or call the macro as @MakFil.

Additional query words: 5.10 MAKEFILE
