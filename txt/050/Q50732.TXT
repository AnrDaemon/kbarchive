SUMMARY
=======

Code that declares a pointer to a nonexistent structure compiles without warning
or error. This is correct behavior.

Note that dereferencing a pointer to an undefined structure, or attempting to use
a field, will produce errors. In general, you are allowed to make a reference to
an undefined struct as long as the operation doesn't need to know the size of
that struct or the names of its fields. This method of declaration is commonly
used in linked lists.

Sample Code
-----------

      void main (void)
      {
         struct non_existent *ptr;         // legal
         struct x
         {
          struct x *previous;      // legal, note that struct x is
          struct x *next;          // not yet defined
         };
      }
