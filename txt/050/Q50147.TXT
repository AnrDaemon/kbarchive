SUMMARY
=======

An AppleTalk bridge links two AppleTalk networks with the same ID. It is
commonly used to overcome the AppleTalk limitation of 32 nodes per segment. With
a bridge, the AppleTalk segment is split into two segments (with the same ID),
allowing each segment to hold 32 nodes.

NOTE: Depending on the type of connectors, cable, and topology you are using,
each AppleTalk segment can expand a signal up to a fixed cable length.

An AppleTalk router links two AppleTalk networks with different IDs. It is
commonly used to connect different AppleTalk networks on a local area network
(LAN). For example, in a company X, the Sales department has an AppleTalk
network (with ID = 10) and the Inventory department has another one (with ID =
20). An AppleTalk router can link these two AppleTalk networks.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are several brands of bridges and routers used with AppleTalk networks;
some can act as both a bridge and/or a router. If you want to know about some of
these devices, please contact your local Apple dealer. Microsoft does not sell
any bridges or routers for AppleTalk networks.
