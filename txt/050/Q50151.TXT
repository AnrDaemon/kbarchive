SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail Server is a start-up (INIT) document that loads into the
Macintosh's memory on start-up.

Start-up documents load into memory alphabetically. If a message is displayed at
start-up explaining that the server cannot start because there is not enough
memory for it to load, you must remove some of the start-up documents that are
being loaded before the Microsoft Mail Server file.

If some of the removed start-up documents are needed on the server Macintosh, the
amount of memory dedicated to the Server file can be lowered to free more space
for the other start-up documents.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To lower the memory allocation of the Server file, do the following:

1. After the server starts, put the start-up documents that are needed back in
   the System Folder and sign in to Mail as the Network Manager.

2. From the Mail menu, choose Server Settings and lower the memory allocation
   setting in the Server Settings dialog box.

3. Click the Update button. The server will restart, and both the start-up
   documents and Server file will load (if the server allocation is low enough).
