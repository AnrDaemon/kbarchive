TITLE   :PRB: L1092: Cannot Open Module-Definition File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.03,5.15
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS, versions 5.03, 5.15 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to link an application fails and Microsoft LINK generates the
following message:

   Link: fatal error L1092: cannot open module-definition file

CAUSE
=====

Incorrect or unintentional input is given on the Definitions File prompt during
linking, or a response file incorrectly feeds input to the Definitions File
prompt.

RESOLUTION
==========

Specify the correct name for a module-definition (DEF) file on the linker
command line or accept the default, NUL.DEF.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A module-definition file is a text file that describes the name, attributes,
exports, imports, system requirements and other characteristics of an
application or dynamic-link library (DLL) for the Microsoft Windows or OS/2
operating system. This file is required to build a dynamic-link library (DLL)
and is optional (but desirable) for an application. By default, LINK assumes
that no definition file is required. To link an application for MS-DOS, use a
semicolon character to terminate the command line before the definition file
field or accept NUL.DEF at the Definitions File prompt.

When you use commas to separate the names of libraries in a response file, LINK
assumes that the first comma separates the list of libraries from the
module-definition file field. The L1092 error occurs because LINK assumes that
the plus sign (+) is the name of the DEF file.

When you use semicolons to separate the names of libraries in a response file,
LINK does not read any data after the first semicolon. LINK ignores all
specified options when a semicolon is the first character encountered in the
libraries field.

Additional query words: def file
