The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22

SUMMARY
=======

The asterisk (*) wildcard character cannot be placed before a static string in a
wildcard search path. When the MS-DOS file search routines find an asterisk
wildcard character in a path, the routines fill the remaining filename field
with the question-mark (?) wildcard character. When this happens, any static
text in the filename following the asterisk is discarded.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, the following wildcard string:

   FIL*NAM.*

is interpreted by MS-DOS as follows:

   FIL?????.???

This string finds all files starting with the character string "FIL" instead of
all files beginning with "FIL" and ending with "NAM" and having a non-specific
number and type of characters between "FIL" and "NAM." To find the files as
described above, three separate searches must be made. These searches are as
follows:

   FILNAM.*
   FIL?NAM.*
   FIL??NAM.*

Additional query words: 6.22 3.20 3.21 3.30 3.30a 4.00 4.01 5.00a 5.00 6.00 6.20
