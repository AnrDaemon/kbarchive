SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft FORTRAN includes GRAPHICS.LIB, a run-time library that supports a
number of graphics functions in the MS-DOS environment. The OS/2 graphics
library, GRTEXTP.LIB, supports the subset of the graphics functions that perform
text graphics. The text below lists the functions that GRTEXTP.LIB supports:

   clearscreen        getvideoconfig    settextposition
   displaycursor      getvisualpage     settextrows
   getactivepage      outtext           settextwindow
   getbkcolor         setactivepage     setvideomode
   gettextcolor       setbkcolor        setvideomoderows
   gettextcursor      settextcolor      setvisualpage
   gettextposition    settextcursor     wrapon

To use graphics in an application designed to run with OS/2, link the GRTEXTP.LIB
library instead of GRAPHICS.LIB. Functions not included in the list above are
not available in OS/2.

To perform additional graphics operations in an application developed for the
OS/2 operating system, use the functions of the OS/2 Presentation Manager.

For more information, see the Microsoft FORTRAN "Advanced Topics" manual. For
FORTRAN version 5.1, see page 190 and for FORTRAN version 5.0, see page 148.
