In Microsoft Windows Write, when you press the PAGE DOWN key while the
cursor is in the middle of a picture (not selected) and a picture is
on the next screen, the display moves to the new screen and then moves
back. The cursor does not move. Repeating this action does not move
the cursor. Clicking below the control bar on the right side of the
window works correctly.

Additional query words: 3.0 3.00 3.10 3.11
