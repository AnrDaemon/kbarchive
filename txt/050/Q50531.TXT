The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, MS-DOS workstation, versions 1.37, 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To use Microsoft Mail (PC Client) with AppleShare PC version 2.0, you must first
load the COMPAT.COM utility (provided with AppleShare PC 2.0) into memory.

AppleShare PC 2.0 uses a new protocol set that allows AppleTalk devices to
communicate with each other (AppleTalk Phase 2). PC Client Mail is designed to
work with AppleTalk Phase 1 protocol. COMPAT.COM must translate the older
protocol so that it is compatible with AppleTalk Phase 2 protocol.

If you attempt to run PC Client Mail without installing COMPAT.COM, Mail cannot
locate the AppleTalk driver, and the following message is displayed:

   You need to load the AppleTalk device driver software before starting Mail

MORE INFORMATION
================

COMPAT.COM tells PC Client Mail that the AppleTalk driver is loaded at software
interrupt address 60. If the MAIL.INI file contains the line INT=xx, where xx is
not equal to 60, Mail will not locate the AppleTalk driver at the correct
software address, and you will still receive the message "You need to load the
AppleTalk device driver software before starting Mail."
