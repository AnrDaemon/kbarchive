TITLE   :Flt Sim: Plane Accelerates While Taxiing

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

Once you cut the throttle while taxiing the plane, the plane continues to
accelerate until the airspeed indicator indicates 40 knots.

To work around this problem, use the throttle sparingly during taxiing
operations, and apply brakes as needed to reduce forward motion. Even though the
plane does not slow down as soon as would be optimal, this condition does
encourage some good pilot habits, such as sparing use of the throttle and brakes
during taxiing.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Flight Simulator versions 4.00
and 4.00a. This problem was corrected in Flight Simulator version 4.00b.
