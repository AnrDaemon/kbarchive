SUMMARY
=======

With the Microsoft C compiler, the choice to use the /F compiler option or the
/STACK linker option to specify a stack size for a program depends on the method
being used to compile and link.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you using the CL command to compile and link, the /F compiler option is all
that is necessary. This option will pass the correct size of the stack to the
linker.

Conversely, if you are invoking the compiler and the linker separately (as in a
MAKE file), the /STACK link option can be used to get the desired stack size.

No stack information is stored in the object module. Therefore, using the /F and
/c (compile only) options together and then invoking link separately will not
generate the desired stack size.

For OS/2, Windows, Windows NT, and Windows 95 applications, the stack size can be
specified in the .DEF file using the STACKSIZE directive. STACKSIZE overrides
the size specified on the link line.

For 16-bit linkers, the default stack size is 2K. If an odd value is specified
for the stack size, the linker will round it up to the next even value. For
32-bit linkers, the default stack size is 1MB. The linker rounds up the
specified value to the nearest 4 bytes.
