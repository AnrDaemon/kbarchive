The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0b, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you create a custom form and the Auto Tab option is set in a field, the
RETURN key has no effect on that field once the form is installed in Mail. This
limitation is necessary for fields such as the Subject, which are only one-line
text fields.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the RETURN key does not advance to a new line in a scrollable field, do the
following:

1. Open the form in the Forms Designer.

2. Select the field tool and double-click on the field in question.

3. Make sure that the Auto Tab option is not selected.

4. Compile and reinstall the form.
