SUMMARY
=======

In Flight Simulator Version 4.00, selecting operating mode "B: Normal flight
using system date and time" through the start-up menu will default back to
normal flight mode the first time the plane crashes, or the PRINT SCREEN key is
pressed to reset the flight.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
