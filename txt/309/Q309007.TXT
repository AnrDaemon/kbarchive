SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes the process of creating an FTP Site in the
Internet Information Manager Snap-in that is running on a Windows 2000-based
server. A member of the administrators group performs all of the procedures.

Create an FTP Site
------------------

The following procedures start in the Internet Information Manager snap-in.

NOTE: In order for these steps to work, FTP must be installed on your system.

To start the snap-in and create ftp site:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click
   Internet Information Manager.

2. In the Internet Information Services snap-in, right click your server object,
   point to New, and then click FTP Site.

3. When the FTP Site Creation Wizard starts, click Next.

4. On the FTP Site Description page, type your FTP site description in the
   Description box, and then click Next.

5. On the IP Address and Port Settings page, select the IP address that you are
   using, type the TCP port you are using (if it is different than the default),
   and then click Next.

6. On the FTP Site Home Directory page, type the path to your home directory in
   the Path box, and then click Next.

7. On the FTP Site Access Permissions page, check the desired Read and/or Write
   permissions, and then click Next.

8. Click Finish, and then verify the creation of your FTP Site in the console
   tree.

Troubleshooting
---------------

 - If the newly-created FTP Site does not appear in the console tree, click
   Refresh on the Action menu.
