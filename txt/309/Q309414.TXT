TITLE   :SNACFG Fails to Create Host Security Domain If HS Groups Exist
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::4.0 SP3,4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport kbsna400sp3 kbhis2000 kbhis2000bug kbsna400sp4

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SNACFG.exe, the SNA Command Line Configuration Utility, will return the
following error when it attempts to create a host security domain (HSD) if the
Windows NT/Windows 2000 domain local groups that it attempts to create already
exist:

   Processing command to add HSDOMAIN <HS Domain Name>

   Unable to process request. Possible network error

   Command failed


WORKAROUND
==========

If you manually delete the domain local groups that SNACFG.exe is attempting to
create, this will allow the HSD to be successfully added.

On Host Integration Server 2000, you also have the option of using the Host
Security Domain Configuration Wizard available within SNA Manager to create the
HSD. If the domain local groups already exist, the Wizard will return the
following message:

   The NT Local Group <HSD Name> already exists. Do you want to add a new
   Host Security Domain for it?

The Wizard will create the HSD if you click the Yes button in this message dialog
box.

The HSD Configuration Wizard in SNA Server 4.0 does not provide an option to
allow the creation of the HSD if the domain local groups already exist.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server 4.0 Service
Pack (SP) 3 and SP4, and Host Integration Server 2000.


MORE INFORMATION
================

When a host security domain is created, a Windows NT/Windows 2000 local domain
group must be created with the same name. A second group is also created which
appends "_proxy" to the HSD name for its group name. For example, when you
create an HSD called HSDTEST, the following Windows NT/2000 local domain groups
will be created:

 - HSDTEST

 - HSDTEST_Proxy

The ability to create host security domains by using SNACFG.exe was added to SNA
Server 4.0 in SP3. The following Microsoft Knowledge Base article explains the
functionality that was added:
