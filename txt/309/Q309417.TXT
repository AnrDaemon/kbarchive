TITLE   :You Can Start Only from 30 to 60 Simultaneous RSH Commands
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to a Services for UNIX (SFU) 2.0 RSH server, commands may not
run after from 30 to 60 simultaneous commands have started. However, the event
log lists "success" entries for the commands that do not run. The number of
commands that you can start simultaneously depends on your server's system
configuration, but is not limited by the system resources.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the memory that is available to Rshsvc is limited.
