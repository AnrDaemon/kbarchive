Vengeance Patching Utility" dialog box becomes visible. Look in this dialog box
to determine which file is responsible for the error message.

   corrupted file in the "Mech Warrior 4 Vengeance Patching Utility" dialog box.

2. In Windows Explorer, browse to the MechWarrior Vengeance folder, and then
   delete the corrupted file.

   NOTE: This file may be in the Resource folder.

3. Insert the MechWarrior 4 CD1 into your computer's CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive
   while you hold down the SHIFT key to prevent the autorun program from
   starting.

4. Copy the file from the CD-ROM to the folder on your computer's hard disk from
   which the corrupted file was deleted.

5. Start the PatchApply.exe program to install the update.
