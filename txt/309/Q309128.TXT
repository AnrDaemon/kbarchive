PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MechWarrior 4: Vengeance 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to a multiplayer game of Microsoft MechWarrior 4,
you may receive an error message that states "Unable to Connect" or "Server
Connection Failed."

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when you connect to the MechWarrior 4 server through a
proxy server or firewall.

RESOLUTION
==========

Firewall users must open up ports to use ZoneMatch and DirectX 8 DirectPlay port
ranges to successfully participate in games. Matchmaking needs the following TCP
ports opened:

   
   27999
   28805
   28806
   28807
   28808

   For PINGs to work properly, UDP port 28800 must be open.

NOTE: To have statistics posted to stats.zone.com from behind a firewall, you
must have TCP port 9999 open for outgoing connections.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to the ports listed earlier in this article, the DirectX8 DirectPlay
ports are outlined in the following article:
