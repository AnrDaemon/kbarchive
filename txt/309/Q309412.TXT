TITLE   :Services for UNIX 2.0 Redirector Not Working After Upgrade to XP
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv w2000sfu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, version 2.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Windows XP Professional 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you upgrade to Windows XP, the Windows Services for Unix 2.0 redirector may
not work and you may receive a message that indicates that the Windows Services
for UNIX client redirector is disabled because of problems.

CAUSE
=====

When Windows Services for Unix 2.0 was released, it was supported on both
Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000-based computers. This problem occurs because
changes that are made in Windows XP require strict driver checking which causes
problems in the Windows Services for UNIX redirector.
