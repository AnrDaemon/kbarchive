TITLE   :Single Sign-On Option Available with OLE DB Over TCP/IP
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport kbhis2000 kbhis2000bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you have an OLE DB Provider for DB2 Universal Data Link (UDL) configured to
use a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) connection, this
allows the Single Sign-On (SSO) option to be selected, even though this feature
is not supported for use with the OLE DB Provider when using direct TCP/IP
connections.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000.


MORE INFORMATION
================

When you initially configure when a new UDL to use a TCP/IP connection, SSO is
disabled. When the UDL is subsequently opened to check or change its settings,
SSO will be displayed as an available option.

SSO requires that you configure UDL for an Advanced Program-to-Program
Communications (APPC) connection in order to take advantage of SSO provided by
the Host Security Integration components. This is included with Host Integration
Server (HIS) 2000, as well as earlier versions of Microsoft SNA Server.

features, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft

The ODBC Driver for DB2 that is included with HIS 2000 displays the following
message when you select the "Use Single Sign-On" option while you are creating
or modifying an ODBC Data Source Name (DSN):

   Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2 Configuration

   Single Sign-On cannot be used with a TCP/IP connection. Please select an APPC
   connection on the Connection tab or specify a username on the Security tab.
