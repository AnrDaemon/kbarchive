TITLE   :Query Returns Empty Results with IS NULL Test Condition
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCOMIS kbWin2000sp3fix

======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

If a query contains a test condition with an IS NULL predicate for a particular
property, the query may not return any results.

CAUSE
=====

The query optimizer builds a range of empty to empty for IS NULL predicates. The
restriction is sent to the engine, which returns a null cursor, and the query
fails.
