TITLE   :CONVERT Verb Fails With SV_G on HIS 2000 End-User Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) application that is using
the Host Integration Server 2000 (HIS 2000) End-User Client may receive the
following error message:

   Primary Return Code: 0001 (SV_PARAMETER_CHECK)
   Secondary Return Code: 00000405 (SV_TABLE_ERROR)

This error typically occurs when the application is calling the Convert verb and
using a SV_G char_set parameter.

CAUSE
=====

The HIS 2000 End-User Client system does not contain a COMTBLG value in the
following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SnaBase\Parameters\Client

This value should exist and should contain the path for the default type G
conversion table.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000.
