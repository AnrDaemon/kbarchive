SYMPTOMS

When you attempt to view COM Transaction Integrator (COMTI) Performance Monitor

counters show a value of 0. COMTI Performance Monitor counters are seen when
they are accessed by all other means, such as remotely or by using the console.

RESOLUTION

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to

testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 service pack that contains
this fix.
