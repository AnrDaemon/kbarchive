======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Mifwin.exe tool after you install the Microsoft BackOffice
Resource Kit version 4.5, you may receive the following error message:

   There are no forms available

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Copy the following files from the BackOffice Resource Kit 4.5 to the
   Windows\Ms\SMS\Noidmifs folder:

    - Mifwin.exe
    - _mif.dll
    - Uinfo.xnf

   You can do this by creating a package from an SMS Installer script that
   contains the files (or a variety of other ways), and then creating an
   advertisement that targets the clients. The initial advertisement can also
   run the Mifwin.exe tool to bring up the form for the user to fill out.

   NOTE: The SMS version 1.2 files of the same name will not work with SMS
   version 2.0.

2. Create an advertisement to run the Windows\Ms\SMS\Noidmifs\Mifwin.exe program
   on the client whenever an update to the user information is needed.

   A Uinfo.mif file will be created or updated whenever the form is saved, and a
   User Information section will be created under the Hardware section of the
   Resource Explorer for the computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
