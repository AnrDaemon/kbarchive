======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSN versions 6.0, 6.1 
 - Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you install MSN Explorer, the Loadqm.exe file is added to the Startup
folder, and Loadqm.exe then starts each time you start your computer. Loadqm.exe
loads the MSN Queue Manager component which manages queuing for the background
file-transfer mechanism that is known as the drizzling service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The drizzle component runs as the Loadqm.exe launcher, and because of this,
global drizzles can only be run in the current user context. This feature is
required to enable WU AutoUpdate.

The Drizzling service is the preferred way to transfer data to the client for
background tasks and system services by preserving the end user experience by
not affecting available bandwidth. Requests to the Drizzle service are submitted
and the files can be transferred in a throttled manner so that the interactive
user is not affected by the bandwidth that is consumed.

How to Disable the AutoUpdate Feature
-------------------------------------

To disable AutoUpdate:

1. If you can already view protected operating system files, skip to step 2. If
   you cannot already view protected operating system files:

   a. Double-click My Computer, and then click Folder Options on the Tools menu.

   b. Click the View tab.

   c. In the Advanced Settings box, click Show hidden files and folders, and
      then click to clear the Hide File Extensions for Known File Types and Hide
      Protected Operating System Files check boxes.

   d. Click OK.

2. In My Computer, double-click drive C, double-click the Program Files folder,
   double-click the MSN folder, and then double-click the MSNCoreFiles folder.

3. Right-click the Msn6.ini file, and then click Open to open the file in
   Notepad. In the [msn6] section of the file there should be a line that starts
   with AutoUpdate=(some URL). Change this to "AutoUpdate=0" (without the
   quotation marks). On the File menu, click Save, and then quit Notepad.

4. Restart your computer.

NOTE: To turn the AutoUpdate feature back on, change the AutoUpdate=0 entry to
AutoUpdate=1.
