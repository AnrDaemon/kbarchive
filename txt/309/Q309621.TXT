   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Index Server cannot query documents over 256 kilobytes (KB) in size
that have unknown file name extensions.

CAUSE
=====

The default limit for files with unknown file name extensions is 256 KB. This
limit is set to prevent indexing of very large files.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
To work around this problem, follow these steps:

1. Start the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. In the following registry key, set MaxFileSizeFiltered to a value larger than
   256 KB in units of 1024 bytes:

     hklm\system\currentcontrolset\control\contentindex\MaxFileSizeFiltered

3. Close Registry Editor.

4. Restart the Content Index Service.

5. Rebuild the catalog.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
