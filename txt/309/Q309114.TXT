TITLE   :OLE DB Provider for DB2 Using SSO Fails With SQL State Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
 - Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following scenario assumes that Host Security is configured with a working
Host Account Cache (HAC):

If a Universal Data Link (.udl) file was configured to an AS/400 through Advanced
Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) with Single Sign-On (SSO) selected,
Test Connection will succeed. However, any application that uses this .udl file,
including the sample applications Drda_vb.exe and Rowsetviewer.exe, will fail
and report following error:

   Invalid User ID or password. SQLSTATE:08S01, SQLCODE:-568

CAUSE
=====

The user ID and password on the .udl file are always being used even if the
Single Sign-on checkbox was selected.

WORKAROUND
==========

Set both the UserId and Password fields to "MS$SAME" (without the quotation
marks) prior to selecting Single Sign-on .

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Host Integration Server 2000.
