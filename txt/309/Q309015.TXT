TITLE   :ODBC Provider for DB2 Doesn't Allow "Blank" Local APPC LU Alias
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2 Configuration dialog box does not allow a
blank Local APPC LU alias to be specified when you are creating a data source
name (DSN).

CAUSE
=====

The ODBC Provider for DB2 handles the Local APPC LU alias parameter as a
required field and does not allow the field to be left blank. The ODBC DSN
configuration interface requires that a Local APPC LU alias be selected from the
dropdown list or that the field be manually filled in.

WORKAROUND
==========

Although the ODBC DSN interface does not allow the Local APPC LU alias field to
be left blank, you can instead enter 8 spaces in the field. This gives the same
effect as using a blank Local APPC LU alias and bypasses the graphical user
interface restriction that requires that the field be nonblank.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The use of a blank Local APPC LU alias is desired to provide optimum Advanced
Program-to-Program (APPC) load balancing when you are using Host Integration
Server (HIS) 2000 or SNA Server.

For APPC load balancing in HIS 2000, an invoking APPC application must specify a
blank Local LU Alias in its TP_STARTED request. Once that request is received by
the HIS 2000 server, there are two methods the server tries to assign a local LU
to the application:

1. User or group APPC default LUs are used.

2. One or more local LUs are designated as members of the default outgoing local
   APPC LU pool.

If both of these attempts fail, the SNA server rejects the request.
