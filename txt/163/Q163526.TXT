SUMMARY
=======

Computer Associates Polycenter/AssetWORKS (formerly DEC Polycenter/AssetWORKS)
is an extension product installed on top of Microsoft Systems Management
Server.

For technical support issues, contact:

 - Microsoft Technical Support if the issue involves the basic fuctionality of
   Microsoft Systems Management Server (for example, if you are having
   difficulty installing the Systems Management Server client software on a
   client computer running Windows 95).

 - Computer Associates or other third-party technical support if the issue
   involves the AssetWORKS extended functionality (for example, if you are
   having difficulty managing UNIX resources).

For a period of time, Digital did market a Systems Management Server 1.0 and
AssetWORKS 1.x as a "bundle" (a two-disc compact disc set).
