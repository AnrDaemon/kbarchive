-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores the Human Body for Windows, version 1.0 
 - Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores Inside the Earth for Windows, version 1.0 
 - Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores in the Age of Dinosaurs for Windows, version 1.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start one of the Magic School Bus products listed above, you may
receive the following error message:

   Wave Error X: All wave devices that can play files in the current format are
   in use. Wait until a wave device is free, and then try again.

where X refers to a number, most commonly 7 or 10.

CAUSE
=====

You have Microsoft SoundBits (or a similar sound-producing program) installed
and enabled on your computer, or there is a .dll or .drv file other than
Mmsystem.dll on the drivers= line in the System.ini file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do one of the following:

 - Remark out the existing drivers= line located in the [boot] section of the
   System.ini. Do this by placing a semi-colon (;) at the beginning of the
   drivers= line, then add the following on a new line:

   drivers=mmsystem.dll

   For more information about how to perform this task in Windows, see your
   Windows printed documentation or online Help.

 - Disable or remove SoundBits.

For more information about disabling SoundBits, please see the following
article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q100399 How to Disable SoundBits

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Microsoft SoundBits (or a similar sound-producing program) is installed and
enabled, you will either not hear any startup audio with the Magic School Bus
program, or an error message may appear when you launch the program. This occurs
because both SoundBits and the Magic School Bus are trying to play audio at the
same time.
