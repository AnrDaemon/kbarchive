SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install Microsoft Beyond the Limit: Ultimate Climb or Encarta
Virtual Globe 99, you may receive one of the following error messages:

   Unable to copy a file to the computer.

   - or -

   d:\setup
   Cannot find the file 'd:\setup' (or one of its components). Make
   sure that path and filename are correct and that all required
   libraries are available.

   - or -

   Program Not Found
   Cannot find file 'D:\SETUP.EXE'.

   - or -

   Browse
   D:\Setup.exe
   This file cannot be found.
   Make sure that the correct path and filename are given.

Also, if you are using real-mode CD-ROM drivers and you view the contents of the
compact disc in Explorer, you will see the following folders:

   Ap~00001
   Sp~00002

These folders should be seen as:

   App
   Support

CAUSE
=====

The symptoms described above may occur if your computer is using real-mode
CD-ROM drivers to access the compact disc.

When Setup attempts to copy files from a folder that uses both upper and
lowercase letters, setup fails. This happens because only protected mode CD-ROM
drivers support this type of file name. Real-mode CD-ROM drivers support only
filenames with all uppercase letters.

Therefore, if the Setup program is looking for Setup.exe, the only file the
CD-ROM driver reports is SETUP.EXE. Since this is not an exact match, the Setup
program reports that the file does not exist on the compact disc.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, obtain the most recent version of protected mode CD-ROM
drivers available for your CD-ROM drive from your hardware manufacturer.

If you are having difficulty accessing your CD-ROM drive from a Command prompt,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
