document.

When the computer begins to respond, you may see the following error message:

   The action cannot be completed because unknown is busy. (switch to, retry,
   cancel).

Clicking Cancel causes the computer to stop responding again, and the following
error message is displayed:

Finally, at this point, you are returned to the document.

Attempting to edit the equation again may result in the following error message:
