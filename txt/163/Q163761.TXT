TITLE   :ASP Page Not Update Even if File Included in it Has Been Changed
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:3.0; :1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 3.0 
 - Microsoft Active Server Pages, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Active Server Page (ASP) page will not update even if the file
included in it has been changed. No problem exists if the file included in the
ASP file is in the same virtual root as the ASP file.

WORKAROUND
==========

Put the included files in the same virtual root as the ASP file. Included files
and the ASP file can be in different subdirectories as long as they share the
same virtual root.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Server version 3.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
