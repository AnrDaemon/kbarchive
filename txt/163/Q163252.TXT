======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Resource Editor, included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 4.0, 4.1 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 4.2 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Once you set the push-like (BS_PUSHLIKE) style for a radio button or check box
and close the dialog editor window, you cannot remove the push-like style from
the resource file.

You can deselect this style in the button's properties, but this change does not
hold and the push-like style remains set.

RESOLUTION
==========

The only way to remove the BS_PUSHLIKE style once it has been set is by editing
the .RC file in a text editor.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++,
version 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Here is an example of a dialog resource with both a radio button and a check box
with BS_PUSHLIKE:

   IDD_DIALOG1 DIALOG DISCARDABLE  0, 0, 183, 92
   STYLE DS_MODALFRAME | WS_POPUP | WS_CAPTION | WS_SYSMENU
   CAPTION "Dialog"
   FONT 8, "MS Sans Serif"
   BEGIN
       DEFPUSHBUTTON   "OK",IDOK,126,7,50,14
       PUSHBUTTON      "Cancel",IDCANCEL,126,24,50,14
       CONTROL         "Radio1",IDC_RADIO1,"Button",BS_AUTORADIOBUTTON |
                       BS_PUSHLIKE,18,22,39,10
       CONTROL         "Check1",IDC_CHECK1,"Button",BS_AUTOCHECKBOX |
                       BS_PUSHLIKE | WS_TABSTOP,19,49,41,10
   END

Here's the same dialog with the BS_PUSHLIKE style removed:

   IDD_DIALOG1 DIALOG DISCARDABLE  0, 0, 183, 92
   STYLE DS_MODALFRAME | WS_POPUP | WS_CAPTION | WS_SYSMENU
   CAPTION "Dialog"
   FONT 8, "MS Sans Serif"
   BEGIN
       DEFPUSHBUTTON   "OK",IDOK,126,7,50,14
       PUSHBUTTON      "Cancel",IDCANCEL,126,24,50,14
       CONTROL         "Radio1",IDC_RADIO1,"Button",BS_AUTORADIOBUTTON,
                       18,22,39,10
       CONTROL         "Check1",IDC_CHECK1,"Button",BS_AUTOCHECKBOX |
                       WS_TABSTOP,19,49,41,10
   END
