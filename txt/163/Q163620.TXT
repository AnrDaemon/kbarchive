KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Windows NT to access a file with an extremely long file name that
is nested in a long path, the following blue screen STOP error message may
occur:

   STOP 0x00000050 (0xff737000 0x00000001 0x00000001 0x00000000)

Note: The first parameter will vary, but the last three should always be the
same.

CAUSE
=====

The Redirector (Rdr.sys) does not check the path name before sending a
Query_Information server message block (SMB).


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use one of the following methods:

 - Reduce the length of the path and/or the length of the filename of the file
   being accessed on the server.

 - Apply the Windows NT service pack mentioned in this article.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem is corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
