TITLE   :PRB: Warning Message in MS Access After Installing ODE Tools
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Access 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following warning message when you open Microsoft Access 97
after installing the Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools (ODE Tools):

   You don't have a source code control program (such as Microsoft Visual
   SourceSafe) installed on your machine. The source code control commands are
   therefore not available.

   Do you want to see this warning again?

CAUSE
=====

You receive the warning message if you install the Microsoft Access Source Code
Control component of ODE Tools, but you do not have source code control
software, such as Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, installed. This warning also
appears if you have Microsoft Visual SourceSafe installed on your computer, but
you only installed the server component and not the client component.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you do not intend to use source code control software, you can disable the
warning message by clicking No at the "Do you want to see this warning again?"
prompt.

If you plan to install Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, be sure to install the Client
Program (Intel 32-bit) component (in Microsoft Visual SourceSafe version 5.0),
or the Network Client Setup component (in Microsoft Visual SourceSafe version
4.0) on your computer. If you do not install the client component, the warning
message still appears in Microsoft Access.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Access Source Code Control component of ODE Tools installs the
following files on your computer:

File Name      Description
--------------------------

Accscc.dll Source code control add-in Addsccus.dll Localization file for source
code control add-in Sccaccus.hlp Source code control Help file Sccaccus.cnt
Source code control Help file component Sccaccus.fts Source code control Help
file component Sccaccus.gid Source code control Help file component Sccaccus.ftg

recover approximately 1 megabyte (MB) of hard disk space by removing this ODE
Tools component from your computer.
