The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1

SYMPTOMS
========

A connection using a Channel adapter, although configured for a format 0 XID,
generates an XID indicating format 3.

CAUSE
=====

The first byte of the XID generated specifies format 3.

RESOLUTION

Apply the update referenced below. An update to the SNA Server Administrator
program corrects the format of the connection entry to properly indicate Format
0 for channel connections.

and 2.11 Service Pack 1 (SP1).


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
