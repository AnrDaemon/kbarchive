TITLE   :XADM: Invalid Message Embedded in Internet Message Causes NDR
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You receive a nondelivery report (NDR) message if all of the following
conditions are true:

 - A precomposed message with an invalid SMTP recipient is saved in the inbox.

 - This invalid message is embedded in a message with a valid SMTP recipient.

 - The valid message is sent through Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 Internet Mail
   Connector (IMC).

CAUSE
=====

During the MIME content conversion, the address of embedded message is
processed; thus, an NDR is generated.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, check the name of the embedded message.

STATUS
======
