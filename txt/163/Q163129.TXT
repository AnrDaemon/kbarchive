TITLE   :RAS Client Fails to Connect to Service Pack 2 Using NetBEUI
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP2 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Remote Access Service (RAS) client attempts to dial into a Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 2 RAS server and the RAS server has NetBEUI configured to access
This Computer Only, the NetBEUI connection is never established.

The RAS client receives an error 718 stating that the connection was not
established. For example, a Windows 95 RAS client usually receives the following
error message:

   Dial up Networking could not negotiate a compatible set of protocols you
   specified in the Server Type Settings. Check your network configuration in
   the Control Panel then try the connection again.

A Windows NT Server machine acting as a RAS client usually receives the following
error message:

   NetBEUI CP reported error 718. Timed out waiting for a valid response from
   the PPP peer.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a change in RAS in Windows NT Service Pack 2.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
