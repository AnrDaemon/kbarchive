TITLE   :XCLN: Fax Recipients' Information does not Appear on Cover Sheet
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a FAX from within a Microsoft Exchange client, the Fax recipients'
information (Recipient's Address/City/State/Zip/County/ Title/Department/Office
location/Home telephone/Office telephone) do not appear on the cover sheet.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange profile in use has both the Microsoft Exchange Server
service and the FAX Service, and the mail delivery is set to mailbox (server
store) instead of a local personal folder (PST).

RESOLUTION
==========

You can either:

1. Add a PST to the existing profile and set delivery to that PST.

   -or-

2. If you want mail to reside on the Microsoft Exchange Server and not a local
   PST, create 2 profiles, one for FAX and one for Microsoft Exchange. Leave
   delivery in the Microsoft Exchange profile set to mailbox and in the FAX
   profile, set delivery to a PST.
