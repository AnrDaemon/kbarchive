TITLE   :Delay While Establishing SPX II Connection
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

While establishing an SPX II connection, you may experience approximately a five
second delay during the SPX session setup.

CAUSE
=====

When establishing a SPX II session, you follow these steps.

 - Client - SPX II Connection Request

 - Host - Extended SPX II ACK

 - Client - Negotiate Size Request

 - Host - Extended SPX II ACK (Negotiate Size ACK)

 - Host - Session Setup/Negotiate Size

 - Client - Extended SPX II ACK (Negotiate Size ACK)

When Windows NT sends the last Client ACK, it does not require an ACK to be
returned (does not turn on the acknowledge bit). The server, in these cases, is
waiting for a packet that requires an ACK to start transmission. Apparently,
during the session setup phase of SPX II, it is OK to require that all packets
have the ACK bit set. Because the client did not require an ACK on the last
packet of the negotiation, the Novell server does not start sending data, as we
would normally expect it to. Instead, we timeout the NWLNKSPX Parameter for
KeepAliveTimeout (which defaults to 12), which is a measurement in half seconds.
This is the delay before a packet that requires an ACK is sent, and this starts
the server going again.
