PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Kids Products

KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores in the Age of Dinosaurs for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you play the Name Game in The Magic School Bus Explores in the Age of
Dinosaurs, the Close Captioning may not match the placement of the syllable
crystals.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can play the Name Game by clicking the Game Selector on the left hand side
of the back of the bus. The Game Selector cycles through all of the available
games.

The object of the Name Game is to arrange the syllable crystals in the correct
order to pronounce the name of the dinosaur. When you have placed the crystals,
you can click on the mouth to have the syllables read aloud. Close Captioning
will always show the correct name of the dinosaur, not the mixed-syllable
attempts.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in The Magic School Bus Explores in
the Age of Dinosaurs for Windows, version 1.0. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
