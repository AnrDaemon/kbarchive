-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Server Internet Mail Connector (IMC) and Internet Mail
Service (IMS) will perform character set translation on an embedded message
within a UUEncoded non-TNEF message as specified for the recipient domain. This
is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The IMC and IMS converts the embedded message because Transport Neutral Encoding
Format (TNEF) is not specified. To ensure the message becomes encapsulated and
is not translated, use TNEF encoding to send the embedded message.
