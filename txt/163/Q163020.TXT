   From: MICROSOFT/NETPO/USER
   Subject: Message from User

   [008] Failure delivering user mail due to mailbag contention.
   Mail item was not delivered to:

CAUSE
=====

This condition usually means that the .mbg (mailbag) file on the Exchange
Connector postoffice is over the 4096 record limit.

There is a 4096 record limit built into the .mbg file in Microsoft Mail and also
on the Exchange Connector postoffice.

The Microsoft Exchange PC-MTA service may stop and the Microsoft Mail Connector
Interchange service (MSMI) continues to move mail to the .mbg file for the
downstream Microsoft Mail postoffice. Once this reaches 4096 messages, the MSMI
returns an NDR for all new messages.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

 - Check to make sure the PC-MTA service is running on the Exchange Server
   computer.
