TITLE   :SMS: PCM Service Leaves Drive Letters Connected
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPCM smspcmkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Some Run Command on Workstation packages may leave drive letters mapped after a
package has completed running when the packages are run through the Package
Command Manager (PCM) service (Pcmsvc32.exe) on client computers running Windows
NT Workstation.

CAUSE
=====

This is a result of files being left open on the package share after the
application has completed running. PCM detects that the application has
terminated, and tries to disconnect the drive to the package share. However,
because the package has left one or more files open, PCM is unable to disconnect
the drive that it connected.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.


A supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-tested and should
be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are
severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical
Support for more information.
