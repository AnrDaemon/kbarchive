PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbAPI kbSDKPlatform kbWinsock kbGrpDSNetkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Winsock applications running on the specified version of Windows NT Server or
Workstation may fail with timeout errors, report incomplete data received, or
report some other error. The failures seen include errors indicating that the
remote system is no longer available or that incorrect results have been
received from the remote system. This problem has been seen with socket
applications running on Macintosh client systems connecting to Windows NT Server
using the AppleTalk protocol.

CAUSE
=====

When a Winsock application calls one of the Winsock send APIs (Send, WSASend,
and so on), one of the parameters passed to the API is the amount of data to be
sent. If for any reason the Winsock driver, Afd.sys, could not send the total
amount on a nonblocking socket in a single data packet, Afd.sys would
incorrectly report the total bytes sent to the application. There may be other
symptoms because an incorrect response will have an undetermined effect on the
application.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0 with
Service Pack 2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT
4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
