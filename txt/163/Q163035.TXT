TITLE   :FIX: Printer Fonts Won't Stay Selected in VFP Report Designer
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbvfp kbvfp500bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When changing the font for a report expression in the Report Designer, any of
the fonts that show up in the Font properties box that have a printer icon in
front of them do not stay selected after closing the font box.

These so-called "printer fonts" stay selected while the Font properties box is
open. Once the Font properties box is closed, they are deselected and the report
expression does not print in that chosen font. Reopening the Font properties box
shows that there is no font currently selected. If any other font is selected,
it stays selected when the font box is reopened.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This has been corrected in Visual FoxPro version
6.0.
