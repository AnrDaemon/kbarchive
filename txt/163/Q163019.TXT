TITLE   :RUI Library Terminates RUI Session When PIU Has Not Been Sent
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11 SP1,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11 SP1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain conditions, an LUA session may terminate unexpectedly with the
following error message:

   Event ID: 1954
   Source: SNA RUI Application
   Description: RUI internal logic error for LU <name>, code <value>

CAUSE
=====

When the SNA Server service informs the RUI library that a Path Information Unit
(PIU) has not been sent due to some problem (such as a bracket error), the RUI
library terminates the RUI session. RUI internal logical error 1954 is logged in
the application Event Log.

RESOLUTION
==========

A fix is available to correct this problem.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server versions
2.11 Service Pack 1 and 3.0. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
for Windows NT 2.11 and 3.0 U.S. Service Packs For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base

MORE INFORMATION
================

The RUI library posts RUI_WRITE as complete once it has passed the data to the
SNA Server service, instead of waiting for the SNA Server service to actually
process the data. In this situation, it is possible that the PIU has not yet
been sent. For example, this may be the case due to a race condition with the
host application. When the SNA Server service informs the RUI library that the
PIU has not been sent, the RUI library terminates the RUI session because it was
already informed that the RUI_WRITE was completed successfully.
