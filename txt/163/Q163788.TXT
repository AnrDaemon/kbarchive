The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0

SUMMARY
=======

Now that Personal Web Server supports ISAPI, the FoxISAPI sample can run on the
Personal Web Server that comes with FrontPage 97 or FrontPage 98.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The FoxISAPI sample is supported only with Internet Information Server (IIS) on
Windows NT 3.51, but will also work with Windows NT 4.0 and FrontPage 97 or
FrontPage 98. It is strongly recommended that you download the updated version
of the FoxISAPI sample in order to work with FrontPage 97 or FrontPage 98 and
Windows NT 4.0.

You can currently download the updated version of the FoxISAPI sample from:

   http://www.microsoft.com/vfoxpro owner's area

Please follow the instructions and download the Foxisapi.exe file (Other Samples
and Tools).

Follow the steps stated in the first Knowledge Base article listed in the
REFERENCES section below to set up FoxISAPI for IIS. For FoxISAPI to work with
FrontPage 97 or FrontPage 98, follow the same steps, but install the files to
the C:\WEBSHARE\SCRIPTS directory instead of the C:\Inetsrv\Scripts directory
for Internet Information Server (IIS).
