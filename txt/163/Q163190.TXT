PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows

KEYWORDS:kbualink97 kbdta word8 word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you review tracked changes in a document that is protected for tracked
changes, the Accept All and Reject All buttons are available in the Accept or
Reject Changes dialog box. However, neither button will accept or reject changes
in the document.

RESOLUTION
==========

To accept or reject tracked changes, you must unprotect the document by clicking
Unprotect Document on the Tools menu and typing a password (if the document was
protected using a password).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.  This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Word 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the document is protected for tracked changes, the Accept All and Reject
All buttons should be unavailable (dimmed), because accepting or rejecting
tracked changes is not allowed in a document that is protected for tracked
changes.

To find the Accept All and Reject All buttons, point to Track Changes on the
Tools menu and then click "Accept or Reject Changes".
