======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, Professional Edition, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Visual FoxPro executable program launched from the Windows Explorer or the
Macintosh Finder runs a form that contains code to execute the SaveAs method of
the form, the executable will not create the new form and no error message will
be displayed. If the executable is launched in the Visual FoxPro environment,
the SaveAs method works correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a project. Add a new form to the project.

2. Change the WindowType property of the form to 1-Modal.

3. On the form, add two Command Buttons. In the Click event of the first Command
   Button, add the following code:

        RELEASE Thisform

4. In the Click event of the second Command Button, enter this code:

        Thisform.SaveAs ('myform')

5. Save the form.

6. Build the project into an executable.

7. Run the executable in the development environment. Click the Command Button
   that has the SaveAs method in it. It will create a new form named Myform.SCX.

8. Run the same EXE from the Explorer. Click the button and note that Visual
   FoxPro acts busy for a brief moment, but does not create the form and does
   not display an error message.
