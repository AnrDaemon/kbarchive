The updated FoxTools.cfm and FoxTools.slm files in this archive should be placed
in the Visual FoxPro folder, replacing the earlier versions. It is not necessary
to restart the Macintosh or Visual FoxPro.

Because these files are not marked with a version number, the best way to tell
the old copies from the new copies is by size.

The size of the old FoxTools files is as follows:

    FoxTools.cfm         86,629 bytes
    FoxTools.slm         70,291 bytes

The size of the new FoxTools files is as follows:

    FoxTools.cfm         86,693 bytes
    FoxTools.slm         70,303 bytes

The incompatibilities addressed by the new FoxTools files normally show up as a
type 11 error right after you click the Finish button on the last step of the
Setup Wizard. Instead of a type 11 error, sometimes the error message is "ASLM
Switch -111."

These new FoxTools files should also help if you are getting type 11 errors when
using the FxGetResource() and FxSetResource() functions in FoxTools.

The Visual FoxPro for Macintosh Setup Wizard uses only the FoxTools.slm file even
though the development version of Visual FoxPro for Macintosh can only be run on
a PowerMacintosh. Therefore, it is necessary to at least replace the old
FoxTools.slm if you are having problems running the Setup Wizard on the
Macintosh.
