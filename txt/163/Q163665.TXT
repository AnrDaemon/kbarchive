======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft  version of this article, see Q194222.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft FrontPage on a computer that is running a shared
network installation of Microsoft Office 7.0, Microsoft Excel 7.0, Microsoft
Word 7.0, or Microsoft PowerPoint 7.0, you may receive one of the following
error messages:

   Severe: General File Transfer Error -3.
   Please check your target location and try again.


-or-

   General file transfer error. Please check your target location and try
   again.

   Error Number: -3


CAUSE
=====

You do not have write privileges to the network share that contains the Office
95 shared components. Microsoft FrontPage shares text converters and proofing
tools with Microsoft Office applications. During installation, FrontPage setup
attempts to upgrade some of these shared components. If the Setup program cannot
upgrade these components, you will receive the first error message described in
the "Symptoms" section.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use one of the following methods to install FrontPage 97.

Case 1: If You Do not Have Write Privileges to the Network Share
----------------------------------------------------------------

From any workstation that uses the shared components on the network server, grant
write permissions to the network server, and then run FrontPage Setup one time.
After the Setup program has completed and the shared components are upgraded,
you can run subsequent installations without setting write permissions to the
shared network server.

NOTE: This error does not occur with shared installations of Office 97 because
the shared components in Office 97 do not need to be upgraded by FrontPage
Setup.

Case 2: If FrontPage Is Installed in the Root Directory
-------------------------------------------------------

1. On the Windows Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.

3. Uninstall FrontPage. From the list of installed programs, select Microsoft
   FrontPage and click Add/Remove.

4. Start the FrontPage 97 Setup program.

5. Select a destination directory other than the root directory. To do this,
   click Browse when you are prompted to select the Destination Directory.
   Select the C:\Program Files\Microsoft FrontPage directory, for example. If
   you receive a message asking you if you want to create this directory, click
   Yes.

6. Follow the instructions on your screen.
