TITLE   :TN3270E Sets Incorrect Sequence Number on ACKLUA Messages
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbusagekbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you type commands too quickly on a TN3270 emulator, for example without
waiting for the result of the previous command to display on the screen, the
TN3270 client session may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

In this circumstance, the TN3270 Server issues an RUI_READ before it has
finished processing the previous RUI_READ. This causes it to set incorrect
sequence numbers on messages which it sends to the host.

RESOLUTION
==========

An SNA Server update is available to correct this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 2.11 Service
Pack 1.


A supported 2.11 fix is now available, but has not been fully regression- tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless
you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that
you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
