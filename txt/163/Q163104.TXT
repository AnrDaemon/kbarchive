SYMPTOMS
========

When you run your custom Setup program to install your custom application, you
may receive the following error message:

   Object error 325

CAUSE
=====

The version number of your custom application was not updated when you added or
changed files using the ODE Setup wizard.

RESOLUTION
==========

Always change the version number for your custom application each time you
change the files included in the Setup program. This includes adding, deleting,
or modifying the files. The version number should be changed on the Provide
Application Details screen of the Setup Wizard in the "What is the version
number of your application?" box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ODE Setup Wizard program requires that you update the version number for
your application each time you update your disk images. If you do not do this
when you make changes to your custom Setup program, you may receive the "Object
error 325" error message.
