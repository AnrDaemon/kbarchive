======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual SourceSafe version 5.0 is an OLE automation server and can be called
programmatically from within Visual FoxPro. This article describes how to invoke
the OLE server and demonstrates some simple functionality.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Assuming that Visual SourceSafe Version 5.0 is installed, and that Tastrade.pjx
has been added to a SourceSafe database, the following code sample will check
out main.prg to the current Visual FoxPro default directory:

         oSSafe = CREATEOBJECT("SourceSafe")

         * Syntax is object.open(path to srcsafe.ini, username, password)
         oSSafe.open("C:\vss\srcsafe.ini","guest","")

         * The next 2 lines show some of the object's properties
         ? oSSafe.username
         ? oSSafe.currentproject

         * The next line assumes FoxApps is the Visual SourceSafe project and
         * Tastrade is a subproject
         oFile = oSSafe.vssitem("$/FoxApps/Tastrade/main.prg")
         oFile.Checkout()
         oFile.Checkin()

For more information on the Visual SourceSafe object model, you can use a tool
such as the Visual Basic object browser. Documentation is also available on the
