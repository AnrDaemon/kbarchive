MORE INFORMATION
================

SNA Server provides a single license of StarSQL (the ODBC driver included with
SNA Server) per copy of Microsoft SNA Server, and a limit of ten connections per
driver instance. SNA Server 2.11 and SNA Server 2.11 Service Pack 1 have the
same licensing provisions, but do not place any restrictions on the use of the
driver.

SNA Server 2.11 Service Pack 2 or SNA Server 3.0 will return the following error
if a user attempts to use more than one instance of the ODBC/DRDA driver per
server:

   [StarQuest][StarSQL ODBC Driver]No more licenses available.
   Contact StarQuest Software, Inc to acquire additional licenses.(#0)
