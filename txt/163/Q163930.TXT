KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual FoxPro for Windows, clicking on Cancel in a builder and then choosing
Undo from the Edit menu causes FoxPro to shut down. In Visual FoxPro for
Macintosh, the program reports a Type 11 error and shuts down.


The following error message appears in Windows 95 after choosing Undo:

   "This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down"

Clicking Details reveals the following message:

   "VFP caused an invalid page fault in module VFP.exe at <memory
   address>"

In Windows NT 4.0, the following error appears:

   "An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
   generated"

   "VFP.exe
   Exception: access violation <error number>, Address: <memory
   address>"

The operating system then closes Visual FoxPro.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem does not occur in Visual FoxPro 5.0 because the Undo menu pad is not
available in this instance.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: As may occur with any system error or abnormal shutdown of an
application on the Macintosh, some customers have reported that the following
steps have corrupted the hard drive on their machines. Therefore, you should not
attempt to reproduce these steps on the Macintosh.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form and add a text box object to the form.

2. Select the text box object, right-mouse click and choose Builder from the
   menu.
