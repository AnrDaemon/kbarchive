TITLE   :Sense Code 080E0000 Trying to Connect to an AS/400
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11,3.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Any attempt to connect to an AS/400 fails even when the appropriate device and
controllers exist. The Windows NT Server Event Viewer Application log records
the following event:

   Event 18
   APPC session activation failure:
   BIND negative response or UNBIND request received
   Sense data = 080E0000

The AS/400 will show a status on the line and the controller, but will not show a
corresponding device, even if it has been created manually. If the device has
not been created manually, the System Operator message queue on the AS/400 will
record errors related to the creation of the device.

CAUSE
=====

IBM implemented a directory search filter in OS/400 V3R2. This feature, if not
properly configured, will reject connection attempts and will return the
080E0000 sense code.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The command WRKCFGL (Work with Configuration Lists) will have entries for the
directory search filter. If a particular entry is set for *REJECT, it must be
changed to *ACCEPT to allow connections.

The following IBM AS/400 book describes this feature in detail:

   SC41-3300 Tips and Tools for securing the AS/400
