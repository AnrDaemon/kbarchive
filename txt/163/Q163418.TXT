PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbvfp kbvfp500aFIX kbvfp500bugkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a page in a pageframe is disabled (grayed out) in Visual FoxPro 5.0 and the
arrow keys are used to move from an active page to the disabled page, all items
in the disabled page will show through on the pageframe even though the page is
disabled. The ActivePage property will show that the page that was active before
trying to move to the disabled page is still the active page, but the objects
shown on the pageframe will be the contents of the disabled page. In Visual
FoxPro 3.0, the arrow keys could not be used to move through the pages of a
pageframe.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro
5.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form and add a pageframe to it. Change the PageCount to 3.

2. Add a label to each page of the pageframe and change the Caption of the label
   to the name of each page.

3. Select Page 2 of the pageframe and change the Enabled Property to False.

4. Run the form and move through the pages of the pageframe with the left or
   right arrow keys. Note that the label of page 2 shows through even though the
   page is disabled.
