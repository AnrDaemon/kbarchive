SUMMARY
=======

In some cases, you may need to statically initialize entries into the Windows
Internet Name Service (WINS) database.

Static WINS mappings are not recommended for WINS-aware clients, such as Windows
NT, Windows 95, and Windows for Workgroups 3.11.

However, in a new environment, you may import an LMHOSTS file to create static
mappings. To convert static mappings to dynamic, select "migrate on/off" on the
Advanced WINS Server Configuration screen. This option should be cleared when
all WINS aware clients have been brought up and their static WINS entries are
converted to dynamic.

Here is the procedure for importing an LMHOSTS file in WINS to add specific
static addresses:

1. Start WINS Manager.

2. Select the appropriate WINS server.

3. On the Mappings menu, click Static Mappings.

4. Click Import Mappings.

5. Select the LMHOSTS file you want to import.

NOTE: The Lmhosts file that you attempt to import must exist with a standard 8.3
filename format.
