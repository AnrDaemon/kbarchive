-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Client for Windows 95, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you shut down Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows NT without logging
off Microsoft Schedule+, the local Microsoft Schedule+ calendar is not
synchronized with the server-based calendar.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Windows 95 and Windows NT disconnect all user-
established network connections before Microsoft Schedule+ can synchronize the
local calendar with the server-based calendar.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, log off Microsoft Schedule+ before you shut down Windows.
To do this, click Exit And Log Off on the File menu in Microsoft Schedule+.
