TITLE   :FP97: SQL Query Missing, Deleted When Running IDC Wizard
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open an existing Internet Database Connector (IDC) file, the Structured
Query Language (SQL) query may not appear in the SQL Query box. If you click
Finish in the Internet Database Connector Wizard the existing query is erased.

CAUSE
=====

The IDC looks for a carriage return when it parses the SQL statement. If it
finds the end of the file before it finds a carriage return, the IDC omits the
SQL statement when it writes the file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not click Finish in the Internet Database Connector Wizard when the SQL Query
box is empty. Instead, click Cancel, open the IDC file in a text editor, and
insert a carriage return after the SQL statement.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs only with IDC files that contain a single-line SQL query,
which is not terminated by a carriage return. A multi-line query is not affected
even when the SQL statement is not terminated with a carriage return. For
example, the following statement will be deleted if there is no carriage return
after the word, "Employees":

   SQLStatement: DELETE DISTINCTROW FirstName FROM Employees

The following statement will not be deleted:

   SQLStatement: DELETE DISTINCTROW FirstName
      +FROM Employees
