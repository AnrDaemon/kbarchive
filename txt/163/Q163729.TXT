TITLE   :WD97: OLE Automation Fails When Using "Word.Basic" Object
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows

KEYWORDS:kbfile kbdta kbdtacode word8 kbwordvba word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a programming language that calls a Visual Basic for Applications
or WordBasic instruction using OLE Automation, and your calling application (for
example, Microsoft Visual Basic 3.0) cannot use named arguments, the OLE
automation fails.

CAUSE
=====

When you use a programming language that cannot call a Visual Basic for
Applications or WordBasic instruction using named arguments, you must identify
these arguments by position using commas as placeholders.

RESOLUTION
==========

To ensure the correct WordBasic command argument positioning when using OLE
Automation to interact with Visual Basic for Applications, use the Position.hlp
file for Word versions 6.x and 7.x.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

   Position.exe
   (http://download.microsoft.com/download/word60win/utility3/1/WIN98/EN-US/position.exe)

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual Basic for Applications includes a WordBasic Automation object
(Word.Basic) that includes methods for all the WordBasic statements and
functions available in Word versions 6.x, 7.x.

WordBasic statements or functions in Microsoft Word can take named arguments. If
your application does not support named arguments, and you send WordBasic
commands through OLE Automation, your application must specify all the
parameters to a WordBasic function in the proper order. The same call in
WordBasic may only require some of the parameters using named arguments, and
those parameters could be provided in any order.

For most WordBasic statements, the positioning of the arguments is documented in
the WordBasic Help topics or printed reference entries for those statements.
However, the arguments for some statements are not listed in proper order, or
the arguments are irrelevant or have no effect. These arguments are not
documented in WordBasic Help or in the printed reference.

For example, the InsertIndex statement corresponds to the Index tab in the Index
and Tables dialog box. The InsertIndex statement takes a number of arguments
that have to do with other tabs in the dialog box, such as the Table Of Contents
tab. Because these arguments are irrelevant to inserting an index, they are
ignored, and are therefore not documented in WordBasic Help or in the printed
reference. But, as an OLE Automation programmer, you need to be aware of these
arguments so you can correctly specify arguments by position.

NOTE: If your program was written to call WordBasic commands and you are
anticipating interacting with the Microsoft Word Visual Basic for Applications
language for all future development, it is recommended that you convert your
code from WordBasic to Visual Basic for Applications commands for Microsoft
Word.

For a listing of these statements and the correct order of the arguments, look to
the Position.txt text file. This file is included on the disk included with the
Word Developer's Kit (located in the Wrdbasic directory).
