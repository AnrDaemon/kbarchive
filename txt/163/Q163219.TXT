TITLE   :Spooler Uses 92%+ CPU When a Lexmark TCP/IP Printer Goes Offline
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When using a Lexmark TCP/IP network port to print to a printer that goes offline
(due to being out of paper, a paper jam, and so on), CPU usage will spike to
between 92-100 percent. The process that grabs the processor time is SPOOLSS.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this excessive amount of CPU usage, do either of the following:

 - Use Lexmark DLC ports or Microsoft TCP/IP printer ports (LPR) instead of
   Lexmark TCP/IP.

   -or-

 - Contact Lexmark's Support line at (606) 232-3000 for a new Lexbcelm.dll file
   that resolves this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
