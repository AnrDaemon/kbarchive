TITLE   :WD97: Temporary Parameter for Control Does Not Work
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta kbdtacode word8 kbwordvba word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Temporary parameter for the Visual Basic for Applications Control object
does not work as expected.

CAUSE
=====

The Temporary parameter is an optional argument associated with the Control
object. Setting this parameter to True should make the new control temporary.
Temporary controls are automatically deleted when the container application is
closed.

In Word, when this parameter is set to True, the control should be temporary;
however, Word ignores this parameter and the control becomes permanent.

For more information about the Temporary parameter, from the Visual Basic Editor,
click the Office Assistant, type "Add Method," click Search, and then click to
view "Add Method (CommandBars Collection)."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If the Assistant is not able to answer your query, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q176476 OFF: Office Assistant Not Answering Visual Basic Questions

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Temporary feature was intended for other applications that did not support
session-specific settings. Because Word can store information in global
templates or local templates, you can get all of the Temporary functionality
without using the Temporary flag.
