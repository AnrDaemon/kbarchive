TITLE   :ODE97: Autorun Screen Appears When Adding ODE Tools Components
PRODUCT :Microsoft Access Distribution Kit
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools (ODE) Setup program
to add a component, Setup prompts you to insert the CD-ROM. When you do, the
original Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition installation options screen is
displayed on your computer.

CAUSE
=====

The Setup program for ODE Tools does not disable the Autorun.exe program on the
CD-ROM. Autorun.exe invokes the installation options screen whenever you insert
the CD-ROM in your computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Close the Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition installation options screen and
proceed to add the ODE Tools components using the Setup program that is already
running.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Office 97 Developer
Edition Tools.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Insert the ODE Tools CD-ROM in your computer. Note that the installation
   options screen appears.

2. Click the "Install the Office Developer Edition Tools" button to start the
   ODE Tools Setup program.

3. Perform a Custom installation, and leave at least one ODE Tools component
