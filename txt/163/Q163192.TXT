SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to assign the value of a variable containing more than 255
characters to a FormField object, you will receive the following error:

   Run-time error '4609': "String too long"

CAUSE
=====

The following example macro causes the error described in the Symptoms section
of this article:

      Sub StringTooLongError()
         Dim sMyVar As String
         sMyVar = String(256, "x")
         ActiveDocument.FormFields(1).Result = sMyVar
      End Sub

The following example Visual Basic for Applications code sets text greater than
255 characters in length to the form field named Text1:

      Sub WorkAround255Limit()
         ' Set Text1 form field to a unique string.
         ActiveDocument.FormFields("text1").Result = "****"
         If ActiveDocument.ProtectionType <> wdNoProtection Then
             ActiveDocument.Unprotect
         End If
         Selection.GoTo What:=wdGoToBookmark, Name:="Text1"
         Selection.Collapse
         Selection.MoveRight wdCharacter, 1
         Selection.TypeText (String(256, "W"))
         Selection.GoTo what:=wdGoToBookmark, Name:="Text1"
         ' Remove unique characters from Text1 form field.
         With Selection.Find
            .Execute findtext:="*", replacewith:="", replace:=wdReplaceAll
         End With
         ActiveDocument.Protect Password:="", NoReset:=True, Type:= _
            wdAllowOnlyFormFields
      End Sub
