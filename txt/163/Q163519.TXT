TITLE   :DSPU Reconnect Failure After An Outage
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11,2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Downstream physical unit (DSPU) fails to recover its connection to SNA Server
after a link failure between the two devices.

CAUSE
=====

When SNA Server receives a format 3 XID from an incoming DSPU that specifies a
secondary link station role without preceding it with a negotiable XID, the SNA
Server may cause a SABM(E) to be sent immediately without first sending its own
format 3 XID. This causes the DSPU to drop the connection.

RESOLUTION
==========

An update to SNA Server ensures that SNA Server always sends at least one
non-NULL XID.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.0, 2.1,
2.11 and 2.11 Service Pack 1 (SP1).
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word
