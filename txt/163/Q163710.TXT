TITLE   :ResKit Tool Global.exe Returns Incomplete User List
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Global.exe, a tool from the Windows NT 4.0 Server Resource Kit, is designed to
list members from specified domain global groups. For example, the command
GLOBAL "DOMAIN ADMINS" NEWYORK should list the users in the global group called
DOMAIN ADMINS on the domain NEWYORK. The command may not return a complete list
of users. When this problem occurs, typically, only one or two users from the
group are listed. This is true whether the command is run on a domain controller
or remotely from a Windows NT 4.0 workstation or member server.

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: Global.exe did not ship in the first Windows NT 4.0 Server Resource Kit
release; however, it became available for the Intel x86 at the following ftp
address:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/reskit/nt40/i386

This issue has only been seen with an earlier version of Global.exe posted on the
FTP site.

This issue has been resolved in the latest version of Global.exe and can be
obtained at the FTP location listed above or from the Resource Kit Supplement
One or Two.
