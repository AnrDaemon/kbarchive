SYMPTOMS
========

Arp.exe will not use a specified source IP address when there are multiple IP
addresses from the same subnet assigned to the same network adapter.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft's TCP/IP implementation uses the first IP address that is assigned to
the network adapter when there is more than one IP address for the same subnet.
This is by design.

RFC 826 does not cover specifying a source IP address when there is more than one
IP addresses assigned to the same network adapter.

RESOLUTION
==========

Arp does use the specified IP address when there are multiple network adapters,
each with an IP address on the same subnet.
