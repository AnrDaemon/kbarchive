TITLE   :NDIS Driver Fails To Check Functional Address
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

On a computer running Windows NT and using Token Ring network cards, packets
that are addressed to certain functional addresses may be dropped, indicating a
failure in the NDIS (network driver interface specification) driver.

CAUSE
=====

The NDIS driver fails to check for combined functional addresses in order to
find a matching address to the destination functional address of the incoming
packet. A combined functional address is the logical OR of multiple functional
addresses that the token ring network card listens to.

RESOLUTION
==========

The NDIS driver has been modified to check for combined functional addresses.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
