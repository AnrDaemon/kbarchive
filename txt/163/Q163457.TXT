SYMPTOMS
========

When modifying a Word 7.0 template in Word 97, a custom toolbar button that is
assigned to a macro will reappear after the toolbar button is removed and the
template is saved as a Word 97 template.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the following procedure to remove your custom toolbar buttons and then
re-create the desired buttons in Word 97:

1. Open the Word 7.0 template in Word 97.

2. On the Tools menu, click Customize.

3. Under Toolbars, click the toolbar that contains the custom toolbar button,
   and then click Reset.

   Word will present the Reset Toolbar dialog box, prompting you to:

   Reset changes made to <toolbar name> toolbar for: <macro name>

   Click OK. The custom toolbar button will be deleted, and the macro will be
   retained.

   NOTE: This procedure will reset all custom toolbar buttons on the specified
   toolbar.

4. Re-create any toolbar buttons you may want assigned to your macros.

5. Save and close your template after making your changes.

   Word will prompt you with the following message when you save your Word 7.0
   template in Word 97:

   The template <file name> and its macros will be converted to Word 97
   format when this template is saved. Do you want to save the converted
   template to a new file, or overwrite <file name>?

   Do one of the following:
    - Click "New File" to save your Word 7.0 template to a new Word 97 template
      name.

      NOTE: You will now have two versions of the template on your system. One
      template in Word 7.0 format and one template in Word 97 format.

      -or-

    - Click "Overwrite" to save your Word 7.0 template to a Word 97 template
      using the same template name.

      NOTE: Your Word 7.0 template will not exist anymore. It will be converted
      to a Word 97 template. You will no longer be able to use the template in
      Word 7.0.
