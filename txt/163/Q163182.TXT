TITLE   :ODE97: ODE Setup Does Not Check for MS Access 97 or Office 97
PRODUCT :Microsoft Access Distribution Kit
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Office Developer Edition Tools Setup program does not display a
warning message if it cannot find Microsoft Access 97 or Microsoft Office 97
Professional Edition installed on your computer. However, when you try to run
certain components that are included in the ODE, you receive error messages.

NOTE: You will also receive an error message if the Help files for Microsoft
Access are not installed on your local hard disk.

CAUSE
=====

The Setup program does not check your hard disk for previously installed
applications before it installs the ODE. However, to have the full functionality
of the Microsoft Office Developer Edition Tools (ODE), you must have Microsoft
Access 97 or Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition installed on your
computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install Microsoft Access 97 or Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition, which
includes Microsoft Access 97, on your computer before you try to run the
Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access 97.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Even though the Setup program does not check for an installed copy of Microsoft
Access 97 or Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition when you run Setup, you
must have a copy of Microsoft Access 97 installed before you can create run-time
applications.

Some components of the ODE require certain files that are installed with either
Microsoft Access 97 or Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition. For example,
the ODE Setup Wizard opens in Microsoft Access 97. If you try to run the ODE
Setup Wizard without Microsoft Access 97 being installed on your hard disk, a
Program Not Found dialog box is displayed.
