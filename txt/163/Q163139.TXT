TITLE   :XADM: Err Msg 1005: Access Is Denied

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 to an NTFS
partition, you may receive the following error message when the services attempt
to start:

   Error 0005 Access is denied.

The corresponding Event Log error is as follows:

   Event ID: 1005
   Source:   MSExchangeSA
   Type:     Error

   Description:
   The description for Event ID ( 1005) in Source ( MSExchangeSA ) could
   not be found. It contains the following insertion string(s):
   <<0xc0040000 - Network problems are preventing connection to the
   Microsoft Exchange Server computer. Contact your system administrator if
   this condition persists. MAPI was unable to load the information service
   emsabp.dll. Be sure the service is correctly installed and configured.
   Microsoft Exchange Address Book ID no: 00040380-0000-00000000>>.

This is a result of insufficient Security permissions to the Exchsrvr directory
structure. During Setup, the security privilege of Full Control is assigned to
the group Everyone for the EXCHSRVR directory structure. The service account
requires Full Control access to this directory structure.

NOTE: These are the NTFS file/directory permissions, not the Share Level
permissions.

If the Everyone group permissions are changed on this directory structure, this
may affect the ability of the Exchange Services to start properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To restore the Everyone group permissions, follow the procedure for your version
of Windows NT Server, as shown below:

For Windows NT Server 4.0:

1. Start Windows NT Explorer.

2. Right-click the Exchsrvr directory. Click Properties.

3. On the Security tab, click the Permissions button.

4. Select the group Everyone.

5. In the list box, select Full Control.

6. Select the Replace Permissions on Subdirectories check box and the Replace
   Permissions on Existing Files check box.

7. Click OK, and then click Yes.

For Windows NT Server 3.51:

1. Start File Manager.

2. Select the Exchsrvr directory.

3. Select Security, and then click Permissions.

4. Select the group Everyone.

5. In the list box, select Full Control.

6. Select the Replace Permissions on Subdirectories check box and the Replace
   Permissions on Existing Files check box.

7. Click OK, and then click Yes.

This will replace the default permissions for the Group Everyone in which the
Service Account is a member.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Here are some other errors that may result if the Service Account has
insufficient NTFS permissions on the EXCHSRVR directory structure.

 - The Directory may fail with a 2140 resulting in an Event ID. -1032.

   resulting in an Event ID. -1811 or a Server Specific error 4294966264
   resulting in an Event ID. -1032.
