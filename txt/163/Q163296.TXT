SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA) events 2200 and 2201
typically indicate that there were thread conflicts while trying to lock the
03000002 object. This object contains reference counts for all other objects. As
a result, the 03000002 object is heavily used, which results in frequent,
temporary locking conflicts.

2200 and 2201 events on object 03000002 are not unusual and by themselves do not
indicate a problem requiring further attention.
