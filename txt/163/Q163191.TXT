TITLE   :WD97: Grouped Drawing Objects Open as a Box in Word 7.0
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a Word 97 document containing a drawing object that is composed of
several grouped line drawings, and you save it in Word 6.0/95 format or Rich
Text Format (RTF), it may appear in Word 7.0 as a single square box.

CAUSE
=====

This is a limitation to the drawing feature in Word 7.0. Word 97 has a drawing
feature that is much more flexible than Word 7.0; therefore, there are some Word
97 drawing features that cannot be supported in Word 7.0.

WORKAROUND
==========

Ungroup the drawing object in Word 97 by following these steps:

1. Click the drawing object to select it.

2. On the drawing toolbar, click Ungroup on the Draw menu.

3. Save the document as Word 6.0/95 or Rich Text Format (RTF)
