TITLE   :WebSTONE Benchmark of IIS May Show Poor Results for MP Systems
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Internet Information Server (IIS) performance drops dramatically on
multiprocessor systems when you test with WebSTONE, a popular web benchmark,
which uses a non-abortive (graceful) close method for TCP sessions.

SPECWEB is another benchmark tool that has shown similar results.

NOTE: This problem does not occur when using regular real-world browsers such as
Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator.

CAUSE
=====

There was a high rate of contention for a TCP resource, which lead to poor
performance.


RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated Tcpip.sys to correct the problem. Instructions for
installing it are available from Microsoft support channels, or directly from
the following Internet location:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/NT40/hotfixes-postSP2/TCPIP-fix


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51 and 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-tested and should
be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are
severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical
Support for more information.
