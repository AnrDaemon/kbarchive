KEYWORDS:kbtool kbvfp kbvfp500aFIX kbvfp500bugkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Setup /F from distribution disks, you may receive the following
error:

   Setup error 997, Object ##: Your setup files may be damaged. Try restarting
   the setup program.

where ## may be different numbers.

CAUSE
=====

The Setup /F is for disk volumes that do not support long file names. If the
Program Item Description in step 6 of Setup Wizard or Program Group name in step
5 of Setup Wizard is greater then 8 characters or it has spaces, you receive the
error.


RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure that there are no files or directories with long file names. Also,
ensure that the Program Item Description and Program Group Name are no longer
than 8 characters and that the names do not contain spaces.

This has been corrected in an updated version of the Setup Wizard. For more
information about how to obtain the new Setup Wizard, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
