KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Windows NT 4.0 Setup on an IBM ThinkPad 535, a blue screen trap
occurs.

CAUSE
=====

When Pcmcia.sys initializes a PCI PCMCIA controller, its I/O port may be
relocated to bad I/O resources that may conflict with other I/O ports owned by
drivers not yet loaded.

This problem was first discovered on an IBM ThinkPad. The new I/O port had a
conflict with the IDE controller.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install the updated Pcmcia.sys driver.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
