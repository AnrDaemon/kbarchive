TITLE   :RAS Script with Set IPADDR May Fail with 3Com Defender Add-on
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a script that modifies the dynamically assigned IP address with
Dial-Up Networking to connect to a 3Com NetBuilder that is running Defender
Security Add-on, the Dial-Up Networking client uses the initial PPP assigned IP
address.

CAUSE
=====

3Com Defender Security Add-on assigns a new IP address to the client that is
connecting to it. While this negotiation occurs without a problem, the IP
address that is returned by the "getip" function of the script is not put into
the PPP IP address field by the "set ipaddr" function of the script.


RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
