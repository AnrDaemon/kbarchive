TITLE   :SNA Server Application Exception If Invalid Handle
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

An access violation may occur when you run SNA Server 2.11 or 2.11 SP1 on
Windows NT 3.51 or 4.0, if the Windows NT "global flags" entry is enabled to
check for "invalid handle exceptions."

This problem is only observed in special debugging environments where "invalid
handle exceptions" have been enabled by a Windows NT support engineer.

CAUSE
=====

A service handle returned either by OpenSCManager() or OpenService() function
must be closed with CloseServiceHandle() NOT with CloseHandle(). Calling
CloseHandle will generate an exception if "invalid handle exceptions" are
enabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

Close all service handles with the CloseServiceHandle() call.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 2.11 Service
Pack 1 (SP1).


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Product
Support Services for more information.
