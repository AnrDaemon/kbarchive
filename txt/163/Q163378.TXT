KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork win95kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Exchange or Windows Messaging may stop responding (hang) when you try
to transmit a message using SPX over a dial-up connection.

This problem occurs only if the installed version of NWLINK is dated before
6/27/96 and the Wsipx.vxd file is dated before 3/5/97.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs only when Microsoft Exchange or Windows Messaging is started
offline and you use the Deliver Now command to deliver messages over a dial-up
connection.

The problem occurs because WSIPX submits a larger frame than is supported. SPX
checks the NDIS packet frame size against the connection's maximum frame size
and hangs or returns a "The message cannot be delivered" error message. The NDIS
packet frame size is 1497 bytes and the maximum frame size is 1160 bytes.


RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.
