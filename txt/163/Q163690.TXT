SYMPTOMS
========

When receiving a message from a foreign X.400 MTA that has an ISO 6937 Bodypart
and an IA5 Bodypart, Microsoft Exchange Server may log the following event to
the Windows NT Event Log:

   message NMI0210: X.400 Service Event, severity 14

          (MTA DISP:FANOUT(15) Proc 112) 07-25-96 02:16:17pm
