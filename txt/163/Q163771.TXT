KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

Text positioned over shading or other objects may be printed with a white
background when you are using the Windows 95 Matrox Millennium or Mystique video
driver version 3.22.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Windows 95 Matrox (MGA) Millennium and Mystique drivers enable a feature
called "PowerGDI" by default. This feature replaces some functions of Windows
GDI and may cause printed output to look different from when it is previewed.
Most notably, text positioned over shading or other objects is printed with a
white background. To disable this feature, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Display.

2. On the MGA Settings tab, click Advanced.

3. Click the Performance tab.

4. Click the Use PowerGDI Acceleration check box to clear it.

5. Click OK until you return to Control Panel. Note that you do not need to
   restart the computer for this change to take effect.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem can occur when you are printing to most non-PostScript printers,
such as Hewlett-Packard LaserJets, DeskJets, and compatibles, and most
dot-matrix and inkjet printers.

This problem also occurs with the Beta version 3.30 video driver available on the
Matrox Graphics Web site.
