SUMMARY
=======

Sometimes customers need to remove a Requestor or a Remote Requestor object
either to troubleshoot or to make a change in their organization configuration.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that deleting the requestor or remote requestor object will not remove the
hidden custom recipient address. This address will be in the Recipients
container and will be in the form of <network>\<postoffice>\$SYSTEM,
where <network> and <postoffice> correspond to the connected
postoffice on Microsoft Mail.

When you remove a Requestor or Remote Requestor object, this address should be
deleted, and then replication allowed to occur to propagate this change before
another Requestor or Remote Requestor is created. This will prevent duplicate
addresses from being inadvertently created.

To remove the hidden recipient, use the following steps:

1. In Exchange Administrator, open the Recipients container.

2. From the View menu, choose Hidden Recipients. This should allow you to see
   all hidden recipients in the container.

3. Delete the hidden recipient for the $SYSTEM account on the connected
   Network/Postoffice.

When MS Mail sends a dirsync (directory synchronization) message to Exchange, it
sends it from $SYSTEM to the dirsync address of the Exchange local postoffice.
If there are duplicates of the $SYSTEM address, the directory service will not
process the message. In addition, non-delivery reports (NDRs) of dirsync
messages are not returned to the sender nor copied to the Administrator or
Postmaster.

Indicators that duplicate addresses exist are 139 errors in the application log
(with directory synchronization logging turned to maximum) and SrvTx messages
not appearing in the Administrator's mailbox as specified. An additional
indicator is that updates will not appear in Exchange after synchronization.

For information about how to copy dirsync messages to a requestor mailbox on
Exchange, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
