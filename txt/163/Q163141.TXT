TITLE   :Change of Printer IP Address Not Recognized by Spooler
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you create an LPR printer in Print Manager and specify the printer's host
name instead of an IP address, and then change the printer's IP address on the
DNS server or in the hosts file, the Spooler service does not recognize the new
IP address and will log an Event ID 2004 error.

CAUSE
=====

The Spooler service only resolves the host name to an IP address once, when
Spooler service starts up.

WORKAROUND
==========

When the IP address of a printer is changed, stop and restart the Spooler
service.

STATUS
======
