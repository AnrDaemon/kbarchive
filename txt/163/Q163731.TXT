TITLE   :WD97: Bullets and Horizontal Lines Lost After Save to FTP Server
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbualink97 kbwdinternet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you save an HTML document to an FTP server and then insert graphics
interchange format (GIF) bullets or horizontal lines into the document, the
bullet or line images are not copied to the FTP server, and you do not receive a
warning.

When this occurs, the GIF bullets and horizontal lines are missing from the HTML
document the next time the document is opened.

CAUSE
=====

Normally, .gif and .jpg images are copied to the same directory as the document
when the document is saved. When the document is re-opened, the images are read
back in and displayed in the document. However, when you save to an FTP server,
the .gif and .jpg files are saved to the Windows Temp directory instead of the
directory where the document is being saved. During the initial save to the FTP
server, you are warned that this may happen; however, on subsequent saves, you
are not warned.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, manually copy the .gif and .jpg files to the
directory where the document is saved on the FTP server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginnning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem is twofold: first, the .gif and .jpg images are not retained when
you save to an FTP server; and second, there are some situations where you are
not warned that this will happen.

Word displays a warning about the images if all of the following are true:

 - The save location is not a file allocation table (FAT) or a universal naming
   convention (UNC) location,

   -and-

 - there is at least one embedded image,

   -and-

 - the save is the first save of the document.

No warning is displayed if you do the following:

1. Save the document to an FTP server before inserting .gif or .jpg images.

2. Insert the .gif or .jpg images.

3. Update the saved document on the server.
