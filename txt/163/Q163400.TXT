SYMPTOMS

When you perform a new install of Windows NT, the prompt "Boot 2>" is
displayed on the screen after the reboot from text setup to GUI setup.

This condition can occur if the product System Commander from V Communications
was previously installed on the target hard disk. This error can also appear if
the master boot record code is corrupted.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are three ways to work around this problem:

1. Low-level format the drive.

2. Use the System Commander uninstall.

3. After backing up the mbr using disksave.exe, run fdisk /mbr against the
   system and the machine should get past this error.
