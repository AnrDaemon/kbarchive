TITLE   :IIS Access Violation for Polygon with More Than 100 Vertices
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Internet Information Server (IIS) may experience an access violation when it
processes client response coordinates for a server side Image Map. The access
violation will occur if the region selected is a Polygon with more than 100
vertices defined.

CAUSE
=====

IIS defines enough space to store 100 vertices for a polygon region; therefore,
if more than 100 vertices exist in the image map, IIS attempts to process the
additional vertices. An access violation then occurs when the limit of 100
vertices is exceeded.

RESOLUTION
==========

IIS has been modified to allow 160 vertices and ignore any polygon region
defined with more than 160 vertices.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Server versions 2.0 and 3.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack,
