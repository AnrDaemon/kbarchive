TITLE   :GetLuaReturnCode Can Lead To TN3270 Service Access Violation
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11,2.11 SP1,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The TN3270 Server may end "silently," without generating a Drwtsn32.log or
logging an Event 624 in the Windows NT Application Event Log.

An LUA application may also fail with an access violation when calling the
GetLuaReturnCode API; this occurs when it is attempting to map an error code
that the GetLuaReturnCode API does not know how to map.

CAUSE
=====

The GetLuaReturnCode() function (within Luastr32.dll) may encounter an access
violation when attempting to map an error that it doesn't know how to map. This
can occur when mapping either an LUA RUI or SLI error code.

RESOLUTION
==========

An update to SNA Server 2.11 Service Pack 1 and 3.0 is available to correct this
problem. The updated modules are:

   <snaroot>\system\LUASTR32.DLL
   <snaroot>\system\WINRUI32.DLL
   <snaroot>\system\WINSLI32.DLL

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.11, 2.11
Service Pack 1 (SP1), and 3.0. This problem was corrected in the latest
Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 and 3.0 U.S. Service Packs. For information on
