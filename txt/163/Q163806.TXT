PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtshoot kbInventory smsremtshoot smsinv kbRemoteProgkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to locate a client computer running Windows NT Workstation with
NWLink IPX/SPX as the only protocol, remote control may fail with the following
error:

   Unable to locate <machine name>.

If the Site Properties were not configured so that remote control of Windows NT
occurs over IPX, the Systems Management Server Remote Control Agent service on
the client computer starts with the following error:

   Failed to initialize the network.

If you attempt to start that service manually, you receive the following error:

   Could not start the SMS Remote Control Agent Service on \\<machine
   name>. Error 2186: The service is not responding to the control function.

CAUSE
=====

The Inventory agent (Invwin32.exe) does not report the IPX address of clients
running NWLink IPX/SPX as their only protocol. Therefore, the Systems Management
Server Administrator program is unable to locate the client. The remote agent is
unable to bind to the NWLink IPX/SPX protocol.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server version 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
