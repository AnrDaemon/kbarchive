TITLE   :GetLuaReturnCode Mapping Problems and Possible Access Violation

KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbprogrammingkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 3.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The following problems occur when calling GetLuaReturnCode() from an RUI or SLI
application:

 - The following return codes are not mapped properly:

      LUA_RECEIVED_UNBIND 0x55
      LUA_DATA_INCOMPLETE 0x60
      LUA_LU_INOPERATIVE 0xFF

      LUA_RECEIVER_IN_TRANSMIT_MODE  0x081B0000
      LUA_SSCP_LU_SESSION_NOT_ACTIVE 0x08570000

      LUA_RESPONSE_ALREADY_SENT  0x10050122

   Also, GetLuaReturnCode reports these unmapped return codes in Intel
   byte-reversed format. For example, a sense code of 0x081B0000 may be returned
   as 0x00001B08.

 - If GetLuaReturnCode() receives a primary_rc or the secondary_rc that it
   doesn't expect, this may lead to an access violation in LUASTR32.DLL.

CAUSE
=====

These problems are caused by deficiencies in the GetLuaReturnCode() function.

RESOLUTION
==========

An update to SNA Server 2.11 Service Pack 1 and 3.0 is available to correct
these problems. The updated modules are Luastr32.dll, Winrui32.dll and
Winsli32.dll.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.1, 2.11,
2.11 Service Pack 1 (SP1), and 3.0. This problem was corrected in the latest
Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 and 3.0 U.S. Service Packs. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
