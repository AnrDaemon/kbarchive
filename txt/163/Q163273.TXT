TITLE   :User Manager Disables RAS Dial-in Permissions After Applying SP5
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After running User Manager for Domains (USRMGR.EXE) and changing or viewing a
user account on a domain controller or member server that has Windows NT Service
Pack 5 (SP5) installed, RAS users may receive an error indicating that they do
not have permission to dial into the domain.

CAUSE
=====

There was a change to Usrmgr.exe included with Service Pack 5 for Windows NT
3.51 that was specific to the Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare
(FPNW.) When viewing or modifying a user's account in User Manager on a computer
that has Service Pack 5 installed, the user account information containing the
RAS dial-in permissions and call-back phone number is incorrectly reset to
default (no permission.) This problem does not occur if FPNW is installed on the
system.


RESOLUTION
==========

An updated version of Usrmgr.exe is now available that fixes this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A
supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
