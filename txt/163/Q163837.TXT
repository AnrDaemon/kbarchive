KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbSDKPlatform kbSNMP kbGrpDSNetkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use an SNMP utility to obtain the system type from a computer running
Windows NT, the value returned is the same for both Windows NT Server and
Windows NT Workstation. The system types appear to be identical.

Because Windows NT workstations and servers have different capabilities, it is
necessary to differentiate between these versions of Windows NT, especially when
managing a large network. In addition, it is necessary to differentiate between
Windows NT Servers and Domain Controllers, since they also have different roles
in the domain model.

CAUSE
=====

The SysObjectID field (1.3.6.1.4.1.311.1.1.3.1) returned by the computer running
Windows NT is the same if the computer is running Windows NT Server or Windows
NT Workstation.

RESOLUTION
==========

A change was made in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2) and Windows NT 3.51
post-SP5 to the SNMP components so that the different system types are now
reported as follows:

   1.3.6.1.4.1.311.1.1.3.1.1 for Windows NT Workstation
   1.3.6.1.4.1.311.1.1.3.1.2 for Windows NT Servers
   1.3.6.1.4.1.311.1.1.3.1.3 for Windows NT Domain Controllers

This enables the user of the SNMP utility to more precisely identify the type of
Windows NT system.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT version
4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
