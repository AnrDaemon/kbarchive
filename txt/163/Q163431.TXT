TITLE   :16-Bit Application Stops Responding When Run on WinNT 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a 16-bit application on Windows NT 4.0, a second 16-bit application
created by the first 16-bit application stops responding. This same application
will run fine on Windows 3.1, Windows 95, and Windows NT 3.51.

CAUSE
=====

The main application created (spawned) a child 16-bit task and then entered a
loop issuing Yield() calls until the newly created task set a global variable to
True. A race condition existed in which the WOW made an incorrect assumption
about the task, calling the yield function after a new 16-bit task was created.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
