KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbpng

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to unpack a presentation from multiple disks using Pack And Go
setup (Pngsetup.exe), the following message appears:

   The Presentation was successfully installed in <Path>. Would you like
   to run the slide show now?"

When you click Yes, the screen turns blue and you receive the following error
message:

   Error Reading Disk in Drive A:

CAUSE
=====

Pack And Go is searching for the original Pngsetup.exe file and is unable to
find it on the current disk (the last disk in the series).

RESOLUTION
==========

When you receive the "Error Reading Disk in Drive A" error message, insert disk
1 of the series of disks that was created by Pack And Go setup, and then press
Enter.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft PowerPoint version
7.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Pack And Go setup is used to pack a presentation across multiple disks, the
following two files are copied to the first disk in the series:

   Pngsetup.exe      The application that unpacks the presentation on the
                     disks.

   Pres0.png         The first file of the actual presentation information.

When you finish unpacking a presentation, your computer may need to access the
Pngsetup.exe file again. If the file is not on the current disk, your computer
interprets this as an unreadable disk.
