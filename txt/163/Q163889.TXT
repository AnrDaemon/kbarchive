The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

When you set up replication connectors between Microsoft Exchange Sites, all
recipients and public folder hierarchy information will be replicated between
the Sites, regardless of the trust level set on them.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Trust levels for recipients and public folders are intended for use with
Directory Synchronization with Microsoft Mail postoffices only. Trust levels do
not pertain to Microsoft Exchange Directory Replication.

The Trust level for a recipient is found in the Advanced tab of the property page
for each recipient in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.

The Trust level for a public folder is found in the Advanced tab of the property
page for each public folder in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.

For more information, please consult the Microsoft Exchange Books Online or the
Microsoft Exchange Administrator's Guide.
