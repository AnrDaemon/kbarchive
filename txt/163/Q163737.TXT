TITLE   :"( sequence causes DNS ERROR: 204 Unexpected Token "IN"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While importing Domain Name Service (DNS) zone files from BIND or Non- Microsoft
DNS servers, the following error may appear in event viewer:

   Event ID: 204
   DNS Server could not parse unexpected token "IN" in database file (
   <filename> ) , Line 'x'.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by a " followed by a ( in the zone file being parsed.

For example:

acc      IN A  128.222.10.187
      IN MX 5 acc.lex.dp.com.
      IN MX 10 dp-lex.dp.com.
      IN MX 20 dp-web.web.dp.com.
      IN HINFO "(NONE) IP ADDRESS" "CLUSTER"

In the example above, the last record (that begins with "IN HINFO") the "(NONE)
entry will prevent the zone file from being imported and the above message will
be logged in the event viewer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Manually edit the Zone file and remove all "( character combinations manually or
install DNS.exe from Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) or higher. This issue
has been resolved in post-Service Pack 2 versions of DNS.exe
