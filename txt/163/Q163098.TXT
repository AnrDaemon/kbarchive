Use one of the following methods to work around this problem:

Method 1: Record the Menu Action in WordBasic
---------------------------------------------

Using the version of Word that you used to create the original WordBasic macro,
record the actions to perform the menu function, and then convert it to a Visual
Basic for Applications macro.

Method 2: Convert the Code to Visual Basic for Applications Commands
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit the converted macro in the Visual Basic Editor and replace the WordBasic
commands with Visual Basic for Applications commands.

For example, change this converted WordBasic command line,

      WordBasic.ToolsCustomizeMenus Name:="MySubMenu", Context:=1, _
      Menu:="MyMenu", Remove:=1

to this Visual Basic for Applications command set:

      ' On the custom menu "My Menu",
      With CommandBars.ActiveMenuBar.Controls("My Menu").CommandBar
    
         ' Delete the custom sub menu "My Sub Menu".
         .Controls("My Sub Menu").Delete
    
      End With

For more information about CommandBars, from the Visual Basic Editor, click the
Office Assistant, type "CommandBars" (without the quotation marks), click
Search, and then click to view "CommandBars Object."
