TITLE   :DNS Sample File Place.dns Contains an Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0

KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

When you install DNS, a SAMPLES subdirectory is created under the
\%systemroot%\system32\DNS directory.

This subdirectory contains a sample Zone file called Place.dns. This file has an
error in one of the values included in the example Start Of Authority (SOA)
resource record.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Place.dns file contains the following SOA example:

@   IN  SOA     nameserver.place.dom.  postmaster.nameserver.place.dom. (
                               1            ; serial number
                               36000        ; refresh   [1h]
                               600          ; retry     [10m]
                               86400        ; expire    [1d]
                               3600 )       ; min TTL   [1h]

The value shown for Refresh is 36000. The comment shows this as [1h], or one
hour. However, the value should actually read 3600, which is the correct amount
of seconds in one hour (this is also the default setting for this value).
