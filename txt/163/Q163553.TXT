TITLE   :Error Message: Error Initializing the Cache
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::2,2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:osr2 win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when you are prompted to log in
after the first reboot after reinstalling OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2), or when
you are initially setting up the network components after you are prompted to
supply the computer name and workgroup:

   Error Initializing the cache. Shutdown all programs and run scandisk or
   chkdsk. Delete the cache, cookies and history directories in your windows
   directory and then restart IE. If the problem persists reinstall IE.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows folder may contain one or more of the following files:

 - Temporary Internet Files

 - Cookies

 - History

The presence of one or more of these files prevents Runonce from creating the
Temporary Internet Files, Cookies, or History folder that Microsoft Internet
Explorer needs to store cached data.

This error can also be caused if the thread that reads data from and writes data
to these folders attempts to access the folders before the thread that creates
the folders has finished.


RESOLUTION
==========

If a file with one of the names listed above exists in the Windows folder,
remove the file. Then, run Setup again or add the network components.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The first reboot may take a long time if Internet Explorer cannot set up the
Temporary Internet Files, Cookies, or History folders.

During the first boot, you may see the error message six times; five consecutive
times, and then once during the setup of Control Panel. There is a timeout each
time you receive the error message.
