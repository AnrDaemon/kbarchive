The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 1, 2, 2.1

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Windows 95 TCP/IP client without WINS or LMHOSTS entries tries to log on to
a Windows NT domain over a routed IP network, the logon may not succeed and you
may receive an error message similar to the following message:

   No domain server was available to validate your password. You may not be able
   to gain access to some network resources.

CAUSE
=====

To log on to a Windows NT domain, clients must be able to resolve the
domain<1C> NetBIOS name. Windows 95 clients can resolve only NetBIOS names
ending in <00> and <20> when using DNS.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
