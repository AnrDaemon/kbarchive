======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Visual FoxPro ODBC Driver Help File has conflicting information on the
availability of the INDEX ON command.

RESOLUTION
==========

The INDEX ON command is not supported in the Visual FoxPro ODBC driver. However,
it is possible to create regular indexes on existing tables, through the ODBC
driver, using the ALTER TABLE command. To do this create a persistent relation
to the same table, or another, then break the relationship with the "DROP
FOREIGN KEY" clause but use the SAVE clause to preserve the tag.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Bring up the Visual FoxPro ODBC Help file by selecting ODBC from the Windows
Start menu, and selecting "Visual FoxPro ODBC Driver," or by double- clicking
the file Drvvfp.hlp in the Windows\System or Windows\System32 subdirectory. Go
to Contents tab, click Technical References, then select "Language Support in
Rules, Triggers, Default Values, and Stored Procedures." If you look at this
list of commands and functions supported, INDEX is shown. However, if the hot
link, located at the top of the page, is taken to the "Unsupported commands and
functions," INDEX is listed AGAIN.

The INDEX ON command is not supported in the Visual FoxPro ODBC driver.
