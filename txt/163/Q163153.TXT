TITLE   :WD97: "Suggest" Button Missing from Spelling Checker
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbualink97 kbproof word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Suggest button is missing from the Spelling dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Word 97 for Windows uses a different Spelling dialog box than the
other Microsoft Office 97 programs.

This is because Word includes a grammar checking tool, as well as a spelling
checker. These two tools are available from the same dialog box. By default,
Word suggests corrections for words and grammatical errors.

The Suggestions list is unavailable if you have cleared the "Always suggest
corrections" check box on the "Spelling & Grammar" tab of the Options dialog
box.

WORKAROUND
==========

To set or clear the "Always Suggest Corrections" check box, use either of the
following methods.

Method 1: If the Spelling Checker Is Not Running
------------------------------------------------

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. Click the Spelling & Grammar tab.

3. Under Spelling, select or clear the "Always Suggest Corrections" check box.

Method 2: If the Spelling Checker Is Running
--------------------------------------------

1. On the Tools menu, click Spelling & Grammar (Spelling).

2. Click Options.

3. On the Spelling & Grammar tab, under Spelling, select or clear the
   "Always Suggest Corrections" check box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For spelling errors, Word lists suggested replacement words from the main
dictionary and open custom dictionaries. For grammar errors, Word lists
suggested corrections based on the current grammar style and grammar settings.

Previous versions of Word allowed you to use wild card characters in a text
string and click Suggest to get additional words from the dictionary. For
example, typing "d*g" and clicking on Suggest gave you a list of all words that
began with the letter "d" and ended with letter "g".

To accomplish this task in Microsoft Word 97, type "d*g" in the Not In Dictionary
box, and click Change. The word will change in your document, but Word will also
list all of the alternative suggestions from the dictionary. You can then click
on the suggestion you want and it will change the word in your document.
