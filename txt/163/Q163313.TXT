TITLE   :DCA ISCA SDLC Link Service Sets Incorrect Registry Entries
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The symptoms will vary depending on whether this is the first link service
installed. If this is the first link service installed, most of the registry
values will be left empty. Most notably, the DependOnService value for SNAServr
will be missing DCASDLC1, which will cause the SNA Server service to start
without starting the link service. The server will go to an Active state in SNA
Manager, but the connection will not change from Inactive. If a previous link
service is installed, the values will be entered, but incorrectly. In this case,
the connection will go to a Pending state, but will not establish a connection
with the host.

CAUSE
=====

This was caused by an error in the setup file for this link service.

RESOLUTION
==========

A fix has been made to the setup file for this link service.

The current workaround is to use the DCA SDLC link service from SNA Server 2.11
Service Pack 1. To do this, use the following steps:

1. In SNA Manager remove the DCASDLC link service.

2. Copy files from the 2.11 SP1 compact disc to the SNA 3.0 installation folder.
   Copy these files from the <CD>\I386\System\Hwsetup folder of the
   compact disc to the <Snaroot>\System\Hwsetup folder on the hard disk:

   Dcasdlc.hlp
   Dcasdlc.srl
   Dcasdlc.inf

3. Create a folder named Dcasdlc in the \<Snaroot>\System\Hwsetup folder
   of the hard disk and then copy Dcasync.sys from the
   \<CD>\I386\System\Hwsetup\Dcasdlc folder to the
   \<Snaroot>\System\Hwsetup\Dcasdlc folder:

4. Run the External Link Service tools from the Tools menu in SNA Manager.

5. Click Add and select "DCA SDLC link service."

STATUS
======
