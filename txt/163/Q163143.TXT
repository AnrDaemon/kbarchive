TITLE   :STOP: 0x0000001E with Status C000009A
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run some programs, you may receive the following error message:

   STOP: 0x0000001E : (0xC000009A, xxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxx)
   KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when you run a program that puts a high number of locks
on a file. To hold locks, the file system allocates memory from the
NonPagedPool. If the NonPagedPool is exhausted, critical allocations requested
by other system components cannot be satisfied, generating the STOP error
message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

The size of the NonPagedPool is calculated in proportion to the amount of
physical RAM in the computer. The number of possible locks is directly related
to the size of the NonPagedPool. For example, on a computer with 32 MB of RAM,
this behavior has been noted after more than 160,000 locks are set.

To correct this problem, Windows NT now reports an error to the program that is
issuing the locks.
