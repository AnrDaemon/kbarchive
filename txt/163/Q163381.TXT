TITLE   :SMS: Setup Limits SQL Database and Device Names to 21 Characters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup smssetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When specifying database or device names in Systems Management Server Setup, you
are only able to specify names of fewer than or equal to 21 characters. It is
not possible to enter a database name of greater length. However, SQL Server
allows you to create names of up to 30 characters, and the Systems Management
Server Help files indicate that it accepts up to 30 characters.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use device or database names of 21 or fewer
characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
