TITLE   :XCLN: Mac Client Toggles Focus Between Inbox and Message Window
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======


If you paste a large OLE object into a message in the Microsoft Exchange
Macintosh client, click on the Inbox window, and then immediately back on the
message window before the paste has completed, the open message window and the
Inbox window may toggle the focus back and forth.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are two workarounds for this problem:

1. Wait until the paste operation is completed before clicking back and forth on
   the Inbox and message windows.

2. Update the Apple System software to version 7.5.5 and add more memory on the
   system.

Both of these will increase the speed of the paste operation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0, of Microsoft
Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
