SYMPTOMS
========

The Hewlett-Packard (HP) 4M Plus printer using the PostScript driver does not
print duplex at 600 dots per inch (DPI), while 300 DPI works fine.

CAUSE
=====

The 600 DPI setting requires more resources than 300 DPI. The 600 DPI setting
prints four times as many dots per inch as 300 DPI. The default memory in the HP
4M Plus is not enough for most printouts to be duplexed. These printouts will
print duplex if enough memory is added to the printer.

RESOLUTION
==========

The manual for the HP 4M Plus recommends 12 MB of RAM for duplexing legal size
pages. Some printouts may be complex enough to require even more memory to
duplex.

================
