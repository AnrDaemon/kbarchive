TITLE   :IDC Fails to Execute When Access to Httpodbc.dll Is Denied
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT: 2.0,3.0

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you execute an Internet Database Connector (.idc) file, your browser may
display the following error messages, depending on the authentication method
used:

Allow Anonymous Authentication
------------------------------

   Internet Explorer cannot open the Internet site
   "http://www.yoursite.com/scripts/filename.idc?" The requested
   header was not found.

Basic and Windows NT Challenge/Response Authentication
------------------------------------------------------

A dialog box will prompt you three times for your username and password; then you
will get the following error message:

   Error: Access is denied.

CAUSE
=====

Access to the Httpodbc.dll file is required for the .idc file to execute. If
permissions for the Httpodbc.dll file have been denied to the IUSR_Computername
account for Allow Anonymous access or Microsoft Windows NT users authenticated
with Basic or NT Challenge/Response authentication methods, the .idc file will
fail to execute and generate the above error message.

WORKAROUND
==========

Grant NTFS read/execute permissions to the Httpodbc.dll file for all users who
need to execute .idc files. This includes, but is not limited to the
IUSR_Computername account for Anonymous access and any Windows NT user accounts
using Basic or Windows NT Challenge/Response authentication methods.

NOTE: By default, the Httpodbc.dll file is installed to the following location:

   %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\INETSRV\HTTPODBC.DLL
