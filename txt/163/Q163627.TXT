======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In certain cases it may be necessary to defragment a Microsoft Exchange Server
database file offline. If there is not enough disk space on the server running
Microsoft Exchange Server to do this, but there is enough disk space on another
Windows NT Server that does not have Microsoft Exchange Server running on it,
you can perform the defragmentation without having to install Microsoft Exchange
Server. This article will explain how to do this.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To perform a defrag on a Windows NT Server that does not have Microsoft Exchange
Server running on it, follow these steps:

1. Verify that there is enough hard disk space on the server where you want to
   perform the defrag. There must be at least twice the amount of free hard disk
   space as the the size of the database file. If the database file is 10G,
   there must be at least 20G of free hard disk space.

2. Create a blank directory on the non-Exchange server and copy the following
   files to that directory:

      Edb.dll                       - located in the exchsrvr\bin
                                      directory
      Edbutil.exe                   - also in the exchsrvr\bin directory
      Priv.edb, Pub.edb, or Dir.edb - the database file needing
                                      defragmentation

3. From the new directory on the non-Exchange server, run the following
   command:

      EDBUTIL /D <path to the database file>

   For example, if the directory where these files are located is C:\Defrag, and
   you want to defrag the Priv.edb, use the following command:

      EDBUTIL /D C:\DEFRAG\PRIV.EDB
