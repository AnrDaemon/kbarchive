-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+, versions 7.0, 7.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

When a Microsoft Schedule+ user accepts or declines a meeting request, a record
of that sent message will be kept in the sent items folder only if the user adds
additional text to the response.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Schedule+ implements what are called silent responses. A silent response is a
response to a meeting request that has NO additional text added to it. Clicking
accept or decline and then sending that response creates these silent responses.
Silent responses will not be saved in the sent items folder nor will the be
displayed in a Microsoft Exchange recipient's inbox. Silent responses do exist
in the deleted items folder for the sender and recipient.

If the person accepting or declining the meeting request places any text in their
meeting response, it will be saved in the Sent Items folder.

This behavior is by product design.
