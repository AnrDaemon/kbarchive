   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article provides descriptions of the logging categories on the message
transfer agent (MTA) of Exchange Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

X.400 Service
-------------

X.400 protocol events, such as submission and delivery reports.

Resource
--------

Events related to the use of MTA resources.

Security
--------

Events related to attempted security violations.

Interface
---------

Communication among MTA components and between MTAs. Includes RPC use.

Field Engineering
-----------------

Internal debugging trace.

MTA Administration
------------------

Administration program access to MTA queues and routing information.

Configuration
-------------

The configuration of internal parameters and/or problems in one or more MTA
configuration files.

Directory Access
----------------

Events related to the MTA's use of the directory.

Operating System
----------------

Events related to the MTA's use of Windows NT functions, such as thread creation
and file operations.

Internal Processing
-------------------

Events related to the internal operation of MTA application code. Error events in
this category indicate serious problems in the MTA.

Interoperability
----------------

Tracks the binary content of protocol messages. Use this category and Interface
to log stack traces and XAPI traces to MTADATA\AP*.LOG. NOTE: No additional
events are logged to the application or EV*.LOGs when logging is turned up on
this category.

APDU (Application Protocol Data Unit)
-------------------------------------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Tracks full P1 content (MTA send/receive) and fully encoded P1 APDU
(communication between remote MTAs) to diagnose interoperability or conformance
problems. Use this category and X.400 Service to log binary data to
MTADATA\BF*.LOG.

NOTE: No additional events are logged to the program or EV*.LOGs when logging is
turned up on this category.

EV*.LOGs are Text Event Logs. You can enable these logs by updating the registry
key TextEventLogging. To do so:

1. Start the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA\Parameters\TextEventLogging

3. Change the DWord value to 1.

4. Quit the Registry Editor.
