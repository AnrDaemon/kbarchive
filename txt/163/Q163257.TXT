TITLE   :XADM: Dr. Watson, AV When You Create X.400 Address
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

This problem occurs when you create a new custom recipient on a Microsoft
Exchange Server computer and assign it an X.400 address. If you enter
information on the General tab, click the Advanced tab, enter information in one
of the Domain Defined Attributes (DDAs), and then click OK, you may receive the
following error message:

   Dr Watson for Windows NT
   An Application error has occurred and a log is being generated

   ADMIN.EXE Exception: access violation (0xc0000005), address: 0x0050f361

This problem happens more frequently on DEC Alpha computers than on Intel
computers. If you just enter information on the General tab for the X.400
address, and then click OK, the address is generated correctly and no error
messages are displayed. You can then edit that address and add the DDA
information.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

   S E R V P A C K


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was first corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0 Service Pack Service Pack 2.


MORE INFORMATION
================

This happens because of an invalid pointer to a dialog box procedure for the
page. Normally, this would not cause the array to be overwritten but if you have
specified DDA, the string is not parsed correctly.

Additional query words: X400
