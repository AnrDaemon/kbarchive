TITLE   :WD97: Unable to Connect to Web with Browse Web Art Command
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbwdinternet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you create a new blank Web page, if you choose to browse the Web art page,
you will not be connected to the Internet Web Art Resources Page.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if you are using Netscape Navigator 3.0 or Internet Explorer
2.0.

This problem occurs because Word 97 sends a command to your Internet browser that
is dependant on a shell extension that understands that a file that starts with
"http" should be routed to the browser. Neither Netscape Navigator 3.0 nor
Internet Explorer 2.0 install this shell extension.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either the following steps:

 - Install Internet Explorer 3.0 or later (available at
   http://www.microsoft.com/ie/default.asp)

   -or-

 - Type the following address directly in your browser:

   "http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/9798/wd97au.aspx " (without the
   quotation marks)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Web Art Resources Page can be accessed from within Word 97 by pointing to
Picture on the Insert menu and clicking Browse Web Art Page. This should start
the Internet browser and connect to the Web site.

If Internet Explorer 3.0 has been installed, Word 97 will correctly connect to
the Internet Web Art Resources Page even if Internet Explorer 3.0 is not your
default browser. Internet Explorer correctly adds the necessary file extension
information during Setup.

You must be connected to the Html.dot Web template for the Web art feature to be
available.
