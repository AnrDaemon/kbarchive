TITLE   :APPC Password Substitution Fails Intermittently
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11,2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

APPC password substitution fails intermittently. The APPC Password Substitution
feature was added in SNA Server 2.11.

CAUSE
=====

The password substitution code in the APPC library occasionally generates an
incorrect password token. The incorrect token causes conversation initiation to
fail with a security error. Because the error occurrs very rarely, it is
typically seen only in situations where a large number of conversations are
started in a short time. For example, an ODBC application may generate thousands
of queries an hour, and suddenly fail with a security error after two hours of
execution.

RESOLUTION
==========

The SNA Server and SNA Server client APPC libraries have been updated to correct
this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.11 and
2.11SP1. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for SNA
Server version 2.11. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
