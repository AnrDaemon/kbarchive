SUMMARY
=======

In earlier versions of Word for Windows, you can rename, copy, or delete a macro
using the Organizer. In Word 97 for Windows and later, Visual Basic for
Applications project modules can also be copied, renamed, or deleted using the
Organizer.

However, individual macros or procedures stored within a module must be operated
on from either the Macros dialog box or from within the Visual Basic Editor.
