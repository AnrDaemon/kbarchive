IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When the sender capacity is set to 0, secondary sites may fail at Phase 4
because they are unable to communicate with the parent site.

The LAN sender log (Lansend.log) will show the following message:

   Checking for sending capacity. Used 0 out of 0, no sending capacity so not
   checking for send requests.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the following procedure to modify the site
server's registry to restore the default values.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Start Registry Editor and locate the following key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Sms\Components\Sms_Lan_Sender

2. Change the Maximum Concurrent Sendings value from 0 to 5.

3. Change the Maximum Concurrent Site Sendings value from 0 to 3.

4. Exit Registry Editor.

5. Stop and restart the Systems Management Server Executive service.
