KEYWORDS:kbHWMAC kbvfp kbvfp300bBUGkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Set Keycomp is equal to Windows in Visual FoxPro for the Macintosh, the
MessageBox function returns an incorrect value. According to Visual FoxPro Help,
the value returned for a "No" selection is supposed to be a 7.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are a couple of ways you can resolve this issue. One is to hit the
spacebar after moving with the arrow or tab keys to the "No" button in the
MessageBox dialog box. The other alternative is to Set Keycomp to MAC. This
forces the user to use the mouse to select the "No" button. Both of these
options return the correct value (7) for a "No" selection.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
