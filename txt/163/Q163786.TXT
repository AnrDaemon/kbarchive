TITLE   :PRB: Setup Requires Long Filename Support
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:5.00a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbsetup kbvfp kbvfp500 kbbetapublic

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install to a drive volume that does not have long filename
support you receive the following error:

   The specified volume does not support long filenames. You must select a
   destination that supports long filenames, or force the use of short
   filenames. To force short filenames, exit now and restart Setup using the /F
   command line option.

If you attempt to use the /F switch with Setup, you will receive the following
error:

   The specified default directory name is invalid and setup cannot continue.

This setup switch is no longer supported in Visual FoxPro so you must install to
a drive that supports long filenames.

RESOLUTION
==========

You must install to a volume that supports long filenames, such as Windows NT,
Windows 95, or Novell Netware with OS/2 Name Space.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Previous versions of Visual FoxPro allowed you to install to a drive volume that
did not support long filenames by using the Setup /F switch, such as Novell
Netware without OS/2 Name Space, or to a Windows for Workgroups share. This
switch is no longer supported.
