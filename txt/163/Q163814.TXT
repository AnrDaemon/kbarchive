TITLE   :Directory Replication Errors 3208 and 3216 on an NTFS Partition

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you set up a computer running Windows NT Server to export to itself using the
Directory Replicator service on an NTFS partition, you receive the following
errors:

   Event 3208 "The replication service could not update directory tmptree.rp$
   from source on %3 due to error 183"

   Event 3216 "The system error 5 occurred"

However, if you replicate to a FAT partition, the errors do not occur.

CAUSE
=====

The errors may result from corruption in the NTFS permissions assigned to the
export files.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Stop replication and copy the export files from the NTFS partition to a FAT
   partition.

2. Delete the export files on the NTFS partition.

3. Replace those files with the files you copied to the FAT partition.

NOTE: Copying the files from an NTFS partition to a FAT partition removes the
NTFS-specific attributes. You will also need to delete the Tmptree.rp$ directory
created in the import directory.

After this procedure is complete, replication should proceed normally.
