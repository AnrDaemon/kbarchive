In Visual Basic for Applications, you can add or remove menus and submenus using
the CommandBars collection. To remove a submenu, you must use an index in
addition to the CommandBars collection. The index identifies the submenu using
either a number or the menu name.

      Public Sub RemoveSubMenu()

         Dim objMenuBar As Object
         ' Opens MyMenu which contains the submenu you want to remove.
         Set objMenuBar = CommandBars.ActiveMenuBar. _
            Controls("MyMenu").CommandBar
         ' Removes MySubMenu.
         objMenuBar.Controls("MySubMenu").Delete

      End Sub

For more information about using CommandBars, from the Visual Basic for
Applications Editor, click the Office Assistant, type "CommandBars" (without the
quotation marks), click Search, and then click to view "CommandBar Object."
