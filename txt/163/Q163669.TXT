Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in Visual FoxPro version

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create an .exe file in Visual FoxPro 5.0 and place it in a distribution
   directory.

2. Run the Setup Wizard selecting defaults until step 5.

3. Place a different drive letter for default destination directory; that is, if
   the distribution directory was "C:\Test," enter "D:\Test."

4. Run the resulting Setup.exe and note that the default destination still
   points to C:.
