TITLE   :XCLN: Error Messsage: Could Not Schedule Fax for Transmission
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to send a fax from Microsoft Exchange Client in a profile that
contains both the Exchange Server Service AND the Windows 95 fax service, you
may receive the following error messages during the rendering of the fax:

   Could not schedule fax for transmission.

   -OR-

   File system error.

CAUSE
=====

Norton Antivirus is enabled on the Windows 95 computer, preventing the fax from
being properly rendered in the Windows/Spool directory.

Also files in the Windows/Spool/Fax directory can prevent the fax from being
properly rendered.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, try any of the following:

 - Remove or disable Norton Antivirus.

 - Create two Microsoft Exchange profiles: one with Exchange Server service
   (only) and one with only Fax service.

 - Remove any files that are in the Windows/Spool/Fax directory.

 - This may also happen when a blank fax is attempted to be sent without a
   subject or cover page. This can be avoided by adding a Subject line or a
   coverpage to a blank fax.
