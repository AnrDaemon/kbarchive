TITLE   :XADM: SQL MS Mail Messaging Breaks After Upgrading Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you upgrade Windows NT Server from version 3.51 to version 4.0, you will no
longer be able to send Microsoft Mail messages from a SQL Server.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, reconfigure the messaging environment with a
computer running Microsoft Exchange Server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can set up SQL Server to send mail messages with Microsoft Mail 3.x. In
Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0, you can only send a mail message through
Microsoft Exchange Server in a SQL Server environment. If Windows NT Server 3.51
is upgraded to Windows NT Server 4.0 with a Microsoft Mail messaging environment
for SQL Server, new MAPI DLLs are overwritten as the Microsoft Mail client is
upgraded to the Windows NT Server Windows Messaging System (WMS).
