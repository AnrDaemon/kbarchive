======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

SUMMARY
=======

When you distribute an ActiveX control with your run-time application, include
the .ocx file for the ActiveX control and any .dll or other supporting files
needed by the control.

To make this easier, the Setup Wizard supports the use of dependency (.dep)
files. The .dep file for an ActiveX control contains information specifying the
files that are required to use the control. Each ActiveX control supplied with
Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools (ODE) has a corresponding .dep
file.

This article lists the supporting files that appear in the .dep files for the
ActiveX controls included in the ODE.

MORE INFORMATION

The following file(s) are required for the ActiveX controls included with

NOTE: All .dll and .ocx files should be installed in the C:\Windows\System folder
so that they can be shared with other applications. The Setup Wizard suggests
this path automatically for ActiveX (.ocx) control files.
