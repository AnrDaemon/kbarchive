PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbProgramming

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

On a computer running Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, a Win32 Service cannot set a
hook on a 32-bit GUI application.

CAUSE
=====

When an interactive service wants to hook a user's process, it is not allowed to
because the desktop opened does not have the DF_ALLOWOTHERACCOUNTHOOK flag set.


RESOLUTION
==========

A fix was developed such that if "Allow Service to Interact with Desktop" is
set, the service is allow to set hooks on a user's process. This fix requires
Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 Service Pack 2 to be installed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
