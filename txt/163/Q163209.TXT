TITLE   :SNA Server Fails to Send STSN Error from SLI Application
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11,2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If an SLI application registers an SLI_STSN_ROUTINE to handle the Set and Test
Sequence Numbers (STSN) command from the host PLU, the SLI application may
accept or reject the host sequence number.

If the SLI application rejects this command, it sets the lua_primary_rc to
LUA_NEGATIVE_RSP and overwrites the STSN RU with the appropriate sense code
error. However, SNA Server only sends a TERMSELF to the host, and fails to send
the error indicated by the SLI application.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server SLI interface issues an RUI_TERM immediately after the RUI_WRITE
that contained the sense data indicated by the SLI application. The SNA Server
incorrectly drops the RUI_WRITE sense data, and only sends the TERMSELF
resulting from the RUI_TERM.

RESOLUTION
==========

An update to SNA Server 2.11 Service Pack 1 is available to correct this
problem. The updated module is Snaservr.exe.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.0, 2.1,
2.11 and 2.11 Service Pack 1 (SP1); this problem is fixed in SNA Server 3.0.


A supported fix is now for 2.11 SP1, but has not been fully regression- tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless
you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that
you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
