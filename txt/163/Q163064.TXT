TITLE   :ODE97: Uninstalling Access or Office Pro 97 May Break Run-Time A
PRODUCT :Microsoft Access Distribution Kit
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.

SYMPTOMS
========

If you set up Microsoft Access 97 or Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition
with the Run From CD-ROM or Run From Network Server option, and then you remove
(uninstall) Microsoft Office from your computer, you may receive the following
error message when you try to start a Microsoft Access 97 run-time application:

   Unable to initialize the system registry.
   Rerun Microsoft Access or Office Setup.

CAUSE
=====

This error only occurs when the following events occur in the order listed:

 - You set up Microsoft Access 97 or Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition
   with the Run from CD-ROM or Run from Network Server option.

 - You run Setup for a Microsoft Access 97 run-time application.

 - You uninstall Microsoft Access 97 or Microsoft Office 97 Professional
   Edition.

This error occurs because the Setup program for the run-time application detects
that certain Microsoft Office components (such as Msaccess.exe) are available on
the CD-ROM or network file server, so it does not install them on your hard
drive. After you uninstall Microsoft Office, the components on the CD-ROM or the
server are no longer available for the run- time application to use.

RESOLUTION
==========

You must remove and reinstall your run-time application so that the required
files for Microsoft Access 97 run-time components will be copied to your hard
drive.

REFERENCES
==========

For more information about installing run-time applications on a computer that
installed Microsoft Access or Microsoft Office 97 with the Run from CD-ROM or
Run from Network Server options, start the ODE Tools Setup Wizard, and then
click the Tips button on the first screen of the Setup Wizard.
