======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the NET USE or NET VIEW commands to attempt to establish a session to
a computer running Windows NT, you may receive the following error from a
real-mode Windows 95 client:

   Error 58: This operation cannot be performed by the specified server. Make
   sure that you have specified the correct computer name and command. If the
   problem persists, contact your network administrator.

If you type NET HELPMSG 58 on a Windows NT computer, you receive the following
message:

   The specified server cannot perform the requested operation.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by an expired password on the computer running Windows
NT. A network trace shows the following error returned by the server:

   SMB: R session setup & X - Server Error, (2242) Password Expired
      SMB: SMB Status = Server Error, (2242) Password Expired
         SMB: Error class = Server Error
         SMB: Server error code = Password Expired

If you type NET HELPMSG 2242 on a Windows NT computer, you receive the following
message:

   The password of this user has expired.

Therefore, the password has expired. You will not be able to perform any network
tasks until you change the password.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use User Manager to change the password on the Windows
NT computer.
