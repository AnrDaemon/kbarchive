TITLE   :FP: Unable to Save to IIS Server if Permissions Incorrect
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER::; WINDOWS:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for Windows 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q194444.

SYMPTOMS
========

As either author or administrator, when you attempt to save a file on a
Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), you receive the following error
message

   The directory that would hold URL '<filename.htm>' does not exist on
   the server.

where <filename.htm> is the name of the file that you attempted to save.

CAUSE
=====

You do not have the correct access permissions to the IIS directory structure in
which you are trying to save your file.

When FrontPage attempts to write the file, it calls the Author.dll or Author.exe
program in the Web it is trying to write to. FrontPage passes sufficient
arguments to Author.dll to enable it to create the file. When the account is not
granted at least LIST access permission to the directories enclosing the
location of the Web documents, Author.dll is not able to access sufficient
information to construct the proper path in the file system. Enabling LIST
rights simply allows the account to "see" the name of the directory. Once
Author.exe can do this, it has sufficient information to place the new file in
the file system of the Web server.

RESOLUTION
==========

In File Manager (Windows NT 3.51) or Windows Explorer (Windows NT 4.0), select
each directory that encloses the IIS document root (home) directory, and grant
LIST permissions to the author or administrator account or to a group in which
the author or administrator is a member.

MORE INFORMATION
================
