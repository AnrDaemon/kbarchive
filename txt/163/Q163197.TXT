TITLE   :Some Western Digital Chipsets Do Not Support 65,000 Colors
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINNT:.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdisplay

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When installing the video driver for the Western Digital 90C31 chipset, the
option for 65,000 colors is not displayed. This problem may also occur with the
other Western Digital chipsets.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT cannot support 16 bits per pixel (bpp) because the hardware itself
does not support the mode. The only Western Digital chipset on the Windows NT
Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) included on the Windows NT 4.0 media that has
the capability of supporting this mode is Western Digital 90C24A. This chipset
commonly comes standard in laptop computers, and can support 65,000 colors (16
bpp) if the computer's onboard video BIOS supports this mode.

The third-party products discussed here are manufactured by vendors independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
