SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a program that uses Windows Sockets over the IPX/SPX
protocol, you may receive either of the following error messages in Windows 95:

 - A fatal exception 0E has occurred at <00xx:xxxxxxxx> in VxD WSIPX(01) +
   <xxxxxxxx>. The current application will be terminated.

 - An exception 0E has occurred at <00xx:xxxxxxxx> in VxD WSIPX(01) +
   <xxxxxxxx>. This was called from <00xx:xxxxxxxx> in VxD NDIS(01)
   + <xxxxxxxx>. It may be possible to continue normally.

CAUSE
=====

These errors can occur if a buffer being used by a Windows Sockets program is
freed by Windows Network Sockets for IPX (WSIPX) inadvertently and the
IPX/SPX-compatible protocol (NWLINK) then tries to access the buffer.


RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
