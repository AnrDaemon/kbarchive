TITLE   :Cannot Unlock Workstation If Password Change Cancelled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A user logs on interactively to a Windows NT computer using an account whose
password is about to expire. Windows NT displays a dialog box notifying the user
that the password will expire shortly and offers the option to change it. The
user selects "Yes" to change the password, but in the Password Change dialog
box, the user selects "Cancel." The logon script proceeds and the user's desktop
appears as normal.

However, if the workstation is subsequently locked, either interactively or by a
secure screen saver, the logged on user will be unable to unlock the computer.
Despite using the correct credentials, the following message is displayed:

   The password is incorrect. Please retype your password. Letters in passwords
   must be typed using the correct case. Make sure that Caps Lock is not
   accidentally on.


WORKAROUND
==========

Unlock the workstation using another administrative account.

STATUS
======
