-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft Schedule+ for the Apple Macintosh, version 7.5

SUMMARY
=======

When Microsoft Schedule+ files are kept on a Microsoft Exchange server, the
schedules may be viewed and modified by other Microsoft Schedule+ users on both
the Windows and the Macintosh platforms, if those users have been granted
permissions to view or modify the schedules. In contrast, if the Microsoft
Schedule+ files are stored locally, users on the Macintosh platform cannot view
or modify the Microsoft Schedule+ files on the Windows-based computer, and vice
versa.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Exchange Client for the Macintosh, version 5.0 includes Microsoft
Schedule+, version 7.5 in the same executable. Microsoft Schedule+ for the
Macintosh does not support OLE automation or the Timex Data Link watch.
