SYMPTOMS
========

Clock.exe may cause the computer to stop responding (hang) and then consume 90
percent of the CPU time when set to Digital Display under specific
circumstances.

CAUSE
=====

The array for the New Title was too small to hold the contents of the Short Date

RESOLUTION

To work around this problem, use a different Short Date style that is not as
long.
