PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11,2.11 SP1,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In some cases, the mainframe may send the logon screen down before the RUI_WRITE
on the Open has completed. If this occurs, the RUI_WRITE for the response to the
logon screen fails.

CAUSE
=====

A timing issue has been identified that allows the host to send the logon screen
to the client prematurely.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below. In the hotfix,
Winsli32.dll has been modified so that it does not issue RUI_READ for the SSCP
normal flow until RUI_WRITE has completed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server versions
2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 Service Pack 1, and 3.0. This problem was corrected in the
latest Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 and 3.0 U.S. Service Packs. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
