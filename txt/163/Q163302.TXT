The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint 98 Macintosh Edition 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This article contains two sample Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications macros
(Sub procedures) that retrieve the title of a Microsoft Graph version 8.0
object. The second example detects whether more than one Microsoft Graph version
8.0 object is selected.

Example 1
---------

     Sub GetGraphTitle()

        ' Used for error trapping.
        On Error Resume Next

        ' Clear the error object.
        Err.Clear

        ' A reference to an object.
        Dim oGraph As Object

        ' Check if an OLE object is selected.
        Set oGraph = ActiveWindow.Selection.ShapeRange(1).OLEFormat.Object
        If Err.Number <> 0 Then

         ' A run-time error is generated if the selection is not an OLE
         ' object. This code traps the run-time error and prevents it from
         ' appearing.
         MsgBox "Select one graph and run the macro again.", vbExclamation
         End
        End If

        ' Check to see whether the graph has a title.
        If oGraph.HasTitle Then

         ' A run-time error is generated if the selection if not a
         ' Graph object. This code traps the run-time error and prevents it
         ' from appearing.
         If Err.Number <> 0 Then
            MsgBox "Select one graph and run the macro again.", vbExclamation
            End
         End If

         ' The graph has a title.
         MsgBox oGraph.ChartTitle.Text, vbInformation, "Graph Title"
        Else
