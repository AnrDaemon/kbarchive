SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual Basic for Applications, when you create an InlineShape object and set
the height using the Height property, the value returned by the Height property
for the shape does not equal the value used to set the height.

For example, the following Visual Basic for Applications macro creates a
Microsoft Excel worksheet object. The macro sets the height of the object to 200
points. However, when the Height property is used in its functional form to
return the height of the object, the value returned equals 200.25 points.

      Sub GetObjectHeight()
         Dim oILShp1 As Object
         ' Create the object
         Set oILShp1 = ActiveDocument.InlineShapes.AddOLEObject _
         (ClassType:="Excel.Sheet.8", DisplayAsIcon:=False, _
         Range:=ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1).Range)
         ' Set the object height
         oILShp1.Height = 200
         ' Return the object height.
         MsgBox oILShp1.Height
      End Sub

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Height property can be used to return or set the height of a specified
inline shape.
