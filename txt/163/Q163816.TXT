The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

When you print a message from a Microsoft Exchange Windows Client, there is no
built in feature that will allow you to suppress the mail header. This is by
product design. This article gives a workaround that you may use to suppress the
message header if you have WordMail installed and use it as the default email
editor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some people would like to only print the message body and not the entire message
header that includes the mailbox user's name. The reason for this may vary, but
the most common reason is a delegate opening an owner's mailbox, printing mail
for the owner, and the owner does not want their name on the message when it is
printed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To suppress the message header, follow these steps:

1. Enable Word as the default editor. To do this, select WordMail Options on the
   Compose menu and select Enable Word as Email Editor.

2. Open the message and highlight the message body.

3. Select Print on the File menu, click the Current Selection button, and then
   click OK.

This will print only the message body of the message.

If you are willing to use WordMail as your default editor, you can record the
steps one time, turn them into a macro, and assign it to a button on the Word
toolbar. From now on, you just have to open the message and hit the button
created for the macro to print the message without the message header.
