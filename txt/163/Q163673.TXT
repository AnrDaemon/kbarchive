PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::1,2,2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork osr2 win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 1, 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks with the Microsoft
Service for NetWare Directory Services (MSNDS) to connect to a NetWare network
over a dial-up connection, a "Fatal Exception Error 0E" (Invalid Page Fault)
error message may occur when you are browsing or connecting to NetWare
resources.

This symptom has been observed primarily when a Windows 95 client makes a Dial-Up
Networking connection to a Novell NetWare Connect version 2.028 PPP server.

CAUSE
=====

When you connect to certain Dial-Up Networking servers, the MSNDS client
redirector may time out and resend a packet after freeing a network buffer
needed to transmit the packet. When the Dial-Up Adapter driver attempts to
access this buffer to retransmit the packet, an Invalid Page Fault error occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Currently, this symptom has not been reported to occur with the Microsoft Client
for NetWare networks (Bindery version) without the Microsoft Service for NetWare
Directory Services (MSNDS) installed.
