TITLE   :Trap 0x00000024 Occurs During the Autochk Sequence at Boot
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot boot with the removable media in a drive.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because an I/O Request Packet (IRP) is stuck in the
Driver\Disk, causing disk corruption. The Class2.sys file relies on the I/O
system to complete its synchronous requests. These requests may never finish if
Asynchronous Procedure Calls (APCs) are blocked. This will only occur when
removable media is present during the boot process.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install the new Class2.sys driver, which no longer relies on the I/O system to
complete its synchronous requests.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This has
been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 4.0. For
