TITLE   :XADM: Year 2000 Support for DateTime Properties
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbYear2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The RAW display of the last updated field in the properties of a mailbox is
displayed in the format YYMMDD. Although there are only 2 digits for the year,
the actual data is valid up to the year 2079. The date and time of this field is
year 2000 friendly and satisfies the X500 ITU standards. The X.500 ITU standards
recommend that vendors use this format until the year 2010, and then begin
transitioning to a longer date format. The transition should be completed no
later than the year 2025, a 15-year grace period.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Exchange Directory stores datetime Raw properties, such as
When-Changed and When-Created, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) string
format, as specified by the X.500 standards. UTC is the same as Greenwich Mean
Time (GMT).

The UTC format has only two digits representing the year but they are valid for
the years 1980 to 2079. Therefore, this will not be a problem for dates that
rollover to the year 2000 or beyond.

The UTC String format uses the following syntax:

   YYMMDDhhmmssZ

where

   YY = Year
   MM = Month
   DD = Day
   hh = Hour
   mm = Minutes
   ss = Seconds
   Z = Zulu (same as GMT)

For example, a datetime value of 06/03/2000 10:58.20 PM would be represented as
follows:

   000603225820Z

Please note that this value is base on GMT and the hour (hh) may vary according
to location and other factors.
