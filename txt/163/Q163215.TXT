TITLE   :System Policies May Not Work with Third-Party GINA DLLs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Third-party vendors are offering solutions for alternative logon methods, such
as using chipcards or additional network validation. If you use such a
third-party GINA, you may find that System Policies no longer work correctly.

A popular example for such a GINA is included with Novell's IntranetWare NT
Client Services version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A third party GINA is responsible for telling Winlogon about available system
policies. You should contact the vendor about an update for the GINA package.


The third party products discussed here are manufactured by a vendor independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
