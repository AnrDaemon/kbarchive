TITLE   :XCON: Free Form Name Attribute Not Handled By Sprint
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


In a configuration with Sprint as the X.400 provider, Microsoft Exchange Server
is unable to handle messages originated from Exchange due to a problem handling
the Free Form Name attribute of the O/R address.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression- tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Information on the Free Form Name can be found in the Red Book X.420 3.2.1 and
Blue Book X.420 7.1.3 in the discussion of the ORDescriptor. The Free Form Name
is listed in the ASN.1 definition as optional, so the Microsoft Exchange MTA can
send it, and any X.400 conformant MTA should gracefully handle it.
