TITLE   :Event ID 5000 Starting The Shared Folders Gateway Service
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to start the Shared Folders Gateway (SFGW) Service fails. The Windows
NT Server Event Viewer Application log shows an Event ID 5000 with the following
description:

   Load IFS Driver failed with error 1314, A required privilege is not
   held by the client.

   EXPLANATION
   The Shared Folders Gateway service failed to load the Shared Folders
   Installable File System driver SFFSD.SYS.

   ACTION
   Report this error to SnaServer Support.


CAUSE
=====

The user account under which the SFGW service is running requires the user right
Load and Unload Device Drivers. By default the local Administrators group and
local system account have this right. The SNA Server Setup program, when
creating the user account to be used by the SNA services, adds this user to the
global Domain Admins group, which by default is part of the Administrators
group.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the Windows NT Server User Manager for Domains, under the Policies menu
select User Rights. The Show Advanced User Rights option must be checked to see
the Load and Unload Device Drivers user right. Verify that the user account used
by the SNA Services or a group it is a member of is listed here.
