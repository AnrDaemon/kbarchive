TITLE   :XADM: Performance Optimizer Values Change Depending on NT Login
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The initial values for the Microsoft Exchange Performance Optimizer are read
from the following Windows NT registry key:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\PerWiz\Question States

Because this is part of the HKEY_CURRENT_USER tree, the value will be dependent
upon the Windows NT login.

These setting are display settings and do not reflect the actual performance
enhancement settings that have been made to the registry from running the
Performance Optimizer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To understan this problem, let's use the following example:

User A logs into the Windows NT Server and runs the Microsoft Exchange
Performance Optimizer and changes the Estimated # of users to 101-250.

User B logs into the Windows NT Server and runs the Microsoft Exchange
Performance Optimizer. The Estimated # of users does not reflect the change that
user A made.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
