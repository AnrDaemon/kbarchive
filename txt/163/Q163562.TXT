TITLE   :TN3270 Server Does Not Handle DACTLU/ACTLU Sequence Properly
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11,2.11 SP1,2.11 SP2,3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After logging off of some host applications (such as TSO), a TN3270 display or
printer emulator may be unable to reconnect through the TN3270 server until the
user disconnects and reconnects his or her TN session.

CAUSE
=====

With some host applications (such as TSO), the host sends Deactivate Logical
Unit (DACTLU) and Activate Logical Unit (ACTLU) request units to recycle the
logical unit (LU) following a user logoff. The TN3270 Server component
disconnects the LU after receiving the DACTLU.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, reconnect the client.

The TN3270 service and the RUI library have been updated to handle the case where
the host resets an LU by sending a DACTLU followed by an ACTLU.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server versions
2.11 (and all Service Packs), 3.0, and 3.0 Service Pack 1.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
