TITLE   :Windows NT Does Not Recognize Second PCMCIA Network Adapter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1 3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbnetwork kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you have multiple identical PCMCIA (PC Card) network adapters installed,
Windows NT recognizes only the first adapter.

CAUSE
=====

This is a limitation of the NDIS support layer in Windows NT. This limitation
does not exist with PCI, EISA, ISA, and MCA network adapters.

RESOLUTION
==========

To use multiple PC Card network adapters simultaneously, the adapters must not
be identical. PC Card network adapters from different manufacturers, or
different models from the same manufacturer, work correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The optional parameters in the database inform Pcmcia.sys how the slot is to be
configured. This configuration information is required because most network
adapters do not specify the correct information. The following parameters are
valid in this section:

   AttributeMemorySize: REG_DWORD: Size
   CardMemorySize: REG_DWORD: Size

This information is stored in the driver section of the registry. Because only a
single set of optional parameters can be associated with a PC Card adapter, only
one card of a particular type can be used.
