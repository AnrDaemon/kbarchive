SYMPTOMS
========

If you print a shaded table containing text to a Windows NT 4.0 print server,
the text may be printed incorrectly or may not print at all if the Windows NT
4.0 print server is not updated with the Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when a new write time has been detected for the font. This
write time is incorrectly changed when daylight savings changes. If a new write
time is detected, the font won't be used.
