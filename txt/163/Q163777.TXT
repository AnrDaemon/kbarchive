======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 Internet Mail Connector (IMC) and the
Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 Internet Mail Service (IMS) can be used
as a transport for Directory Replication and as a Site Connector. This
facilitates low cost connections for Wide Area Networks where Microsoft Exchange
Servers may not be directly linked or 100% available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create a connected Microsoft Exchange Site over the IMC or IMS, start the
Microsoft Exchange Administrator program and add the other Site (Site A) into
the Connected Sites tab of the IMC or IMS and define an address space (for SMTP
Mail transfer) for the other site. On Site B, add Site A as a connected Site in
the Connected Sites property page. Also, add the address space to allow for SMTP
mail transfer between the two Sites.

When setting up the Directory Replication connector, specify that:

   No, the remote site is not on this network.

You will need to configure each Site separately.
