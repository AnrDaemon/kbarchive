KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbinterop word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you point to Picture on the Insert menu and then click From Scanner, you
receive the following error message:

   Unable to open selected TWAIN Source. If your scanner is a TWAIN compliant
   scanner, please reinstall the software for that scanner.

CAUSE
=====

Word for Windows is not a TWAIN-compliant application. Using the From Scanner
command starts Microsoft Photo Editor. You can use Photo Editor to import
pictures and graphics with the use of a scanner.

NOTE: When you install some graphics editors, a command for that editor may be
added to a Word menu. These graphics editors may also provide scanning options
that may cause similar error messages in Word. For more information about your
specific editor, please refer to the documentation that is provided with your
graphics editor.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you may need to reinstall your scanner software.
Please refer to the scanner's setup information for more information about how
to properly install the scanner software.

MORE INFORMATION
================
