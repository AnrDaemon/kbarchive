KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 3.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If a session failure occurs on an SLI session, any pending SLI_BID request will
return immediately with an error. If the SLI application then calls SLI_CLOSE
followed immediately by SLI_OPEN, the SLI_OPEN will fail with an LUA_CANCELLED
error.

CAUSE
=====

While an SLI_CLOSE is being processed, an SLI_OPEN is being accepted and returns
with an error before the SLI_CLOSE completes. The problem occurs since the
underlying RUI interface has not completed session cleanup on the previous
session failure.

RESOLUTION
==========

An update to Winsli32.dll corrects this problem by changing the handling of the
SLI_CLOSE function. When an application issues SLI_CLOSE, all the pending SLI
verbs are cancelled. This fix changes the order of processing so that all
pending verbs are not returned until the SLI_CLOSE completes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.1, 2.11,
2.11 Service Pack 1 (SP1), and 3.0. This problem was corrected in the latest
Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 and 3.0 U.S. Service Packs. For information on
