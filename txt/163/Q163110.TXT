======================================================================

SUMMARY
=======

The Compaq Smartdesk 2855 cnt75MB21 has a built-in Netflex-2 network card based
on the Intel 595 chipset. This network card is not inherently supported by
Windows NT and requires a device driver from Compaq.

Currently, there is no driver support available for Windows NT version 4.0.

The Compaq driver is contained in a Softpaq file called Sp1251.exe and can be
found on Compaq's Web site.


The Network adapter must be pre-configured using the flashset or softset2
diagnostic disk that shipped with your laptop or docking station.

The network adapter can only be configured for IRQ-11, unless a newer version
diagnostic utility disk is used, contact Compaq Support for more detail.

The Compaq Smartdesk 2855 cnt75MB21 also contains a built-in SCSI controller,
make sure the SCSI controller is configured to use a different IRQ other than
IRQ-11 prior to loading the NIC device driver.

The SCSI controller is based on the Adaptec 151x/152x/AIC 6260/6360 and can use
the supported device driver Sparrow.sys that ships with Windows NT by using
Windows NT Setup\options\add remove SCSI adapter.

For more information regarding this controller, please see the following

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are excerpts from the Readme.txt contained on the Compaq Softpaq
Sp1251.exe for network card support.

1. The NIC adapter should be configured prior to setting it up in NT.

2. In NT, select the Control Panel choose the Network icon select "Add Adapter".

3. A list of available adapters will be displayed. Choose "Other
   <Requires> disk from manufacturer".

4. Insert the Compaq Integrated NetFlex-2 ENET Drivers disk and press enter.

5. A dialog box will come up with "A:\-". Change the path "A:\NT\35" which is
   the path where the driver EPRONT.SYS and setup file OEMSETUP.INF are located.

6. The screen will come up with four settings: Interrupt; I/O Port; I/O Channel
   Ready; and Transceiver Type. Make sure the values that come up match the
   actual board settings as configured with FlashSet or SoftSet2. DO NOT change
   the I/O Channel Ready. The proper setting was already determined. Changing
   this parameter could cause the adapter to become inoperable. Click on OK to
   accept the adapter settings. Click on OK to exit the network configuration
   screen.

7. NT will then perform the binding process. If any additional network software
   options were installed, you may be prompted for specific information for
   these packages.

8. Restart NT when prompted, in order for the changes to take affect.
