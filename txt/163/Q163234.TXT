TITLE   :PRB: User-defined Formats in OLE Drag-Drop Require Byte Arrays
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the SetData method for OLE Drag/Drop functionality, data in a
user-defined format will cause the following message to be displayed at run-
time:

   "Non-intrinsic OLE drag-and-drop formats used with SetData require Byte array
   data. GetData may return more bytes than were given to SetData."

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, make sure that the data being dragged is placed
into a byte array. Decoding the byte array using the GetData is then dependent
upon the methods by which this array was created.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following formats are known formats when using SetData and GetData:

   Name       Constant

   Text       vbCFText
