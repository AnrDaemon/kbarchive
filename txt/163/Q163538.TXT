TITLE   :NTBackup Does Not Properly Eject Tapes on DLT Tape Devices
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under Windows NT 4.0, from GUI or command-line mode of Ntbackup.exe, the eject
command does not unload the tape on DLT style tape drives. The tape will rewind
but doesn't unload. The unload process can be completed by pressing the Unload
button on the DLT tape device.

Under Windows NT 3.51 (GUI only), the tape rewinds and then you hear a click,
which means the tape is unloaded, and then the handle can be lifted to remove
the tape.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the Unload button to complete the operation preparing the tape for removal
from the device. Also, Adaptec EZ-SCSI 4.0 supports the proper unloading of the
tape.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0. This problem was
corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For
