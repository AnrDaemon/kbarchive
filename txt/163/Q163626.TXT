SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when you attempt to start the
Microsoft Exchange client:

   The set of folders could not be opened. The file
   <path>\<filename>.pst is in use and could not be accessed.
   Close any application that is using this file, and then try again.

WORKAROUND
==========

This error can occur if the file is opened by another user or by the same user
from another computer. To correct this problem, verify that no other user or
computer has access to the Personal Folder file.

You may also need to verify if the drive or directory that the file is located in
has been shared on the network. In this scenario, either disconnect any users
connected to the computer or disable the share.
