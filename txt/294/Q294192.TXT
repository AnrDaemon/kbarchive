SUMMARY
=======

When you configure Outlook Web Access (OWA), the Everyone group requires the
"Log on locally" user right on the computer that is running Internet Information
Services (IIS). If IIS is running on a Windows 2000 domain controller, the "Log
on locally" user right must be assigned at the organizational unit level or the
"Log on locally" user right is overwritten by the effective policies at the
Local, Site, and Domain levels, which are disabled or null by default.
