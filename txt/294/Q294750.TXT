TITLE   :SMS: Mandatory Assignments Section Is Unavailable
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbConfig kbMMC kbsms200 kbAdvertisement kbsmsAdmin

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the Schedule tab in the Advertisement properties, the Mandatory
Assignments section may be unavailable. Typically, you can use the New
Assignment option (yellow star icon) to add a new mandatory schedule to the
existing advertisement; however, this option is unavailable.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you have already configured 15 mandatory assignments for
the advertisement. The number of mandatory assignments for each advertisement
cannot exceed 15.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, delete the older mandatory assignments until no more
than 14 mandatory assignments are listed. You can also create an additional
advertisement that includes additional mandatory assignments.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the number of mandatory assignments that are listed in the advertisement
equals fifteen, you cannot schedule additional assignments; therefore, the
option to add additional mandatory assignments is unavailable. This behavior is
by design
