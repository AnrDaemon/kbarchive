TITLE   :Windows NT 4.0 May Hang During Process Shutdown
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400PreSP7Fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A computer that is running Windows NT 4.0 may stop responding (hang) when a
process is terminated. When the hang occurs, the user interface will quickly
degrade until a reboot is required.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT 4.0 may hang if a process allows a file handle to be inherited by a
child process and the parent process (the original owner of the handle) is shut
down unexpectedly. If the child process has initiated a synchronous read on the
inherited file handle at the same time that the parent process is terminated,
the file handle cannot be destroyed. This causes a deadlock in Object Manager
and eventually results in a hang.

RESOLUTION
==========
