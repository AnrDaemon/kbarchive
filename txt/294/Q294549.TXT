SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to insert the Windows Media Player ActiveX Control on
a Web page by using Microsoft FrontPage.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can insert a video into a FrontPage Web using the Windows Media ActiveX
Control. When you use the Windows Media ActiveX Control, the Play, Pause, and
Stop buttons are also included for controlling the inserted video.

To use the Windows Media Player ActiveX Control in a FrontPage Web, follow these
steps:

1. In FrontPage, open a Web.

2. Import a media file into your Web. To do this, follow these steps:

   a. On the File menu, click Import.

   b. In the Import dialog box, click Add File.

   c. In the "Add File to Import List" dialog box, select the media file you
      want to use and then click Open.

   d. Click OK to import the file.

3. Insert the Windows Media Player ActiveX Control. To do this, click on the Web
   page where you want to place your video, and do one of the following:

    - In Microsoft FrontPage 2002:

      a. On the Insert menu, click Web Component.

         The Insert Web Component dialog box appears.

      b. In the Component type list, click Advanced Controls.

      c. In the Choose a control list, click ActiveX Control.

      d. Click Next.

      e. In the Choose a control list, select Windows Media Player, and click
         Finish.

    - In Microsoft FrontPage 2000:

      a. On the Insert menu, point to Advanced and click ActiveX Control.

      b. In the Insert ActiveX Control dialog box, click to select Windows Media
         Player.

      c. Click OK.

4. Right-click the Windows Media Player and click ActiveX Control Properties on
   the menu that appears.

5. Click the Parameters tab. In the Attribute list, select Filename, and then
   click Modify.

6. Under Value, click to select Data, type the file name (or the URL) for the
   media file (for example, type "filename.mpe" (without the quotation marks) or
   "http://localhost/filename.avi" (without the quotation marks)), and click
   OK.

   NOTE: Do not change the Filename box. The contents of the Filename box should
   remain as Filename.

7. Click OK to close the Options dialog box.

NOTE: You can also insert a video on a Web page by pointing to Picture on the
Insert menu, and then clicking Video. In the Video dialog box, select the media
file, and then click Open. This method adds the media file as a dynamic source
that does not include the Windows Media Controls (the Play, Pause, and Stop
buttons) for controlling the video.
