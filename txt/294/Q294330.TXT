PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Server Monitor component of the Exchange Server 5.5 Administrator
program to monitor the status of an Exchange Server computer, the Comment column
may display the server status as follows:

   Microsoft Exchange Computer is Unavailable.

If you double-click the Server Monitor object and then click the Actions tab, all
monitored Exchange Server services display a status of Running.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may occur if the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant service is
running under the security context of the System account.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   Services.

2. Locate the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant service, and then click
   Startup.

3. Click This Account, and then specify the correct Exchange Server service
   account and password.

4. Stop and then restart the System Attendant service.

WARNING: If you stop the System Attendant service, this also stops all Exchange
Server services that are running on the server. You may want to do this during a
scheduled maintenance period or after business hours to avoid interruption of
messaging service.
