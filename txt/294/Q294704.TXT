KEYWORDS:kbVC kbVC600 kbDSupport

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++.NET (2002) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs.

   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

Classes defined in a header file are not being displayed in ClassView in Visual
c++ version 6.0 and Class View in Visual C++ .NET.

CAUSE
=====

Any of the following could cause this problem:

1. A header file extension may be different from the product convention (.h, for
   example).

2. The Class View database file .ncb may have become corrupted.

3. A second instance of Visual C++ may be running with the same project loaded.

4. The Class View database file .ncb has the read-only attribute selected.

5. The project may have been saved to a removable drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

The following solutions correspond to the specific causes noted above:

1. Add extensions (if you are using other extensions for header files like .hh)
   to the registry key:

   HKCU\Software\Microsoft\DevStudio\6.0\Text Editor\Tabs/Language
   Settings\C/C++

   For Visual C++ .NET, add the extension (including the .) to NCB Default C/C++
   Extensions in:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\7.0\Languages\Language
   Services\C/C++

2. If the Class View database file .ncb is corrupt, close the workspace or
   solution, delete the .ncb file, and then reopen the workspace.

3. Check to see if there is a second instance of Visual C++ running that has the
   same project loaded. If the second instance is visible, simply close it.
   However, the second instance may be hidden. If so, use Task Manager or PView
   to close that instance.

4. Check whether the ClassView database file .ncb has the read-only attribute
   selected. Visual C++ must have write access. Remove the read-only attribute.

   This may include removing the file from Source Code Control, or checking it
   out if that is not possible.

5. If the project is being saved to a removable drive, save the project to the
   local hard drive and see if the problem still occurs.
