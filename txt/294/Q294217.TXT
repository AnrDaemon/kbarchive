PRODUCT :Internet Information Server

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 3.0, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

IIS cannot retrieve custom HTTP header variables that contain an underscore
following "HTTP_" (for example, "HTTP_SM_TESTVARIABLE"). The value returned for
the header variable is NULL.

CAUSE
=====

Any underscore ( _ ) that follows "HTTP_" is incorrectly converted to a dash
when IIS attempts to retrieve the custom header value for the variable, and
therefore, the variable is not found.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not use an underscore in the custom HTTP header variable name.

-OR-

Retrieve and parse the HTTP_ALL header variable for the custom HTTP header
variable.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
