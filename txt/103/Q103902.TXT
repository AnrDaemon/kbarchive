TITLE   :PC WRmt: Baud Rate Displayed Not Always Accurate

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows can display a different modem
speed than you are actually using. The setting for baud rate can be overridden
by your modem script, yet you will neither see the configured modem speed nor
the speed displayed.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design.

Because there is no standard return code for modem speed, Remote for Windows has
no way to confirm what modem speed will be used. The modem script often sets the
baud rate, thus taking precedence over the user setting.

NOTE: If the setting is not in the script, the user setting is still required.

Additional query words: 3.20
