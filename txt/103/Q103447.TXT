The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When the External Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE) is started from version 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, the home postoffice must be assigned a direct
drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two stages to running the External Mail program with direct drives:

1. The Mail Administrator physically connects the machine running the External
   Mail program to the postoffice's directory on a file server.

2. The Mail Administrator runs the External Mail program, specifying the drive
   letters of the direct connections.

To specify the drive letters of the direct connections, the Mail administrator
uses one of the following options:

 - In External's .INI file:

   DrivesDirectPO=[drive range]

 - On the command line when starting External:

   /DrivesDirectPO=[drive range]

-or-

 - D[drive range]

By default, the External Mail program assumes that the first letter in the drive
range is connected to the home postoffice. For example, if the machine running
External is connected to postoffices on drives M, N, O, and P, then the
parameter -Dmp tells External that the home postoffice is on drive M. If,
however, the home postoffice is one of the other drives in the range (O and P in
this example), then the administrator must specify the drive letter of the home
postoffice with one of the following options:

 - In the .INI file:

   DriveHomePO=<drive>

 - On command line:

   /DriveHomePO=<drive>

-or-

 - H<drive>
