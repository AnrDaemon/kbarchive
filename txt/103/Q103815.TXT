======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail and Schedule+ Extensions for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You may need to edit the template information fields for version 3.0 of
Microsoft Mail and Schedule+ Extensions for Windows for Workgroups to reflect
the 55-character limit that is the maximum the MS-DOS-based programs can
display.

The templates may require editing to ensure synchronization between Microsoft
Mail 3.0 and the Windows for Workgroups postoffice. You should edit the
templates before you perform the upgrade or the templates may become truncated.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The template file is an ASCII file that can be created and edited with an ASCII
editor such as the MS-DOS EDIT program. The template file consists of lines that
each represent a line in the Administrator program template window. Each line
must follow the format

   <field_prompt>:~<entry_1>~<entry_2>~<entry_3>~<entry_4>~

where:

   Entry          Description
   -------------------------------------------------------------------

   Field prompt   Describes the line
   Entry_1        Specifies the column at which the field data will
                  appear
   Entry_2        Number of columns wide the field data will be
   Entry_3        Specifies the type of data
   Entry_4        Specifies the default field data

Each entry must be separated by a tilde (~). There must be five tildes on each
line.

The entire line in the Administrator program template file cannot exceed 55
characters. The following is an example of a line in the template file:

   Name:~7~48~AP~Name goes here~

This will create a data field in the template for the field prompt "Name." The
data will begin at column 7 and cannot exceed 55 columns. "AP" specifies any
characters and punctuation. "Name goes here" contains the default data for the
field. The total number of columns is determined by the number of characters in
the field prompt, plus any spaces left before the starting position, plus the
field data width.

For a complete explanation of the template file and its function, refer to the
following sources:

 - Chapter 8 in the version 3.2 Microsoft Mail for PC Networks "Administrator's
   Guide"
