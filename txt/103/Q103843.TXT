TITLE   :Cannot Manage Files with Trailing Spaces
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

One of the following messages will appear if you try to move, delete, copy, or
rename a file whose name contains a trailing space:

 - File Manager cannot move <filename and path>: The system cannot find
   the file specified. Make sure the correct path and filename are specified and
   the network is started.

 - The system cannot find the file specified <filename and path>

 - Could not find <filename and path>

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT cannot handle trailing spaces in filenames. This problem usually only
occurs on domains that are connected to Macintosh computers. Under the Macintosh
operating system, filenames with trailing spaces are support. Windows NT
Advanced Server computers connected via Services for Macintosh (SFM) can obtain
files with trailing spaces. However, once the files have been created, it is
difficult to manager them. The filename is not touched by Windows NT and no
MS-DOS FAT-compatible (8.3) filename is created.

RESOLUTION
==========

Rename files with trailing spaces from a Macintosh computer, removing trailing
spaces.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.1. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT 3.5
