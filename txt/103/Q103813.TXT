-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
 - Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks, version 1.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When receiving a message from the Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks server
by way of version 1.0b of Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk
Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows display the
To: field with the addressee's mailbox name rather than the friendly name.

For example, if the friendly name is Administrator and the address is
NET/PO/Admin, the To: field displays "Admin," not "Administrator."

The Microsoft Mail for PC Networks MS-DOS workstation displays the correct name
in the To: field. If you move the message into the .MMF file from the Windows
client (thus deleting it from the MS-DOS client's Inbox) and then you invoke
inbox shadowing, the MS-DOS client displays the mailbox name in the To: field.

CAUSE
=====


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 1.0b of Microsoft Mail
Connection PC and AppleTalk Networks. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
