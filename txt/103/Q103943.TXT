-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1, 3.1a, 3.1c, 3.1d 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Details button in the Addressing screen is unavailable (grayed) after a
gateway recipient has been selected.

CAUSE
=====

You are attempting to get details for a gateway recipient defined by the gateway
server's network manager. Additionally, the gateway recipient name has been
propagated to the current server via an access gateway. If this is the case, the
Details button will remain unavailable when you select a gateway recipient. The
Gateway Installer does not include the necessary resources to allow the access
gateway to obtain detailed information about the gateway recipients when the
access component is installed. Therefore, details on server-defined gateway
recipients are not available to those users on gateway access servers.

However, detailed information for the gateway recipients is available to
Microsoft Mail users whose accounts are defined on the master gateway server.

Gateway recipients created by individual users within their Personal Address
Books will still display details.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0 and 3.1 of
Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
