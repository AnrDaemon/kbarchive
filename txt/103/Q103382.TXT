The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to delete a folder, the following error message may appear:

   Notice 73
   You don't have sufficient rights to access this folder

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do one of the following:

 - Only the person who created the folder (the owner) can delete the folder,
   unless he or she granted delete privileges when the folder was created. The
   administrator can use the Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) to find out who
   created the folder and then ask the user to delete the folder. The
   administrator can also remove the user's rights to create shared folders.

 - Verify the rights and ownership of all files, especially in the following
   directories:

   GLB
   ATT\SUBS
   FOLDERS\SUBS
   MBG
   KEY
   MAI\SUBS
   P1

 - Check for shared folders on the server, and limit the file sharing through
   the network operating system.
