TITLE   :Can't Access Member Server After Password Change
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

If you change your password in a domain controller during a net logon attempt,
and then try to use the NET USE command to connect to a member server, you will
be refused admission because your new password has not yet been updated.

To work around this problem, issue a NET ACCOUNTS /SYNC command after you log on
and change your password, and before you issue the NET USE command. Issuing NET
ACCOUNTS /SYNC forces the user accounts system (UAS) to be replicated and
consequently updates your password. The replication takes some time--how much
depends on the size of the UAS--but it synchronizes your password and restores
your access to member servers.
