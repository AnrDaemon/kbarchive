PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, versions 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Once you have properly uploaded and configured the Host Access component of
versions 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to PROFS, you must log
on the MSGATE ID again to allow certain files and parameters to be properly
initialized.

The ID comes up as normal, but you receive this header message:

   Maximum mailbag size (bytes) that can currently be processed: 00000000

CAUSE
=====

If you IPL the ID without first logging off, the Host Access component is not
properly initialized.

RESOLUTION
==========

Correctly log off the VM ID, and then log back on. This allows the files and
parameters to initialize properly.
