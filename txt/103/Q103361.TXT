TITLE   :16-Bit Windows-Based Applications May Hang w/Network Printer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Windows NT, if you lose your connection to a network printer and it
is set as the default printer, 16-bit Windows-based applications may
load significantly slower than usual or appear to hang completely.

When 16-bit Windows-based applications, such as Write, attempt to
load, they may search for a printer. If the printer is a network
printer and the connection has been broken, the application may load
very slowly or appear to hang.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, install a local printer and set it as the default,
reestablish the network connection, or remove the network connection entirely.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. In Print Manager, connect to a network printer and set it as your default
   printer.

2. Close Print Manager and return to Program Manager.

3. Open Write from the Accessories group twice.

   NOTE: The reason for doing this twice is that if no other 16-bit Windows-based
   applications have been loaded, the first launch of Write will take longer
   because it has to load the 16-bit Windows Subsystem.

4. Notice the time Write takes to load.

5. Close all instances of Write.

6. Unplug the network cable from the network card.

   NOTE: Consult with your Network Administrator before removing any network
   hardware.

7. Restart Write and notice the extra time it takes to load.
