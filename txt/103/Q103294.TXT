NT:

1. Dinosaurs must be run in VGA at 256 colors or better.

2. The CompacVideo driver used for movies for Windows NT was not completed by
   the time Dinosaurs shipped, so movies will not play in Windows NT.

CompacVideo is a video compression format, such as Microsoft Video 1 and Indeo.
Windows NT ships with only Microsoft Video 1 support.
