======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the version 3.0 or 3.2 Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Administrator
program to print a report of the public folders (group folders and shared
folders), the following error message may be displayed:

   Notice 157: Public folders are in use. Report not generated

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when the FOLDERS\PUB subdirectory of the Mail database is
missing the FOLDROOT.IDX file.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can resolve this problem by restoring the file from a backup copy. If a
backup copy is not available, you can run the FIXIDX utility to build the
FOLDROOT.IDX file from the folder files. However, this will result in the loss
of folder names and will also transfer ownership of all folders to the person
specified on the FIXIDX command line.

The FIXIDX.EXE utility is available as part of the Database Maintenance Utilities
document. To obtain the document containing the Database Maintenance Utilities,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
