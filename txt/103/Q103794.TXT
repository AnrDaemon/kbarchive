TITLE   :PC Forms: No Save As Command in Routing Form
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,3.0,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are reading a message created using the Routing Form included with
version 1.0 of Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, the Save As command does not
appear on the File menu. This is unique to the Routing form, since both the
Telephone Note form and the Generic Template include a Save As command.

CAUSE
=====

This feature is by design because the Routing Form is intended to send a
document through a revision process. Saving the form in the middle of the review
process may lead to future confusion.

RESOLUTION
==========

To save the text contained in the Instruction and Previous Comments box, you can
copy and paste the information from the form into a word-processing application.
From the word processor, you can save the information to a file.
