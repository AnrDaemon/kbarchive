The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1

SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT 3.1 and 3.5 do not include a Generic/Text Only printer driver or any
other NULL port driver that allows you to output pure text from an application
that cannot export text on its own.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Use the Generic IBM Graphics 9-pin printer driver.

2. Set it to print to FILE.

3. Format the document with Printer Font.

This produces a file that contains all the text with only a small amount of
control codes. You can then edit the control codes out of the file with any text
editor, such as Notepad.
