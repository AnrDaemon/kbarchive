TITLE   :Running FASTOPEN and CHKDSK Removes File Attributes on CVF
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

If you run FASTOPEN and then CHKDSK on a DoubleSpace-compressed drive, the file
attributes on the corresponding compressed volume file (CVF) on the host drive
are cleared. For example, if your compressed drive is C, your host drive is H,
and you run FASTOPEN C: and then CHKDSK C:, the system, hidden, and read-only
attributes on H:\DBLSPACE.000 are all removed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, restart your computer to have DoubleSpace reset the
file attributes.

Additional query words: 6.00 6.20
