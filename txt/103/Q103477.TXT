TITLE   :ProComm Plus Downloads Slowly Using Zmodem in Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using ProComm Plus for Windows or MS-DOS with Windows NT, the Zmodem
protocol may not function properly, it may take much longer than usual to
download files using Zmodem. The Zmodem protocol is usually one of the faster
protocols available in most telecommunication packages and therefore it is
widely used.

ProComm Plus for Windows 1.02 and earlier have this problem.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem, use a 2 kilobyte (K) or 4K window for Zmodem or
select a different protocol for downloading. Although this protocol functions
properly in other applications in Windows NT, it may run very slowly with
ProComm Plus for Windows or MS-DOS in Windows NT. All other protocols provided
with Procomm Plus should function properly with Windows NT.

For ProComm Plus for Windows 2.0, there is an .INI setting in the ProComm for
Windows .INI file (PW2.INI) in the [Options] section, there is a setting for

   DropRTSAroundDiskWrites=1

where 1 is for Windows 3.x and Windows NT; 0 is for OS/2 and Windows 95.

STATUS
======

This problem does not occur with Windows NT version 3.5.

ProComm Plus is manufactured by DataStorm Technologies, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this products'
performance or reliability.
