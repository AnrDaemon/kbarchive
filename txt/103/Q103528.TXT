======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SUMMARY
=======

You can add SWITCHES=/N, SWITCHES=/F, and SWITCHES=/F/N to the DBLSPACE.INI file
with the following commands:

   dblspace /switches=f
   dblspace /switches=n
   dblspace /switches=fn

However, since there is no DoubleSpace command to remove these entries, you must
do so using a text editor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To remove the SWITCHES entries from the DBLSPACE.INI file:

1. Remove the Read-Only, System, and Hidden file attributes on the DBLSPACE.INI
   file. For example, if drive H is your host drive, type the following at the
   MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER:

   " attrib h:\dblspace.ini -r -s -h" (without the quotation marks)

   NOTE: To determine which drive is your host drive, type "dblspace /list"
   (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt.

2. Using MS-DOS Editor, edit the DBLSPACE.INI file and remove the SWITCHES=
   entries.

3. Save the DBLSPACE.INI file and quit MS-DOS Editor.

4. Use the ATTRIB command to reset the file attributes on DBLSPACE.INI. For
   example, if your host drive is drive H, type the following command and press
   ENTER:

   " attrib h:\dblspace.ini +r +s +h" (without the quotation marks)

For more information on the SWITCHES entry, type "help switches" (without the
quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.
