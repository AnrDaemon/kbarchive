SUMMARY
=======

To install the Bookshelf 1993 upgrade disc, you will need the CD-ROM disc for
any of the previous versions of Microsoft Bookshelf:

 - The 1987 Edition for MS-DOS

 - The 1991 Edition for MS-DOS

 - The 1991 Edition for Windows

 - The 1992 Edition for Windows

The above information is on the back of the Bookshelf 1993 upgrade box. The 1987
Edition is listed as "Version 1.0 for MS-DOS".

MORE INFORMATION
================

During the installation of Bookshelf 1993 upgrade, you are prompted to insert
the disc of the earlier version of Bookshelf. Once Setup recognizes the previous
version, it will ask for the Bookshelf 1993 upgrade disc again and continue the
installation. The earlier version of Bookshelf does not need to be installed for
the upgrade.

If the upgrade installation fails to recognize the earlier version of Bookshelf,
you can force the system to re-read the disc by using F5 in the Windows File
Manager. For more information on this, query on the following words in the
