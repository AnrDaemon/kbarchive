SUMMARY
=======

When using the Microsoft compilers listed above, and the linker is called by the
compiler (no /c option specified), the first directory in which the compiler
searches for LINK.EXE after looking in the current directory is the directory
that CL.EXE was found in. If LINK.EXE is not found in the same directory as
CL.EXE, then the directories specified by the PATH environment variable are
searched.

Additional query words: 8.00 8.00c 9.00
