TITLE   :No Network Option Doesn't Stop Mail and Schedule+ Installation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Windows NT, selecting the No Network option during the installation
will not prevent Mail and Schedule+ from being installed. Unlike
Windows for Workgroups, there is no option to remove Mail or Schedule+
with the Add/Remove Windows Components option of Windows NT Setup.

To remove Mail and Schedule+ from a Windows NT installation, delete
the corresponding icons from the Main group and then delete the
following files from the WINNT\SYSTEM32 subdirectory:

ab32.dll (M,S)

demil32.dll (M,S)

frame32.dll (M,S)

impexp32.dll (M)

mailnt32ap.dll (M,S)

mailsp32.exe (M,S)

mapisrv.exe (M)

mapixx.dll (M)

msmail32.exe (M)

msrmnd32.exe (S)

mspell32.dll (M)

msschd32.dll (S)

mssfs32.dll (M,S)

pabnsp32.dll (M,S)

schdpl32.exe (S)

schmsg32.dll (M)

sendfl32.dll (M)

store32.dll (M,S)

trnsch32.dll (S)

vfornt32ap.dll (M)

wgpomg32.dll (M)

NOTE: If Mail and Schedule+ are removed, the only method to reinstall
them is to re-expand the above files into the WINNT\SYSTEM32
directory and recreate the icons.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.1.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
