The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======


MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade Setup replaces the MEMMAKER.INF file in the directory that
contains your MS-DOS files (typically C:\DOS).

If you have customized your MEMMAKER.INF file, your changes are lost when you run
MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade Setup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Copy your old MEMMAKER.INF file from the OLD_DOS.1 directory. For example,
   type "copy c:\old_dos.1\memmaker.inf c:\dos" (without the quotation marks) at
   the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

-or-

 - Modify the new MEMMAKER.INF file.

NOTE: The new MEMMAKER.INF file contains entries that were not included in MS-DOS
6. For more information, read the comments in the new MEMMAKER.INF file. To do
this, type "edit c:\dos\memmaker.inf" (without the quotation marks) at the
MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.
