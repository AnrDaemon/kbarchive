-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when you run Setup from Data
Expert's original equipment manufacturer (OEM) version of Microsoft Windows
3.1:

   Error: W311US
   System failed!

CAUSE
=====

As an OEM, Data Expert has exercised its right to change the method in which the
Microsoft Windows setup program functions. Data Expert has changed the
functionality of the setup program so that its OEM version of Windows looks
specifically for the specific Data Expert computer BIOS signature. If its BIOS
is not found, Data Expert Windows refuses to install.

NOTE: If you run Setup from Data Expert Windows Setup Disk 1 on a system that
uses a Data Expert motherboard, you should not receive the error mentioned
above.
