TITLE   :SFM: MacFile Menu Not Displayed if NTAS Drive Letter Changes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the drive letter of the logical drive where Windows NT Advanced Server is
installed changes, the MacFile menu in File Manager and Server Manager may not
appear.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT Advanced Server Services for Macintosh records fully qualified
filenames (including paths) to the registry to enable File Manager and Server
Manager to provide MacFile menus. If you change the drive letter of the drive
where Windows NT Advanced Server is installed, Windows File Manager and Server
Manager will not find the Services for Macintosh AddOns and will not display the
MacFile menus.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, use the Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE) and change the
following keys to the correct path and filename:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use Registry Editor can be
solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\File Manager\AddOns

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\Network\SMAddOns
