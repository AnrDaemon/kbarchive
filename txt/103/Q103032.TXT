TITLE   :PRB: "RUN/! Command Failed" with Windows NT

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running FoxPro for Windows under the Microsoft Windows NT operating
system, the error message "RUN/! command failed" occurs when you are using the
RUN command to execute an MS-DOS command.

CAUSE
=====

When the FoxPro RUN command is used without the /N parameter, FoxPro will stop
execution and wait until the RUN command has completed successfully and the
MS-DOS session is closed. However, because Windows NT is a preemptive
multitasking operating system, it switches control back and forth between FoxPro
and the RUN command. This can cause FoxPro to time out while it is waiting for
the RUN command to complete.

NOTE: This problem affects the SetupWizard in the FoxPro Distribution Kit, which
also uses a RUN command, causing it to fail at the point where compression
starts.


RESOLUTION
==========

Use the /N parameter on the RUN command to stop FoxPro from waiting for the RUN
command to complete. The following is an example of using the RUN command with
the /N parameter to execute FOXRUN.PIF. This example also uses the /C parameter
to send a specific command to the command shell.

      RUN /N FOXRUN.PIF /C DIR


STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
