TITLE   :PC Win: File Manager Send Mail Option Hangs Computer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the computer may
appear to stop responding (hang) when you choose Send Mail from the Windows File
Manager Mail menu. This problem occurs only if you use ALT+TAB to select Program
Manager and then select (double-click) File Manager a second time.

RESOLUTION
==========

If File Manager is not maximized, activate a different program by selecting
another application. Or, you can double-click the desktop and bring up the Task
List.

If the File Manager is maximized, you can press F7 to invoke the spelling
checker, which returns you to Program Manager. (See Note below.)

Close the Send Note Window to return the computer to normal operation.

NOTE: Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 does not include a spelling
checker. If you are a Windows for Workgroups Mail user and you have the File
Manager maximized, you will have to reboot your machine to continue.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
