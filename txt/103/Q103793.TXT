KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Opening numerous forms in version 1.0 of Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer can
cause the following error:

   MEFLIB.DLL: The application could not be executed.
   Insufficient memory to start the application.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows uses a window handle for each control that
exists on a form. Therefore, this count and the occurrence of this error are
affected by which forms are open, how many controls are on each form, and the
number of other applications running.

RESOLUTION
==========

In addition to closing other applications, you can sometimes reduce the number
of controls that exist on the forms.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 1.0 of Microsoft
Electronic Forms Designer. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
