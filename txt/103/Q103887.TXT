SUMMARY
=======

PASSWORD ENCRYPTION
-------------------

The only presentation layer functionality currently implemented in Microsoft
networks is the password encryption function provided by the redirector and
supported by the server service.

Microsoft network systems provide resource protection by means of an elaborate
security subsystem. Users must provide identification and receive authentication
before being granted access to protected resources. An account is created for
each network user in the server's user accounts database. The administrator
specifies a password and other logon restrictions, based on security policy, for
each account created.

In concert with the server service, the redirector's double encryption mechanism
ensures that whenever password verification is required--at logon and each time
the user requests a connection to a new server--no actual password information
is transmitted on the network.
