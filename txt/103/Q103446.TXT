TITLE   :PC Adm: .CAL and .MMF Files Not Counted in Storage Status
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, the ADMIN.EXE
program's Local-Admin, Storage, Status command returns the amount of disk space
used by the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS, and Macintosh workstation
users only. Mail Message Files (.MMF files) stored on the postoffice by users of
Microsoft Mail for Windows are not counted, nor are Microsoft Schedule+ for
Windows calendar (.CAL) files.

The Mail version 3.2 "Administrator's Guide" is misleading regarding this
topic--the bottom of page 108 implies that if the .MMF and .CAL files are stored
on the postoffice, they will be included. However, even if the .MMF and .CAL
files are on the postoffice, they still are not counted.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0 and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To calculate an accurate count of all client and Schedule+ files:

1. From the Admin program, select the Local-Admin, Storage, Status command and
   record the Total Space Used amount.

2. Quit the Admin program.

3. At the MS-DOS prompt, switch to the drive containing the postoffice database.

4. Change to the MMF directory.

5. Type DIR and record the amount.

6. Change to the CAL directory.

7. Type DIR and record the amount.

8. Add the three amounts.


Additional query words: 3.00 3.20 admin
