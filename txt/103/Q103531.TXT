TITLE   :DoubleSpace Reports ScanDisk Found Disk Errors (Low Memory)
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to compress or uncompress a disk with DoubleSpace, you may receive
the following error message when the actual problem is low memory:

   ScanDisk has detected errors on drive C. Before you can
   compress this drive, you must quit DoubleSpace and
   then fix the errors by typing SCANDISK /S C: at the
   command prompt.

CAUSE
=====

ScanDisk returns exit code 2 (insufficient memory) when it runs out of memory
during the system checks. However, when DoubleSpace receives exit code 2 from
ScanDisk, it returns the error message noted above. When you run ScanDisk with
the command line from the error message, ScanDisk correctly displays one of the
following error messages.

If there is not enough space to analyze a Doublespace-compressed drive:

   There is not enough free conventional memory to check a DoubleSpace drive.

   To run optimally, ScanDisk needs at least 400,814 bytes of conventional
   memory.

If there is not enough memory to analyze a uncompressed or host drive:

   There is not enough free conventional memory to check a drive.

   To run optimally, ScanDisk needs at least 367,022 bytes of conventional
   memory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, increase your available conventional memory. For
more information, see Chapter 6, "Making More Memory Available" in the "User's
Guide."
