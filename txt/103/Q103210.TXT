SUMMARY
=======

This is a companion article to "Designing DLLs for Multiple Client Applications,
Part 1: Strategy," also available on the Microsoft Developer Network CD. That
article discusses various strategies for allowing Microsoft Windows dynamic-link
libraries (DLLs) to provide services to multiple client applications.

This article describes how the associated Grocery Shopper sample application
implements some of the client-server strategies described in Part 1. It begins
with an overview of the sample application's architecture, and then proceeds to
analyze how the application programming interface (API) is implemented, how the
DLL manages multiple clients, and how information hiding is enforced. Among the
features of the sample code are registration and deregistration APIs,
enumeration callbacks, delayed resource allocation, and custom
event-notification messages.
