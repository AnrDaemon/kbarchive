SUMMARY

SoundCli: Demonstrates DDE Client Over Network

SoundCli is a companion sample application for the "Network DDE and Multimedia
Combine to Let You Talk to Your Peers" technical article on the Microsoft(R)
Developer Network CD. Two sample applications accompany this article: SoundSrv,
a Visual Basic(TM) application, demonstrates the internal sounds of the server,
and SoundCli, a dynamic data exchange (DDE) client application, enables a WAVE
file or live sound to be sent over a network via DDE to a remote machine running
the sound server.

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

The client application (SoundCli) allows you to open WAVE files and play them on
the local machine or on a remote machine. It also allows you to send whatever
sound input is available on the local machine to the remote machine. For
example, if you have a microphone connected to the machine running the client,
you can talk live to the remote machine running the server.

The SoundCli application was constructed using the W16APP sample available on the
Developer Network CD (Sample Code, Technical Article Samples, Misc. Samples).

To play with the samples, you will need two machines equipped with sound cards
running Microsoft Windows(TM) for Workgroups and connected to a network.

SoundCli was built and tested under Microsoft Windows version 3.1 and Microsoft
Visual Basic version 2.0.
