TITLE   :Spelling of Administrator Account Changes

The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you join a domain whose domain controller uses a different language, the
spelling of your administrator account changes. For example: If you have a
French domain controller, the default administrator account is spelled
"administrateur." If you join this domain from a Spanish backup domain
controller as an administrator, you will not be able to use the Spanish
spelling, "administrador."

CAUSE
=====

When a backup domain controller joins a domain, it receives a copy of the
security accounts manager (SAM) database from the domain controller. This
includes the spelling of the administrator account.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are two ways you can work around this behavior. You can create
administrative accounts on the domain for all the different spellings of
administrator. Or, you can add the necessary user accounts to the domain
Administrators group and not worry about the spelling of administrator.
