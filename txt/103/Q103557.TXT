======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Versions of HIMEM.SYS earlier than 3.10 may not recognize more than 64 megabytes
(MB) of memory on EISA bus computers.

CAUSE
=====

This is because HIMEM.SYS does not recognize EISA memory blocks that start
between 64 MB and 65 MB. On these machines, HIMEM.SYS only sees 64 MB of
memory.

NOTE: MS-DOS 6.2 and Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 provide HIMEM.SYS
version 3.10.

Additional query words: 6.0 5.0 5.00 5.00a 3.1
