TITLE   :Network Trash Folder While Running SFM
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1 4.0

KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a Windows NT Advanced Server running Services for Macintosh (SFM)
creates a Macintosh volume, SFM automatically creates a Network Trash
Folder directory in the new Macintosh volume. This Network Trash Folder is
required in SFM, and should not be removed.

The Network Trash Folder is used to temporarily store files in a Macintosh
volume that a user has thrown in the Trash. When the user empties the
Trash, the file will actually be deleted.

The Network Trash Folder cannot be removed while SFM is running.

The default Macintosh permissions may not be changed. Any changes you
attempt will not take affect as long as SFM is running.

If SFM is stopped, the Network Trash Folder will be removed. It will be
replaced when you reboot your computer. (SFM may be shut off in the
Services Control Panel by stopping the File Server For Macintosh service.)

NOTE: There is no Network Trash Folder in the MS UAM Volume, which is
created by default when SFM is installed on an NTFS volume.
