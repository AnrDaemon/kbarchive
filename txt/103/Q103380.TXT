The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

With version 1.0 of Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, if the electronic forms
(E-forms) are to be shared among multiple users on a Novell NetWare local area
network (LAN), the Microsoft Mail shared extensions directory must have File
Scan rights so Microsoft Mail and the E-form Browser can access the SHARED.INI
and E-form files.

When you install E-forms on a NetWare LAN, you may want to locate the shared
extensions directory in a subdirectory of the MAILEXE directory where the
Microsoft Mail executable files are installed, because the MAILEXE directory
must have File Scan set to on.
