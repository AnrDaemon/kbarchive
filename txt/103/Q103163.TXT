SUMMARY
=======

When you use Microsoft Word version 2.0 or 2.0a for Windows, in conjunction with
version 3.0 or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the Word Send option (from the
File menu) will send the document as an attachment in icon form. If you use Word
2.0b or 2.0c for Windows, the Send option will send the document as unformatted
text in the body of the mail message.

Word versions 2.0 and 2.0a use a macro to send mail messages as an attachment in
icon form. Word versions 2.0b and later are MAPI aware applications and, for
purposes of sending attachments, make calls to the Mail application programming
interface (API). The Word document is not sent as an icon; it is converted to
ASCII text and is sent as unformatted text in the body of the mail message. This
is the default setting for Word 2.0b and later.

To change the default setting and enable you to send mail messages as an
attachment in icon form, do the following:

1. From the Microsoft Word Tools menu, choose Options.

2. Select General.

3. Under Settings, Select the Send Mail As Attachment check box.

Making this selection will force Word to send the document to Mail as an
attachment in icon form, thus retaining the document's original formatting.
