TITLE   :NetBEUI Trapping in DrainLink Function
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

A trap D occurs in NetBEUI's DrainLink function identified by CSLIM = 8A1E and
IP = 5D52 on the trap screen. This problem has been seen on both Ethernet and
token ring networks.

CAUSE
=====

These are relatively infrequent errors--seen only on networks with a variety of
hardware problems--indicating that NetBEUI disabled interrupts during a portion
of its code requiring critical data handling, or that it restored registers
improperly during unusual interrupt routines.

RESOLUTION
==========

Fixes for this and other DrainLink problems were included in the Lan Manager
2.2b Patch.

Additional query words: 2.20 2.2
