TITLE   :RAS Password Authentication Failed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT Remote Access Clients cannot be validated if the password contains
extended characters. Extended characters have ASCII codes above 128.

CAUSE
=====

If your Windows NT RAS client password contains any Extended characters, RAS
client authentication will not properly convert their case (that is, uppercase
versus lowercase). This will cause Windows NT RAS authentication to fail. It
works fine for characters "a-z" and "A-Z."

RESOLUTION
==========

Until a bug fix is released, do not use extended characters in your Windows NT
passwords. This is especially true for Remote Access and Services for
Macintosh.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem was corrected in the latest U.S.
Service Pack for Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
