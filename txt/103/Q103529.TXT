TITLE   :FORMAT Overwrites Compressed Volume File on Floppy Disk
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

When you format a floppy disk, DoubleSpace may fail to give you the following
error message:

   You must use "DBLSPACE /FORMAT <drive>:" to format that drive

As a result, you have a freshly formatted non-DoubleSpace-compressed disk.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if you access an uncompressed floppy disk (for example, DIR
A:), remove the uncompressed floppy, insert a compressed floppy, and attempt to
format it. In this situation, the DoubleSpace Automount code is never called,
and the DoubleSpace-compressed floppy disk is not mounted.

NOTE: This problem may also occur if the Automount feature has been disabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you have already formatted a DoubleSpace-compressed floppy disk, recompress
the disk with the DBLSPACE /COMPRESS command.

To prevent this problem, access the DoubleSpace-compressed floppy disks before
formatting them. For example, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt,
pressing ENTER after each line:

   " a:
   format a:" (without the quotation marks)


Additional query words: 6.20 auto mount auto-mount dblspace double space
