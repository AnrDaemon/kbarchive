PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro

KEYWORDS:kbvfp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6x 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

REGION.BMP cannot be embedded or linked as a Paintbrush object in a general
field, and it cannot be printed in a FoxPro for Windows report using the Picture
tool.

MORE INFORMATION
================

REGION.BMP is of a different format than the other bitmap files that are
included in FoxPro's TUTORIAL and GOODIES subdirectories. For example, when you
attempt to open this file in Paintbrush, the following error message appears:

   The format of this file is not supported.

Therefore, when you attempt to link or embed REGION.BMP as a Paintbrush object in
a general field in FoxPro 2.x, the "Error creating OLE object" message appears.
In Visual FoxPro, the error message "OLE error code 0x800401fe : Application was
launched but didn't register a class factory" appears.

There are three different types of .BMP files: OS/2, RGB, and RLE. Paintbrush
supports the OS/2 and RGB formats but not RLE-encoded .BMP files.

Using the Report Writer Picture tool, you can place REGION.BMP on a report and
view it in page preview; however, a blank space will appear on the printed
output where the bitmap should be.
