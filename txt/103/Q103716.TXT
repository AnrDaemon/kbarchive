SUMMARY
=======

When stepping over the last curly brace "}" of main, WinMain, or LibMain, the
message box

   There is no source line debugging information

appears and prompts for an OK. This indicates that the debugging session is still
active and that there is no source code available for the remaining executable
statements.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is an expected behavior of the integrated debugger. To terminate the
debugging session, press F5 (GO). This results in the message box:

   Process <X> terminated, exit code <X> (X).

Pressing ALT+F5 to stop the debugging session also works. However, using ALT+F5
is not recommended because this method completely stops the debugger. The
program's exit code is not executed and other resources may not be freed.

It is possible to step past the closing curly brace by switching to mixed source
and assembly mode. Press CTRL+F7 or select the View menu and Choose Mixed
Source/Asm. This enables you to step into the assembly code for the exit code.
The exit code terminates the program and is executed by the run-time library
after all the executable statements in a program are completed. When the final
line of assembly code is reached, the above message will appear.
