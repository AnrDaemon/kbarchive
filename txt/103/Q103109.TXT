SUMMARY
=======

After installing SQL Server for Windows NT, additional object and counter
choices are available in the Windows NT Performance Monitor. The additional
items are:

 - SQLServer

 - SQLServer-Locks

 - SQLServer-Log

 - SQLServer-Users

Each of these four objects has multiple counters that can be selected for
monitoring.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The objects and counters for which Performance Monitor provides monitoring can
be found in the Registry under the following subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\ Perflib\009
   under the counters string.

When SQL Server for Windows NT is installed, the counters string is appended to
include the objects and counters associated with SQL Server for Windows NT. The
last entry in the counters string before installing SQL Server for Windows NT
is:

   822
   Pages Input/sec

After installing SQL Server for Windows NT, the last entry in the counters string
is:

   916
   Log Space Used(%)

Also changed in the Perflib subkey are the values for "LastCounter" and
"LastHelp," which are equal to the hexadecimal value of the last entry of the
"Counters" and "Help" strings, respectively, under the 009 subkey.
