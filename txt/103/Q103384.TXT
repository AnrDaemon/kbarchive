The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows provides no way to accept
incoming calls from the External Mail program. Windows Remote users can only be
set up as Request and not as Call/Request.

Versions of the Mail Remote client earlier than version 3.2 support the use of
the Listen program. The Listen program is a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)
program that allows the user's machine to interrogate the phone line for
incoming mail from the External Mail program while the user operates other
programs on his or her machine. In this case, the Mail administrator would set
up the user to be a Call/Request user (this procedure is explained in Chapter 10
of the Microsoft Mail version 3.2 "Administrator's Guide").

In the Mail Remote for Windows client, the Listen program is no longer supported
because of the nature of the interaction between Windows and most TSR programs.
The user therefore cannot be set up as a Call/Request user because there is no
way for Mail Remote for Windows to receive the calls.
