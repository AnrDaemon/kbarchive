The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22

You can use the /Y parameter with MS-DOS 6.2 COMMAND.COM to interactively
process any batch file. (The /Y parameter is ON by default for AUTOEXEC.BAT
when performing an interactive boot). The following list includes some of
the behaviors that using the /Y parameter produces:

 - If you have ECHO ON, each line is displayed twice. To avoid this, add ECHO
   OFF as the first line of your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and press Y when you are
   prompted to process that line.

 - When a batch file line is displayed for prompting, replaceable parameters
   (%1, %2, and so forth) and environment variables are already replaced with
   their values. This can be useful for debugging batch files.

 - You can easily prompt for user input without using the CHOICE command. For
   example, if a batch file includes "command /y /c scandisk /all," you are
   prompted with "scandisk /all (Y/N)?"
