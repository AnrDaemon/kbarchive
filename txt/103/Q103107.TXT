SYMPTOMS
========

Quark XPress for Windows, version 3.12 does not print correctly under Windows NT
and Windows NT Advanced Server. When a job prints, it is unreadable. The output
sheet is gray with a thin white margin on all four edges of the paper. This
problem was verified on a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 4 Si PostScript printer.

CAUSE
=====

Quark XPress for Windows does not work correctly with the Windows NT PostScript
printer driver version 3.1. Quark XPress requires use of a PostScript printer;
therefore, this problem cannot be avoided.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
