-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft provides a replacement for the gateway-put executable files that are
included with version 3.0 of the Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit: File
Format API (FFAPI) for Gateways and Applications.

For complete information about obtaining and installing the gateway-put files,
see the following sections:

 - To download the updated files

 - To update your FFAPI executable files

MORE INFORMATION
================

This update contains GTWPUT.EXE, OGTWPUT.EXE, and LGTWPUT.EXE, which replace the
gateway-put executable files that are included with version 3.0 of the Microsoft
Mail Software Development Kit: File Format Application Programming Interface
(FFAPI) for Gateways and Applications. These replacement files correct the
following problems:

 - The To: line is left blank when the message header is viewed from the Inbox
   summary.

 - Using LGTWPUT after EDIT.COM may corrupt the From: field of incoming
   messages.

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

After you download GWPUT.EXE to a clean directory, run it (by typing "gwput"
(without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt) to extract the contents of
the file. You should receive the following files:

   LGTWPUT EXE (100,229 bytes, dated 12-02-94, 4:01 P.M.)
   GTWPUT EXE (66,751 bytes, dated 03-09-93, 12:35 P.M.)
   OGTWPUT EXE (88,341 bytes, dated 04-30-93, 2:53 P.M.)

To update your FFAPI executable files
-------------------------------------

At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

   " copy <path>:\*.exe <destination> " (without the quotation
   marks)

where <path> is the drive and directory where you ran the self- extracting
GWPUT.EXE file and <destination> is the drive and directory where your
FFAPI executable files currently reside. For example, if you ran the
self-extracting file from the TEST directory on drive D and your FFAPI
executable files are located in the MAILEXE subdirectory on drive C, type the
following command:

   " copy d:\test\*.exe c:\mailexe " (without the quotation marks)

NOTE: Mail does not require that the FFAPI executable files be located in the
MAILEXE directory. Also, the FFAPI executable files can be part of a third-party
application. Make sure you check with the application developer before you
update copies of the FFAPI executable files.
