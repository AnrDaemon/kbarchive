======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft LINK for Windows NT, versions 1.0, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The 32-bit LINK.EXE provided with Visual C++ for Windows NT is similar to the
LINK32.EXE utility provided with the Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit
for Windows NT. Although LINK and LINK32 have many common options, there are a
few differences to be aware of when converting a build from LINK32 to LINK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following options are unique to LINK and are invalid for LINK32:

   /COMMENT
   /DEF
   /DEFAULTLIB
   /EXPORT
   /IMPLIB
   /NODEFAULTLIB
   /NOLOGO
   /OPT
   /WARN

The following LINK32 options are invalid for LINK:

   /GPSIZE
   /HEAP
   /IGNORE
   /ROM
   /STRICT

LINK uses the environment variables described in "LINK Environment Variables" on
page 80 of the "Build Tools User's Guide." LINK32 uses only the LIB environment
variables.

The map files produced by each linker have different formats.

For further information on differences between the Visual C++ for NT linker and
other linkers, refer to the section on a "A Comparison of LINK to Other Linkers"
on page 75-77 of the "Build Tools Users Guide."
