KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for
commands and file names.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Due to the design of DoubleSpace, you cannot create new compressed
drives on removable media such as floppy disks, optical drives with
removable disks (called floptical drives), and Bernoulli disks.

If you try to create a new compressed drive on a removable medium, you
receive the following error message:

   Drive <drive letter> is removable, so you cannot create a compressed
   drive on it.

You can, however, compress the existing data by running the
DoubleSpace maintenance program and choosing Existing Drive from the
Compress menu. You can also type "dblspace /compress <drive letter>" (without the quotation marks)
at the MS-DOS command prompt and then
press ENTER.

MS-DOS 6.0 DoubleSpace incorrectly allows you to create new compressed
drives on Bernoulli disks. This problem was corrected in MS-DOS 6.2.
