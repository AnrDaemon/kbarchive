-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows 1993 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Going to a topic from Find will take you to the beginning of the topic and not
to the location of the keyword in the topic. You must scroll through the topic
to find the highlighted keyword used in the Find box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Bookshelf 1991 and 1992 use Search instead of Find. Search will give a list of
topics that contain the search keyword. If you select the topic from the Topics
Found list, Bookshelf 1991 and 1992 display the topic at the location of the
keyword.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. From the Tools menu or the tool box, choose Find and enter the text string
   for which you are searching.

2. From the Topics Found dialog box, select a topic and choose Go To.

3. Move the Topics Found dialog box so the topic is visible. Do not close Topics
   Found or the keyword will no longer be highlighted.

Bookshelf 1993 will display the beginning of the topic regardless of the location
of the keyword found in the topic.
