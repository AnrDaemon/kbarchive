TITLE   :Missing Network Printers on Macintosh Choosers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While running Windows NT Advanced Server with Services for Macintosh
(SFM) installed, network printers may disappear from the Chooser on
the Macintosh client.

If you use a printer such as the Apple Laserwriter on the network and
then capture it with the Windows NT Advanced Server computer, it will
no longer show up in Chooser. Capturing a printer changes the printer
type from Apple Laserwriter to the name of the Windows NT Advanced
Server computer. For this reason, the Chooser no longer recognizes the
printer as a valid printer type.

NOTE: It is normally recommended for the printer to be captured by the
Windows NT Advanced Server. Consult the Services for Macintosh manual
for additional information.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start Print Manager on the Windows NT Advanced Server computer.

2. Choose Create Printer from the Printer menu.

3. Give the printer a name and select the Apple Laserwriter II driver.

4. In the Print To dialog box, choose Network Printer.

5. Select Appletalk Printing Devices in the Available Print Destination dialog
   box.

6. Open an Appletalk Zone that contains a printer.

7. Select a printer and choose OK.

A dialog box appears, asking if you want to capture the printer. If
you choose Yes, the printer will disappear from the Chooser on the
Macintosh computer and reappear as the name of the Windows NT Advanced
Server computer.

NOTE: The printer will not disappear or reappear immediately. It may
take a few minutes for Chooser to update itself.

To prevent this from happening, after you capture the printer with
Windows NT Advanced Server, immediately share the printer on the
network. In Print Manager, select the Apple Laserwriter printer and
choose Properties from the Printer menu. Choose the Share This Printer
on the Network box. Give the printer a share name. Now the printer
should reappear in the Chooser application.
