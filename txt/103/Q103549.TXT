The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the DBLSPACE /HOST command to change your DoubleSpace host drive
letter, you may receive the following message

   The drive letter <X> is not available for DoubleSpace's use.

where <X> is the drive letter you specified.

CAUSE
=====

You receive the previous message when:

 - The letter you specify for the new host drive is in use by an existing
   physical drive or DoubleSpace drive.

-or-

 - The drive letter you specified is greater than the LastDrive= entry in the
   DBLSPACE.INI file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To determine which drives are currently in use on your system, type "dblspace
/list" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt, and then
press ENTER.

To specify a drive letter greater than the LastDrive= entry in the DBLSPACE.INI
file:

1. Use the DBLSPACE /LASTDRIVE command to increase LastDrive= entry in the
   DBLSPACE.INI file. For example, type "dblspace /lastdrive=j" (without the
   quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

2. Restart your computer.

3. Use the DBLSPACE /HOST command to change your DoubleSpace host drive letter.
   For example, if your DoubleSpace-compressed drive is drive C and you want to
   change your host drive to drive I, type the following at the MS-DOS command
   prompt and then press ENTER:

   " dblspace c: /host=i: " (without the quotation marks)

4. Restart your computer.
