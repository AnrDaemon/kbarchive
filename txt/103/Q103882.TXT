The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The network application programmer interface (API) is provided to
allow applications to access and control network resources
programmatically, and to communicate between processes running on
different stations.

EXAMPLES
--------

 - NetUseAdd: redirects a local device identifier to a shared network resource.

 - NetShareAdd: shares a server resource.

 - NetWkstaSetUID2: logs on to the network.

 - NetServerEnum2: obtains a list of all servers of specified type(s) that are
   active in specified domain(s).

 - DosMakeNmPipe: creates a "named pipe"--a two-way inter-process communication
   device that can be used to communicate directly from a process on one station
   to a process on another without using the file system.

Most network API calls go directly to the redirector. Some (such as
NetUseAdd) go to MS-DOS by way of interrupt x21, which may, in turn,
pass the request to the redirector.

The redirector resolves some API calls (such as NetServerEnum2)
locally, without having to access the network. For other API calls
(such as NetUseAdd and NetWkstaSetUID2) the redirector uses the server
message block (SMB) protocol to communicate with remote stations in
order to effect resolution.
