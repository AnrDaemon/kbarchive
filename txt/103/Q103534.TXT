The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you run MS-DOS 6 CHKDSK on a DoubleSpace-compressed drive, it runs DBLSPACE
with the /CHKDSK parameter. MS-DOS 6.2 CHKDSK does not do this (by design).

To check the integrity of your MS-DOS 6.2 DoubleSpace-compressed drive, run
ScanDisk.

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

Additional query words: 6.20 spawn spawns
