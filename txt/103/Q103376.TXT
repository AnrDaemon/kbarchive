The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1

Following are two issues concerning the administration of a domain
containing both Windows NT Advanced Server and OS/2 servers.

RAS Administration
------------------

If you add a Windows NT Advanced Server computer to an existing
Microsoft LAN Manager OS/2 domain with an OS/2 RAS server,
administrators will no longer be able to administrate RAS from the
OS/2 server or from any other OS/2 system. All RAS administration must
be performed remotely, from a Windows NT computer (using RAS
Administrator).

Changing Administrative Passwords
---------------------------------

If you have an administrative account and want to change the password,
make sure you use a Windows NT computer. If you change your password
on an OS/2 machine, your administrative rights will be lost.
