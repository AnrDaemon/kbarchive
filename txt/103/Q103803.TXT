The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The version 3.2 Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 Administrator program
(X400ADM.EXE) requires at least 400K of conventional memory on the machine that
is used to run it.

To determine the largest executable program size that can be run, use the
Microsoft MS-DOS MEM command.

For additional information about maximizing conventional memory, consult your
MS-DOS and network operating system documentation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

One way to run the utility more efficiently is to move it to a local hard disk
drive, and then start the program from that drive. The Gateway Administrator
program must run on a machine with FAT partitions.

Create a directory on your local hard disk, and then copy these executables into
that directory:

   X400ADM.EXE
   ADM2.EXE
   X400CMAP.EXE
   X400DMAP.EXE
   PRINTCFG.EXE
   X400ADM.HLP

These files should be located in the path you specify for the executables
directory during installation of the gateway component.
