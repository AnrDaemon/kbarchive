SUMMARY
=======

Under Windows NT, you can modify the USERDEF hive so that all newly created
users inherit certain settings. Anything that can be defined or modified in
HKEY_CURRENT_USER can also be set in the USERDEF hive (for example, colors,
screen savers, program groups, sounds, and cursors).

MORE INFORMATION
================

To view or modify the USERDEF hive, do the following:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor by choosing Run from the File menu of Program Manager,
   typing "regedt32" (without the quotation marks), and pressing ENTER.

2. Select the "HKEY_USERS on Local Machine" window.

3. From the Registry menu, choose Load Hive.

4. From the C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\CONFIG (or equivalent) directory, select the
   USERDEF file.

5. In the Key Name field, type "USERDEF" (without the quotation marks).

6. Modify the USERDEF subkeys as desired.

7. From the Registry menu, choose Unload Hive, and choose the Yes button.

8. Quit Registry Editor.

Now when you create a new user from User Manager, the new user's hive will
contain the modified information.
