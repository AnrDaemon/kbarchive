If you have a Diamond video card, you may notice that there are no
Diamond video drivers listed in Windows NT Setup even though several
Diamond adapters are listed on the hardware compatibility list. This
is because the video drivers are based on the chip set, not the
particular adapter. This is also true for other video adapters. The
following is a table of Diamond adapters and their drivers by chip
set:
