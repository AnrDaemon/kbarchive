SUMMARY
=======

NETWORK COMMANDS, UTILITIES AND SERVICES
----------------------------------------

Microsoft network operating systems, such as LAN Manager, include several
commands, utilities, and services.

 - Commands and utilities, such as the NET USE command and the full-screen NET
   ADMIN utility make it easy for end users to access and control network
   resources.

 - Services. The server service allows a station to make its resources, such as
   disks and printers, available to users on other stations. The messenger
   service allows a user to exchange small messages with other network users.

Network commands, utilities and services use network application programmer
interface (API) calls to communicate, through the local redirector, with remote
stations.
