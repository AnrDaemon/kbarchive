TITLE   :PC Gen: 3Com XNS and Mail May Cause Computer to Hang
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, the computer
may stop responding (hang) when it is left unattended. This problem can occur if
you are using a slower computer (8088/80286) with a slower 3Com network card
(such as an 8-bit 3Com 3C503 or 3C505), over a 3Com XNS-based network.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a known XNS timer interrupt chaining problem. The
computer will hang if you have numerous timing related events running
simultaneously (for example, the 3C503 driver, the LAN Manager redirector, Mail
polling, Word autosaving, and 3Com XNS).

RESOLUTION
==========

Possible solutions are to use a configuration that minimizes the amount of
time-related events. Examples include:

 - Making the polling of the client/External less frequent

 - Using a 16-bit network card (3C507)

 - Making sure the interrupt setting of the network card is set to the lowest
   value possible (for example, 2 or 3, rather than 11 or 12; the lower the IRQ
   value, the higher the priority to your card).

STATUS
======

3Com has confirmed this to be a problem in 3Com XNS. 3Com is researching this
problem; Microsoft will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.

3Com XNS is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
