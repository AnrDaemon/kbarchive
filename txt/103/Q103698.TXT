SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows File Manager is unable to make any modifications (rename,
change attributes, delete, move, and so forth) to a file or directory name that
has a question mark (?) as the first character.

NOTE: Microsoft Undelete for Windows, which ships with MS-DOS 6.0 inserts a
question mark for the first letter of an undeleted file if no letter is given.
This problem was corrected in MS-DOS version 6.2 and later.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can rename or delete these files from an MS-DOS command prompt in Windows.
(For more information on the REN and DEL commands, refer to your "Microsoft
MS-DOS User's Guide.")

If you use Microsoft Undelete for Windows and a directory name has a ? as the
first character, do one of the following:

 - Use a third-party disk editor to rename the directory.

 - Format the drive to remove the directory name.

 - Run the ScanDisk utility (which ships with MS-DOS 6.2). ScanDisk locates
   these directory names and makes them valid directories when all is complete.
