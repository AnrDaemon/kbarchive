TITLE   :System Hangs When SCSI Driver Is Loaded After DBLSPACE.SYS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

SCSI device drivers loaded high or loaded after MS-DOS 6.2 DBLSPACE.SYS in the
CONFIG.SYS file may cause the system to stop responding (hang).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, load your SCSI device driver before DBLSPACE.SYS in
the CONFIG.SYS file. If your system still hangs, load the device driver low
(that is, change "DEVICEHIGH=" to "DEVICE=" and remove the /L parameter). For
example, change

   devicehigh /L:1,1234 =c:\scsi.sys

   to:

   device=c:\scsi.sys
