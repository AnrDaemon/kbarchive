TITLE   :Cannot Manually Mount Fragmented DoubleSpace-Compressed Drive
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

If DoubleSpace cannot mount a compressed volume file (CVF) at startup because
the CVF is too fragmented, DoubleSpace increases the MaxFileFragments setting in
the DBLSPACE.INI file and restarts your computer.

However, when you try to manually mount a DoubleSpace-compressed drive (from the
command line or using the DoubleSpace maintenance program), DoubleSpace does not
mount the CVF if it is too fragmented.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this situation, use the DBLSPACE /MAXFILEFRAGMENTS command to
increase the MaxFileFragments setting in your DBLSPACE.INI file. To do this:

1. Use the TYPE command to view the current DBLSPACE.INI settings. For example:

   type h:\dblspace.ini

   NOTE: The DBLSPACE.INI file is hidden in the root directory of the host drive.
   To find the host drive for your DoubleSpace-compressed drive, type "dblspace
   /list" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then
   press ENTER.

2. Increase the MaxFileFragments setting by at least 1000. For example, if the
   current setting is 1000, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt, and
   then press ENTER:

   " dblspace /maxfilefragments=2000" (without the quotation marks)

3. Press CTRL+ALT+DEL to restart your computer.
