TITLE   :PC Win: Mail Will Not Start Minimized from Word Macro
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot use a Microsoft Word for Windows macro to start version 3.0, 3.0b, or
3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows minimized with the Shell command. For example,
when you use the following query, Mail launches, but it is not minimized.

   shell "c:\msmail\msmail.exe", 0

CAUSE
=====

To find out if it should launch minimized, Mail checks for the flag
SW_SHOWMINNOACTIVE, which is ordinal 7. However, the Word for Windows Shell
command only passes ordinals 0 to 4 to another application. The Shell command
passing out a 0 is equivalent to sending the flag SW_SHOWMINIMIZED, but Mail
does not check that flag.

Mail should check SW_SHOWMINIMIZED instead of (or in addition to)
SW_SHOWMINNOACTIVE.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.


Additional query words: 3.00 3.00b 3.20
