OVERVIEW: INTERRUPT 21 HOOK OPTIMIZATION

In Microsoft LAN Manager version 2.1, an important performance
optimization was implemented in the DOS redirector--the Interrupt 21
Hook. The redirector initialization software registers a handler at
interrupt x21. Since the redirector loads after MS-DOS, the redirector
handler gets control, before MS-DOS, when interrupt x21 is called.

When an application wants to read from or write to a file, it loads
selected CPU registers with information such as:

 - the file handle

 - the number of bytes to read/write

 - a pointer to a buffer that will accept the data to be read

 - a pointer to a buffer that contains the data to be written

The application then passes the read/write request to MS-DOS by
calling interrupt x21 with the appropriate function number.

Before the Int 21 Hook
----------------------

The request is processed by MS-DOS. If the handle for the specified
file has been designated as "remote," MS-DOS passes the read/write
request to the redirector.

With the Int 21 Hook
--------------------

The request goes directly to the redirector, which quickly determines
whether the request is a repeated sequential read or write. If so, the
redirector handles the request immediately. If not, the redirector
passes control to the next registered interrupt x21 handler, and
MS-DOS gets control. MS-DOS performs its standard check to determine
if the request is local or remote. If remote, MS-DOS passes the
request back to the redirector.
