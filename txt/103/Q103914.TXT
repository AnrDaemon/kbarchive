KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Windows or Windows for Workgroups and use an Adaptec 1542c
bus-mastering SCSI hard disk controller, you may receive the following error
message:

   Cannot write to drive C:

CAUSE
=====

The Adaptec 1542c controller does not need a device driver to function correctly
in most circumstances. However, on some hardware, it cannot perform necessary
functions (such as double buffering for direct memory access) without a device
driver.

WORKAROUND
==========

According to Adaptec Technical Support, a possible workaround is to use
ASPI4DOS.SYS, which is normally used only with the 1542b SCSI controller. Load
this driver in the CONFIG.SYS file as follows:

   DEVICE=C:\DOS\ASPI4DOS.SYS

This line assists the controller in performing its functions.


MORE INFORMATION
================

You can obtain ASPI4DOS.SYS from the Adaptec bulletin board service or Adaptec
Technical Support.

The Adaptec 1542c Controller is manufactured by Adaptec, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
