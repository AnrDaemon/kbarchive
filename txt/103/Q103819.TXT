TITLE   :ScanDisk Fails to Remount DoubleSpace-Compressed Drive
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

ScanDisk may report an error when mounting a compressed drive and leave the
compressed drive unmounted after ScanDisk completes its repairs.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when both the compressed drive and its host drive contain
errors, and the errors on the compressed drive prevent it from being mounted.
ScanDisk unmounts the compressed drive when it repairs the host but is unable to
remount the drive after fixing the host. When mounting the compressed drive
fails, ScanDisk checks and repairs the DBLSPACE.<nnn> file. However,
ScanDisk does not mount the DBLSPACE.<nnn> file after scanning it.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, reboot your computer.
