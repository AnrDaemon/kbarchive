The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, it
is not necessary to give Novell NetWare version 3.1x users full
trustee assignments.

The minimum NetWare trustee assignments required to access a Mail
database for users who do not have administrator privileges are as
follows:

   MAILDATA = root directory where Mail is installed

   MAILDATA [ RW ] (This is true for all subdirectories except:)

   MAILDATA\ATT [ RWCEM ]
   MAILDATA\CAL [ RWCEM F]
   MAILDATA\FOLDERS [ RWCEM ]
   MAILDATA\MAI [ RWCEM ]
   MAILDATA\MMF [ RWCEM ]

 
Although it is acceptable for the HLP, TPL, and INF subdirectories to
have only read access [R], read/write [RW] access is preferred.

Users logging in to perform administrative or External functions
should have [RWCEM] rights throughout the database.

NOTE: These rights can be given to NetWare users or Groups via Syscon,
or the Grant command. (Refer to the NetWare documentation for more
information on granting trustee assignments.)

The Novell NetWare product mentioned above is manufactured by a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
