TITLE   :PC WRmt: Cannot Create New .MMF If Old Location Unavailable
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows may return the following error
message

   Your message file could not be found

followed by:

   Open Message File

After the error message, even if you change to a different directory, Mail Remote
ignores the change to the directory and creates a new Mail message file (.MMF)
in the directory listed on the OfflineMessages line of the MSMAIL.INI file.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs only when the Mail Remote for Windows .MMF file is moved to a
floppy disk or to a network drive, and you start Mail with the floppy disk out
of the drive or with the network drive disconnected. If this occurs, it is
impossible to create a new message file from the dialog box.

Following the design of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, Mail Remote for Windows
ignores changed directories when you are in the dialog box for creating a new
message file. Because the old location is not available (due to the floppy disk
being out of the drive or the network connection missing), the error appears.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, either modify or comment out the OfflineMessages
line in the MSMAIL.INI file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
Remote for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
