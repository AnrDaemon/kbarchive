======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Windows NT Setup on a Gateway 2000 486/66V with IDE drives, certain
circumstances may cause your computer to hang.

Under Windows NT 3.1, the computer hangs when Setup reaches the Examining Disk
Configuration step. The Examining Disk Configuration step occurs immediately
before the Setup program displays disk information that allows you to select
where you want to install Windows NT.

Under Windows NT 3.5, the computer hangs when Setup reboots the system and
attempts to run in graphics mode.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem under Windows NT 3.1, change the IDE SPEED from Fast
to Normal. Changing this setting to Normal should allow you to continue the
Windows NT Setup without error.

To work around this problem under Windows NT 3.5, change the HARD DRIVE SPEED
from Fast to Standard PIO.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Gateway 2000 486/66V has a CMOS setting under the Standard System Settings
Options called IDE SPEED. The default for this setting is Fast. After Windows NT
is installed, you can change the speed back to fast.
