The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22

SUMMARY
=======

Some laptop computers may experience problems associated with using Microsoft's
MS-DOS EMM386.EXE expanded memory manager.

MORE INFORMATION
================

EMM386.EXE allows MS-DOS to simulate expanded memory on computers with a 386 or
higher microprocessor. It also allows terminate-and-stay- resident (TSR)
programs and device drivers to be loaded into the upper memory area (UMA) to
free conventional memory for MS-DOS-based applications. You may experience
problems using EMM386.EXE on certain laptop computers.

Toshiba
-------

Symptoms

Toshiba has confirmed that EMM386.EXE, included with the Microsoft MS-DOS 6 and
6.2 Retail Upgrade Package, is not compatible with the Resume mode on Toshiba
laptops.

EMM386.EXE also disables the PopUp window on Toshiba laptops. If the EMM386.EXE
driver is loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file, the FN-PopUp key combination does not
cause the PopUp window to be displayed; therefore, you may be unable to view the
current battery charge or toggle the various battery options.


Resolution

For further information concerning installing MS-DOS 6.0 on Toshiba computers,
call Toshiba Technical Support at (800) 456-8649.

CompuAdd
--------

Symptoms

After running MEMMAKER.EXE or manually adding EMM386.EXE to the CONFIG.SYS file
on a CompuAdd 325TFX or 425TFX running LAP.SYS, the computer may stop responding
(hang) on startup.

Cause

This problem occurs because the LAP.SYS driver, which loads in the CONFIG.SYS
file, uses the upper memory address range C000-CFFF.

Resolution

To correct this problem, you must exclude the C000-CFFF range by adding the
parameter X=C000-CFFF to the EMM386.EXE line in the CONFIG.SYS file. For
example:

   device=c:\dos\emm386.exe x=c000-cfff

LAP.SYS is CompuAdd's power management system program. For more information, call
CompuAdd Technical Support at (800) 999-9901.
