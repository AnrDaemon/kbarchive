TITLE   :Using CTRL+F8 to Process Configuration Files on Host Drive
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SUMMARY
=======

After you press CTRL+F8 to start your system without loading the DoubleSpace
component (DBLSPACE.BIN), you are given the option to process the configuration
files (CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT) on the host drive (if there are any).

For example, you can have configuration files on the DoubleSpace- compressed
drive C and configuration files for a different configuration (such as playing
games) on the host drive (such as H).

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you interactively boot your computer without DoubleSpace (CTRL+F8), MS- DOS
interactively processes the configuration files on drive C, which are normally
seen on the host drive H. If you are using CTRL+F8 to simply get the
configuration files processed but you don't want to step through them, press
ESC. (This basically answers yes to all additional yes/no prompts).

NOTE: Any device drivers or terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs referenced
in the configuration files on the host drive must also be located on the host
drive (or an uncompressed drive). For example, if you have a CONFIG.SYS file on
H referencing C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS, you need to create a DOS directory on the host
drive and copy HIMEM.SYS from C to H.
