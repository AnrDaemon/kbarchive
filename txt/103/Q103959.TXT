TITLE   :PC Forms: Reply from PROFS Loses Form Data
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,3.0,3.2

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a message created using version 1.0 of Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer is
sent through the PROFS gateway, replies to the message may not perform as
expected. A custom message replied through a gateway may lose the original form
data.

CAUSE
=====

If a PROFS user replies to a message that was sent using a custom form, the
recipient will not receive any of the form information. This is because the
PROFS reply to a custom message does not preserve the message class, but uses a
standard mail note.

RESOLUTION
==========

Forwarding a message from PROFS preserves the message class and the recipient
will receive a text version of the original form. Therefore, to preserve
information sent using a custom form via PROFS, it is necessary to forward the
form back to the user rather than replying.
