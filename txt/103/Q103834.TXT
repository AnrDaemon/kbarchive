-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

According to the "Commands & Functions" manual for FoxBASE+/Mac, use of the
style metacharacter (<) followed by "B", "I", "U", "O", or "S" causes a menu
to have the style that corresponds to the letter used. This information applies
only to menu options (the choices on a menu popup), not to the main menu bar. If
the style metacharacter is used with the main menu bar, the "<" and the
letter following it will be placed on the menu bar.

NOTE: The letters following the style metacharacter must be in uppercase.
