SUMMARY
=======

When a menu popup is active, the operating environment's (Windows or Macintosh)
event manager handles all events. This means that FoxPro will not be able to
"see" certain events, such as ON KEY LABEL commands, so some code transported
from FoxPro for MS-DOS may no longer work. For example, the following procedure
will cause a wait window to display in FoxPro for MS-DOS but not in FoxPro for
Windows:

1. From the Command window, issue the follow command:

   ON KEY LABEL F8 WAIT WINDOW "Hello"

2. Click any menu pad and leave the menu popup in the open state.

3. When you press F8, the wait window will not appear in FoxPro for Windows
   because the key press was intercepted by the Windows event manager, not by
   FoxPro for Windows.

Note that the same behavior occurs for user-defined menus; it is not restricted
only to the system menu.

NOTE: This behavior occurs in FoxPro for Macintosh when a menu popup is opened by
using the shortcut key combination, for example pressing COMMAND+N to open the
File, New menu dialog box.
