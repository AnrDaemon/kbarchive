======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Cinemania for Windows 1992 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Cinemania, the words on the buttons may not fit or will look corrupted if the
MS Sans Serif font is either missing, corrupt, or incorrectly substituted in the
Windows environment.

RESOLUTION 1
------------

1. Verify the MS Sans Serif font is installed in the Fonts option in Control
   Panel.

2. If it is present, make sure the sample appears uncorrupted.

   If it is missing, press the Add button and double-click the SYSTEM
   subdirectory in the WINDOWS directory and see if this font is in that
   directory. If you are using Windows 95, click on the File menu and select
   Install New Font, then double-click the SYSTEM subdirectory in the WINDOWS
   directory and see if this font is in that directory.

   If it is not in the SYSTEM subdirectory or if the sample is corrupt, install a
   new font from the Windows disks by reinstalling Windows or by decompressing
   those font files.

RESOLUTION 2
------------

1. To determine if the font is incorrectly substituted, open the WIN.INI file in
   Notepad and make sure that the following line is the only line in the [Fonts
   Substitutes] section that is referencing MS Sans Serif:

   Helv=MS Sans Serif

2. If there are any other substitutions referring to MS Sans Serif, remark them
   out and make sure the line shown above is in this section of the WIN.INI
   file.

For more information, query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

   decompress and expand and switch and w_win

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Cinemania 1992. This problem was
corrected in Cinemania 1994.
