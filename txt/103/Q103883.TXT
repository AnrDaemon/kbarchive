LOCAL I/O OPERATION

When an application requests I/O services, the underlying operating
system calls device driver software that is resident in BIOS on most
MS-DOS PCs. Device driver software is written to communicate with the
device controller card, and can thus forward the I/O request to
firmware that is resident on the controller.

The device controller then provides the required control signals to
the device.
