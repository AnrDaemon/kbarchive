The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log onto Windows NT after changing a user account from the
Administrator's group to a group other than Administrators the following error
message may appear:

   GROUP ERROR: Cannot open program group [your group]. Do you want the Program
   Manager to still try to load it in the future?

This only happens with accounts that were migrated while the user belonged to the
Administrator's group.

RESOLUTION
==========

You must delete and recreate the account in User Manager or delete that user
profile from Windows NT Setup. During the next logon the groups will migrate
again.

Reference(s):
