SYMPTOMS
========

The OnInitialUpdate() function of a CView object in a single document interface
(SDI) application may be called more than once. Any initialization that needs to
be done only when the view's window is created should be done in the OnCreate()
message handler instead of in the OnInitialUpdate() function.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In an SDI application, a single CView object is created to display a view of the
document. When the user changes the document, the data in the CDocument is
cleared using CDocument::DeleteContents(), and data for the new document is read
into the CDocument object. Then the view is updated by sending a
WM_INITIALUPDATE message to the view's window, which calls the OnInitialUpdate()
function. Therefore, every time the user changes documents, the
OnInitialUpdate() function for the view is called.
