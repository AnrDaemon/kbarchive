TITLE   :Overview: SMB Structure is Standard Vehicle for Requests
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
The redirector's primary function is to format remote requests so that
they can be understood by a remote station (such as a file server) and
send them on their way through the network.

The redirector uses the server message block (SMB) structure as the
standard vehicle for sending these requests. The SMB is also the
vehicle by which the remote station returns responses to redirector
requests.

Each SMB contains a header consisting of the command code (which
specifies the task that the redirector wants the remote station to
perform) and several environment and parameter fields (which specify
how the command is to be carried out).

In addition to the SMB header, the last field in the SMB may contain
up to 64K of data to be sent to the remote station.

SMB structure, environment, commands and associated protocols are
documented in the publications below.
