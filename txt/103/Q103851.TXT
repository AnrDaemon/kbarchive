TITLE   :PC WRmt Ext: Telebit Err Msg: Failure to Reinitialize Modem
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.1,3.0,3.2

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.2 
 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the version 3.2 Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows or versions 2.1,
3.0, or 3.2 Microsoft Mail for PC Networks EXTERNAL.EXE program with the Telebit
script, sometimes the following display appears when you reset the modem after a
successful transmission:

   Failure to initialize modem

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the response code stored in the response buffer contains
two zeros. The modem was reset correctly; however, the script did not recognize
the two zeros as being acceptable--the script was looking for only one zero to
be returned.

This error will not be consistent because sometimes the response codes are placed
separately into the response buffer. This problem is timing dependent.

RESOLUTION
==========

The lines in the script from the RESET section are:

      clearrsp          ; Clear out any ring signals
      sendln "ATV0"     ; Numeric result codes
      sendln "ATE0"     ; Suppress command local echo
      sendln "ATZ"      ; Reset modem to default settings
      waitrsp 1

To resolve this problem, place the waitrsp command after "ATE0", so that the
multiple response codes from the different sendln commands do not get included
together. The corrected RESET section should look like the following:

      clearrsp          ; Clear out any ring signals
      sendln "ATV0"     ; Numeric result codes
      sendln "ATE0"     ; Suppress command local echo
      waitrsp 1
      sendln "ATZ"      ; Reset modem to default settings
      waitrsp 1
