SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft MS-DOS 6.0 Defragmenter (Defrag) relies exclusively on conventional
memory to hold all drive file allocation table (FAT) data and the disk directory
structure.

Both MS-DOS 6.0, 6.2, and 6.21 Defrag use a 12,000-byte upper memory block (UMB)
for data storage if it is available. MS-DOS 6.2 Defrag uses up to 384 kilobytes
(K) of extended (XMS) memory, when available, to hold the FAT data for the
drive. If you receive "out of memory" errors with MS-DOS 6.2 Defrag, increase
conventional memory and/or XMS memory up to 384K.

NOTE: If /SKIPHIGH is specified, the 12,000-byte UMB and the 384K free XMS memory
are not used.

If you have 384K of XMS memory and Defrag still does not run, free more
conventional memory. If you cannot free more conventional memory by using a
memory manager (such as EMM386.EXE) or by removing optional device drivers, you
must reduce the number of files and directories on your drive to allow Defrag to
run. This requires transferring, orbacking up and removing, files from your disk
drive.
