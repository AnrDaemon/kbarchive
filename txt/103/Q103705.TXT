TITLE   :Piping LOAD Commands to NUL Causes Windows Sharing Violations
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

Users sometimes pipe network commands to NUL to shield their workstations from
network messages. But If SHARE.EXE is loaded and any LAN Manager LOAD command
has been piped to NUL before you enter Windows enhanced mode (LOAD NETBEUI >
NUL) then all subsequent piping to NUL from within Windows reports a sharing
violation.

To avoid this, refrain from piping protocol LOAD commands to NUL. It should not
pose a problem: LOAD commands return only two lines of information.
