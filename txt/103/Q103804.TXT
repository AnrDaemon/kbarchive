KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Version 1.0 of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail requires an access
component similar to that of all Microsoft Mail gateways, but it does not
require you to install any software from the Gateway Access for 3Com 3+Mail
disk.

CAUSE
=====

All the necessary access components for the gateway postoffice are installed
when you install the gateway executable files. The required components are
installed by the Install program (INSTALL.EXE) on the Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail
disk.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Usually, installing the access components of a gateway requires an additional
installation process that is performed after you install the gateway component.
On a downstream postoffice, only the access component is installed.

On the 3Com 3+Mail gateway, the Gateway Access for 3Com 3+Mail disk is used only
for a downstream postoffice (not the gateway postoffice, but another postoffice
that has direct access to the gateway postoffice).

WARNING: NEVER install the disk with the gateway access component onto the 3Com
gateway postoffice. This corrupts the database and causes you to receive
messages referring to circular routes being detected.

If you accidentally install the gateway access component, perform these steps:

1. Use the Import utility (IMPORT.EXE) to extract the 3Com names to a text file
   using the -X command-line parameter.

2. Uninstall the access component using the following command from the access
   disk:

   install -r

3. Uninstall the gateway component using the following command from the gateway
   disk:

   install -r

For more information on using the IMPORT utility, see the documentation for
IMPORT.EXE.
