KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a user tries to create a private or shared folder with version 3.0 of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation, the following error message
may be displayed:

   Notice 91 Duplicate folder name

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when the .IDX file (FOLDROOT.IDX) in the FOLDERS\PUB
subdirectory (in the case of a shared folder) or the user's 8-digit .IDX file in
the FOLDERS\LOC\<8_digit> subdirectory (in the case of a private folder)
is corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, restore the file from a backup copy. However, if a
backup copy is not available, you can run the FIXIDX utility to build the .IDX
file from the folder files. FIXIDX has a few side effects, which are outlined in
the FIXIDX.TXT file included with it.

The FIXIDX.EXE utility is available as part of the Database Maintenance Utilities
document. To obtain the document containing the Database Maintenance Utilities,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
