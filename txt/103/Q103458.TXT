SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, OS/2 workstation Setup program tries to
install a file, runs out of disk space, and displays the following message

   Problem writing <filename> file.

where <filename> is the name of file the Setup program is currently trying
to install.

After you receive the message, Setup quits. If you then try to set up the
Presentation Manager (PM) client on another drive, you may still receive the
message if the MSMAIL directory still exists on the original drive.

CAUSE
=====

SETUP.EXE begins without checking to see if there is sufficient disk space for
the Mail installation, finds there is not enough space, and quits.

RESOLUTION
==========

Delete the MSMAIL directory and either clear enough disk space on the current
drive or choose another drive with more disk space.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, OS/2 workstation. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
