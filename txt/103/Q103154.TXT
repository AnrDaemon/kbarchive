The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following error may occur in the event log when a logical link
connection (LLC) entity receives an invalid data unit:

   Nbf received an unexpected FRMR packet from a remote computer.

FRMR is the Frame Reject frame sent by the NetBEUI Frames (NBF) LLC
layer when one of the following conditions causes a data unit to
become invalid:

 - Invalid sequence number

 - Invalid presence of an information field

 - Maximum allowable length for an LLC data unit is exceeded

These errors cannot be corrected by retransmission. In response to the
FRMR frame, the workstation sends a Disconnect (DISC) command to
terminate the link connection. The workstation may then reestablish
the connection.
