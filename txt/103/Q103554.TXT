TITLE   :Running MS-DOS-Based Games with DoubleSpace

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

Some MS-DOS-based games may not display video output correctly when the
DoubleSpace component (DBLSPACE.BIN) is loaded.

CAUSE
=====

The DoubleSpace decompression code requires the buffer it is reading into to be
readable so that it can scan back for expanding repeated strings. Some games
read directly into video RAM, which is not guaranteed to be readable.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, install your MS-DOS-based games on your
uncompressed host drive. Then, when you start MS-DOS, press CTRL+F5 or CTRL+F8
when the "Starting MS-DOS" prompt is displayed to start your computer without
loading DBLSPACE.BIN.
