-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to play a musical instrument digital interface (MIDI) (.MID) or
waveform (.WAV) file using the Sound Finder, you may receive the error message

   Could not play file: <filename>

where <filename> is the name of your file.

The message may continue with:

   Not enough memory available for this task.
   Quit one or more applications to increase available memory, and then try
   again.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you are trying to play an .MID file, the cause may be a missing or corrupted
TIMER driver. Run Control Panel and open the Drivers option. If TIMER does not
exist, choose Add and install the TIMER; otherwise, remove it and reinstall the
driver from the Windows disks.

If you are trying to play a .WAV file and receive the second part of the message,
the MMTASK.TSK file found in the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory may be missing or
corrupted.
