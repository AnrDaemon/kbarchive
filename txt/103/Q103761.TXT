KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

A machine with an Adaptec 1742 controller traps when you try to continue a LAN
Manager installation after installing OS/2.

CAUSE
=====

The Adaptec 1742 controller comes with a utility that you use to build an
alternate installation disk A and install OS/2. When you finish installing OS/2
and reboot the machine to continue installing LAN Manager, the machine traps
because the alternate disk A fails to copy its BID file to C:\.

RESOLUTION
==========

Copy the BID file from the alternate disk A to C:\ before continuing to install
LAN Manager.
