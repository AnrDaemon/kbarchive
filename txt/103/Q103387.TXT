SYMPTOMS
========

Intersvr does not list the COM port(s) available for remote printing from the
Interlnk client.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you are printing remotely from the client to the Intersvr's COM1 port (using
LPT1 as the data channel), you must perform the following steps before invoking
INTERSVR and INTERLNK:

1. You MUST have an extra LPT port on the server.

2. Set COM1 parameters on the server at the command prompt. For example

   c:\>mode com1: <b>,<p>,<d>,<s>

   where <b> is the bit rate (for example, 9600 bits per second [BPS]),
   <p> is the parity (for example, none), <d> is the data bits value
   (for example, 8), and <s> is the stop bits value (for example, 1).

3. Redirect the open Intersvr LPT2 port (not being used as channel) to COM1 by
   typing the following at the server's (Intersvr) command prompt:

   c:\>mode lpt2:=com1:

4. Start up Interlnk (with Intersvr invoked) and print to the Intersvr's
   redirected LPT2 port to print on Intersvr's COM1 port.

NOTE: The above steps also apply to using a null modem cable as the data channel
and printing to the Intersvr's physical COM2 port. Your server must have two COM
ports and the LPT1 port must be redirected to the COM2 port for printing.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Many users want to use a customized parallel cable as a data access channel
between the client and server because it transfers at a rate of 8 bits compared
to customized serial null modem cable's rate of 1 bit.

You can print to another LPT port (LPT2) if you have two physical LPT ports on
the server (Intersvr), or you can print to another COM port on the server. The
Intersvr's user interface, however, only lists the LPT ports available for
printing.
