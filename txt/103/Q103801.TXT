TITLE   :FFAPI: Err Msg: 190 Automatic File Transfer Not Supported
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit (FFAPI), version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use the automatic file transfer feature (the -W parameter on the
command-line) with version 3.0 of the Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit
(Remote FFAPI), this error message is displayed:

   190 - 1 - 0 - Automatic File transfer not supported by this version of FFAPI.

CAUSE
=====

In version 3.0 of Remote FFAPI, the automatic file transfer feature is not
currently implemented, even though the "File Format API for Gateways and
Applications" manual states that it is. The -W parameter invokes the above error
message when you use the parameter with RMPGET.EXE and RMTPUT.EXE.

Pages 46, 47, 93, 95,96, and 98 of the "File Format API for Gateways and
Applications" manual incorrectly reference the automatic file transfer feature
(-W) of the Remote API.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can simulate the automatic file transfer feature in an application that can
understand and create the format used by Microsoft Mail.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can also simulate the message that results from using the automatic file
transfer feature by matching the format used by the -W parameter. You can create
this kind of message by using APPGET.EXE or RMTGET.EXE on a mail message that
used APPPUT.EXE and the -W parameter to send the message.

The message should look similar to this example:
