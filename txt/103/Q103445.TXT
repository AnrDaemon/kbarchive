TITLE   :Advanced Server Hang with Service for Macintosh
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you have installed Services for Macintosh and have the AppleTalk protocol
bound to an NE3200 compatible driver, your computer will stop responding (hang)
or be extremely slow when you start up Windows NT Advanced Server.

The following entry is recorded in your error log:

   The description  for Event ID [46] in Source [AppleTalk] could not be
   found. It contains the following insertion string(s) \device\atalkDdp.

   The Data in words is:
   0000: 00000000 005C0001 00000000 C000002E
   0010: 000A03E4 C001000D 00000000 00000000
   0020: 00000000 00000000

CAUSE
=====

One of the transports hangs during its loading sequence. The NE3200 decides that
it needs to reset because it's on a quiet network and it thinks that the card is
hung. The problem is that if a transport tries to open the adapter while the
reset is in progress, the open will be pending but does not get restarted when
the reset completes. This bug will not be exposed except on a network with very
low traffic.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem was corrected in the latest U.S.
Service Pack for Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1. For
