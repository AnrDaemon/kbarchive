TITLE   :Cannot Install Driver From a Directory Name That Has a Space
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you install additional drivers in Windows NT from the Drivers section of
Control Panel, if the required files reside in a directory with a space in its
name, the files will not be found and the driver will not be able to install
correctly.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. From File Manager, create a directory on an NTFS partition called "Directory
   Name with Spaces" (without the quotes).

2. Expand any one of the following files from the Windows NT CD-ROM to that
   directory:

   SNDSYS.SYS
   SNDSYS32.DLL
   SYNTH.DLL
   SYNTH.PAT
   SYNTH.SYS

3. Open Control Panel and choose the Drivers icon.

4. Choose Add.

5. Select the Windows Sound System driver and choose OK.

6. In the Install Driver dialog box, type the name of the NTFS directory:

   <drive:>\Directory Name with Spaces\

   where <drive:> is the drive letter of the NTFS partition.

7. Choose OK and the directory name will be truncated in the dialog box you
   entered at the first space in the name.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the files to install a specific drive need to be stored in a different place
than the Windows NT CD-ROM, place them in a directory that does not contain any
spaces in the directory name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 3.x. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

This problem is resolved in Windows NT 4.0.
