======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your second parameter in the AUTOEXEC.BAT GOTO command is not correctly
capitalized or both parameters are not enclosed in quotation marks, your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file may not be processed correctly.

CAUSE
=====

When you use multiple-configuration menus, both expressions on either side of
the double-equal sign (==) (for the GOTO command) must be enclosed in
double-quotation marks. Also, the expression on the right side of the == is case
sensitive.

RESOLUTION
==========

Ensure your GOTO command in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file uses the proper syntax (noted
above).

Additional query words: 6.22 6.20 upper lower multiple configurations
