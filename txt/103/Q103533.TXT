======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

If you copy a compressed volume file (CVF) to a DoubleSpace-compressed drive and
attempt to mount the file, you receive the following messages:

   DoubleSpace is mounting drive <letter>.
   DoubleSpace cannot mount drive <letter>.
   There is a disk error on drive <letter>. To fix it, type SCANDISK
   <letter> at the command prompt.

For example, you receive this error if you copy DBLSPACE.001 to your compressed
drive C and type "dblspace /mount=1 c:" (without the quotation marks) at the
MS-DOS command prompt. In addition, your drive C is unmounted.

CAUSE
=====

DoubleSpace is not designed to support mounting CVFs from CVFs.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Restart your computer to gain access to your compressed drive.

2. Copy the CVF from your compressed drive to an uncompressed drive.

3. Mount the CVF from the uncompressed drive.
