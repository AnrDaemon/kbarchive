Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.


The application displays a form from which the user can select a program group
name (for example, Games) and a bunch of files. Clicking on the Make Group
button either creates a new group with the specified name in the Program Manager
or opens a group by that name, if one already exists. The application then
creates program items in the group for each selected file.

Of course, the user can create groups and items manually using the Program
Manager File New command or by dragging files from the File Manager to the
Program Manager. However, as an added bonus, Mkegroup provides an Iterate button
that scans all of the subdirectories below the current directory, looking for
files that match the currently selected pattern (for example, *.EXE), and adds
all matching files to the list of selected files.

For example, let's say you have a directory called C:\VB\VBSAMPLE on your hard
disk that contains a subdirectory for each sample program you have written. If
you want to create a program group that contains program items for all of the
samples, open Mkegroup, select C:\VB\VBSAMPLE in the directory list box, and
choose the Iterate button. This is much easier than opening each subdirectory
individually.
