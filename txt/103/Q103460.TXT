The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Running the External Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE) clears the keyboard buffer so
that the F3 key does not recall the previous command line.

RESOLUTION
==========

Although the F3 key does not work, you can use the Microsoft MS-DOS DOSKEY
program (DOSKEY.COM) to recall the command. When the DOSKEY program is loaded
into memory, you can press the UP ARROW key to recall previous MS-DOS commands.
