SUMMARY
=======

This technical article describes a simple technique that uses the Media Control
Interface (MCI) to synchronize events in a Microsoft Windows-based application
with audio from a CD. The following topics are covered:

 - MCI message interface

 - Audio CD time formats

 - Owner-draw graphical buttons

 - Extending the idea to other time sources

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

Four pieces of sample code included with this article create four applications:
PLAYACD, a simple CD controller; SINGACD, a sing-along application that shows
the lyrics to a CD as it plays; TIMEACD, an authoring tool to create the lyric
files used by the sing-along application; and SINGAWAV, an application that
demonstrates synchronizing to a waveform.

The SINGACD sample application shows how to use the media control interface (MCI)
to synchronize an application with CD audio in Microsoft(R) Windows(TM).

SINGACD displays a moving ball above the lyrics of a song. The ball moves in time
with the music and (ideally) stays above the current word in the song. Achieving
this synchronization involves a two-part process: The first part involves
displaying the entire line of text at the right time; the second part involves
placing the ball over the correct word in the line.

SINGACD has the following components:

 - The PLAYACD application is a very simple controller for the MCI CD audio
   device.

 - The TIMEACD application is a tool for authoring lyric files.

 - The SINGAWAV sample is a modified version of SINGACD that opens and plays a
   specific wave file and lyric file.
