TITLE   :Diamond Viper Video Card Not Supported
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using a VESA 800x600 video driver with the Diamond Viper video card,
there may be some unusual behavior with the mouse, the keyboard and Program
Manager. You may be unable to select items with the mouse, the keyboard may be
disabled outside of the Main group, and you may not be able to move groups.

CAUSE
=====

The Diamond Viper video card is not on the Hardware Compatibility List for
Windows NT version 3.1. The Windows NT 3.1 generic drivers for VGA 640x480 and
VESA 800x600 are not expected to work correctly with this video card.

RESOLUTION
==========

A Diamond Viper PCI driver for Windows NT can be obtained from the Gateway 2000
BBS at (605) 232-2224. This driver is contained in a self-extracting file named
VPWN32.EXE (Video Library section). Note that this driver is currently in beta
test and unsupported by Gateway.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

NOTE: In Windows NT version 3.5, Viper cards using a 1.x or 2.x BIOS revision do
not work, and these cards cannot be upgraded. There are four different physical
revisions of the Viper. One uses a series 1.x BIOS, two use a series 2.x BIOS,
and one uses a series 3.x BIOS. If you look in the HCL you will note that it
states that the Viper must have a BIOS version 3.09, Rev. for "proper
performance." Translated, this means if you have anything other than a Rev. E
board, this will not work. And if you have a Rev. E board, you need BIOS 3.09.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
or reliability.
