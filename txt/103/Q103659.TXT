The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1

SUMMARY
=======

When you are starting the system from the Windows NT Setup Disk for CD-ROM
Installation or for Floppy Installation, if Setup hangs at the screen saying
"Setup is inspecting your computer's hardware configuration," you can use the
debug version of NTDETECT.COM to determine what component of the hardware might
be causing the problem. The debug version of NTDETECT.COM is located in the
following:

   Windows NT 3.1  - Windows NT 3.1 CD-ROM disc
                     (SUPPORT\SUPTOOLS\I386\NTDETECT.COM)
   Windows NT 3.5  - Contact Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS)
   Windows NT 3.51 - Windows NT CD-ROM disc
           and 4.0   (SUPPORT\DEBUG\I386\NTDETECT.CHK)
                     Rename NTDETECT.CHK to NTDETECT.COM.


MORE INFORMATION
================

NTDETECT.COM detects and builds the hardware component lists on Intel-based
(x86) computers. To use the debug version of NTDETECT.COM to determine why
Windows NT Setup is hanging at the "Setup is inspecting your computer's hardware
configuration" message, do the following:

1. Use the MS-DOS DISKCOPY command to copy the contents of the Windows NT Setup
   disk to a formatted, blank floppy disk.

2. Replace the NTDETECT.COM file on the copy of the Windows NT Setup disk
   created in step 1 with the NTDETECT.COM file mentioned above (for the
   appropriate version of Windows NT).

   NOTE: The debug version of NTDETECT.COM is not available on the Windows NT
   floppy disks.

3. Insert the copy of the Windows NT Setup disk you created in step 1 in drive A
   and restart the computer.

The debug version of NTDETECT.COM will display hardware information on the screen
as it is detected. To move to the next screen, press any key. Continue until
Setup hangs. The contents of the screen at the point of lockup should give you
an indication of what hardware component might be causing the problem.
