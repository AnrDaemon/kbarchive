The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In Windows NT Advanced Server, the Logon Hours set in Users Rights are
checked only at the actual logon time. If a User is logged on to
Domain B with Workstation A and the Administrator changes their logon
hours to not allow access to Domain B at that time, the user is NOT
logged off of Domain B automatically. The User would have to log off
and attempt to log back on before access would be denied. The Logon
Hours Rights for Users are set with the User Manager for Domains.


NOTE: This issue affects Windows NT Services for Macintosh as well.
