The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for MS-DOS, versions 4.0, 4.01 
 - Microsoft CodeView for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.01 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The keyword __far generates an error when used in a variable watch expression;
for example, "(char __far *) var". One of the following errors is generated,
depending upon whether you have the ANSI or the C++ expression evaluator
loaded:

   CAN0030: Error: expression cannot be evaluated

   -or-

   CXX0030: Error: expression cannot be evaluated

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the problem, use the keyword _far or far instead of __far.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in CodeView for MS-DOS versions 4.0
and 4.01 and CodeView for Windows versions 4.0 and 4.01. The problem was
corrected in CodeView version 4.1.
