SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to run Corel Photo-Paint versions 3.0 or 4.0 with Windows NT, you
receive the following error message:

   PntVideo.DRV not found or not enough memory

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs because the Photo-Paint application tries to access a
16-bit Windows 3.x driver.

Windows NT does not support 16-bit drivers or virtual device drivers (VxDs). As a
result, any application that requires such needs to be modified to run correctly
with Windows NT.
