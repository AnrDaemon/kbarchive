SUMMARY
=======

If you attempt to change Windows' configuration and you are NOT logged into the
Windows directory (where the SETUP.EXE resides) before you start Windows 3.0
SETUP.EXE, the Setup program does not detect that Windows 3.0 is already
installed and does not display the current Windows configuration as you would
expect. Instead, Setup begins installing a new copy of Windows 3.0.

To change the Windows configuration, log into the Windows directory from MS-DOS
before running SETUP.EXE

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version 3.0 provides instructions on
how to install new Windows device drivers on page 564 under "To install a device
driver not supplied with Windows." Step 1 is correct but does not specify that
you must be in the Windows directory after exiting Windows in order for Setup to
display the list of the current Windows configuration as expected in step 2.
