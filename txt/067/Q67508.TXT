The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The ROM BIOS version needed for Windows version 3.0 to run in standard (286
protected) mode on a Tandy 3000 is version 1.03.02.

The Tandy 3000 uses an OEM (original equipment manufacturer) Phoenix ROM BIOS.
The nomenclature of the OEM BIOS does not follow the "generic" ROM BIOS
nomenclature. It is important that the Tandy/Phoenix ROM BIOS version 1.03.02 or
later is used in these systems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

BIOS versions earlier than 1.03.02 do not allow the 80286 processor to run in
protected mode. Therefore, systems with an earlier ROM BIOS cannot run version
3.00 in standard mode. This error message may be displayed, indicating a
possible need for a ROM BIOS upgrade:

   Unexpected hardware interrupt

For more information, or for help in upgrading your ROM BIOS, please contact
Tandy technical support or contact your local Tandy computer center.
