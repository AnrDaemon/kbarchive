SUMMARY
=======

To set up and run Microsoft Windows 3.0 on a machine with the AST 3G Plus II EGA
video adapter, check the following:

1. Disable the autoswitching, which is termed "autoemulation" by AST, by turning
   off dip switches #5 and #6. The remaining switches determine the type of
   monitor.

2. Check the ROM BIOS. If the BIOS version is earlier than 3.0, obtain an
   upgrade of 3.0 or later from AST.

3. Set the emulation switch to off. The emulation switch is on the back of the
   card where the monitor plugs into the board. Early versions of the card have
   the switch, so you must look on the back of the card to know if the switch is
   there. According to AST, having the switch in the on position could cause
   video problems when you run DOS applications under Windows.
