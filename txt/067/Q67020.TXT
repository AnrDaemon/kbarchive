The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you are setting up Fontware and adding a typeface, you may get the
following message:

   Unable to copy all typeface information. Errors occurred while copying
   typefaces.

This message is generated when the Fontware kit is unable to read the disk from
which you are trying to copy. If you are using a backup of a Fontware
Installation Kit disk or a Bitstream Scalable Typeface disk, exit the kit, make
a new backup copy, and try again. If the disk is an original typeface disk, you
will need to obtain a replacement disk.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit is available through a fulfillment coupon
included with the retail version of Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows. This
starter kit will install fonts for Windows applications only; however, the kit
can be merged with other starter kits to provide support for multiple
applications as described above.
