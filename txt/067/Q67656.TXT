TITLE   :Zenith ZBF-3339-EK 16 MHz 386 Conflict w/ Server Services
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

Failure to complete a NET START NETLOGON command, with general network failure
error 2136 indicates a hardware conflict. In one reported case, the system
included a WD8003E Ethercard Plus card and the MACWD.OS2 driver, configured
correctly.

CAUSE
=====

Although the interrupts were correct, something still conflicted with OS/2 LAN
Manager.

RESOLUTION
==========

NET START NETLOGON completed successfully when these changes were made:

 - INT to 5

 - Mem to D1000

 - IOAddress to 300

Note: Because this problem was due to a hardware conflict, Error 2136 could have
been generated by any number of other server service commands (for example,
REPLICATOR).

Additional query words: 2.00 2.0 2.10 2.1 2.10a 2.1a 2.20 2.2
