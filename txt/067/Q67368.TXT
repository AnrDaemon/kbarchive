The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to delete a file, you receive the error message:

   Access denied

CAUSE
=====

This most commonly occurs when the file has the Read-Only attribute set. The
Read-Only attribute prevents a file from being deleted or modified.


WORKAROUND
==========

If the file has the Read-Only file attribute set, use the ATTRIB command to
remove that attribute and then delete or modify the file. For example, to remove
the Read-Only file attribute from MYFILE.DOC, type "attrib -r myfile.doc"
(without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information about the ATTRIB command, refer to your MS-DOS
documentation.
