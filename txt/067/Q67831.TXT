TITLE   :Flt Sim: Outer Marker at Paine Field Not Working with ADF
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

When the ADF frequency is set to the frequency of the outer-marker (396) at
Snohomish County Airport (Paine Field) in Everett, Washington, the ADF needle
will not function.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the customer has Aircraft & Scenery Designer, this problem can be
resolved by placing a nondirectional beacon (NDB) in the location of the
outer-marker and setting the frequency of the NDB to 396. The following
coordinates give the approximate position of the outer- marker while directly in
line with the runway at Paine Field.

   North    21583.8509
   East     6684.9234
   Heading  156

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Flight Simulator version 4.00. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.
