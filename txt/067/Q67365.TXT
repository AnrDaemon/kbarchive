TITLE   :Err Msg When Booting System: NO ROM BASIC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.x,4.x,5.x,6.0,6.2,6.21,6.22; WINDOWS:95

KEYWORDS:msdos win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you partition your hard disk and install MS-DOS or Windows 95, you may
receive the following message when you turn on your computer:

   NO ROM BASIC

   SYSTEM HALTED

CAUSE
=====

You did not select an active partition. (You must do this in addition to
partitioning the hard disk.)

Note that this error message can also occur if the motherboard in your computer
is failing.

RESOLUTION
==========

To select an active partition, choose the Set Active Partition option on the
FDISK main menu. The only MS-DOS or Windows 95 partition that can be set as
active is the primary DOS partition.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the computer is started, the boot routine polls drive A for a valid boot
disk. If no boot disk is detected, the system reads the boot sector from the
first physical hard disk. The partition table is examined for a partition with a
boot indicator. If no partitions are marked as bootable, the system executes an
interrupt 18H, which transfers control to ROM Basic.

Only IBM personal computers have Basic included in ROM; on a compatible,
interrupt 18H typically displays the message "NO ROM BASIC," then "SYSTEM
HALTED," and the system halts.

Under these conditions, some older Compaq DESKPRO computers display the message:

   Non-System disk or disk error
   replace and strike any key when ready

It is also possible for some systems to return the message:

   System does not support resident BASIC

If this behavior occurs when there is a bootable floppy disk in drive A, make
sure that the boot sequence is set to drive A and then drive C in the computer's
CMOS settings (instead of drive C and then drive A).
