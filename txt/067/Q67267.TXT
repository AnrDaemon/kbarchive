======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Run= line in the WIN.INI file to start a windowed MS-DOS
application followed by a Windows application, the keyboard input goes to the
MS-DOS application. The focus remains on the MS-DOS application in the
background and does not switch to the Windows application in the foreground as
you would expect. This only happens in 386 enhanced mode.

The following is a sample WIN.INI run line:

        Run=word.pif winword.exe

WORKAROUND
==========

To switch the focus to the Windows application in the foreground, click anywhere
in the Windows application with the mouse. If you do not have a mouse, press
ALT+ESC.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
