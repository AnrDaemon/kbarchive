TITLE   :PWB Hyperlink in PWB.HLP is Inconsistent in Version 1.1
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:1.1; OS/2:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, version 1.1 
 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When selecting help on the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) version 1.1 from the
Categories menu in QuickHelp version 1.7, the help screen for Microsoft Advisor
Help System is presented instead. This behavior may be duplicated by following
the procedure outlined below:

1. Start QuickHelp without an argument to get help on any topic. This will bring
   up the main help screen.

2. Select the Programmer's WorkBench choice under the Categories menu.

Instead of bringing up the help screen for Programmer's WorkBench, you will see
the screen for the Microsoft Advisor Help System.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the PWB.HLP help file is decoded using helpmake as follows

   helpmake /D /T /Opwb.doc pwb.hlp

we can see that the reason for this is that the .context directive for
Programmer's WorkBench appears in the wrong section in the decoded help file.
The following line

   .context Programmer's Workbench

appears above the section for "Microsoft Advisor Contents." To correct the
problem, move the .context directive for Programmer's WorkBench to the proper
section, which is the "Programmer's WorkBench Contents."

The helpfile must then be recompressed, as follows:

   helpmake /E7 /T /Opwb.hlp pwb.doc

The choice of /E7 is shown here for demonstration purposes only, and is strictly
arbitrary in this case. If maximum compression is desired, the numerical
argument to the /E switch may be left off, or /E15 may be specified. Maximum
compression will restore the database as close to its original size and state as
possible.
