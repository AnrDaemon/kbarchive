SUMMARY
=======

If the Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit never asks for disk 2 of the
Bitstream Scalable Typeface Package, some files in a Bitstream Scalable Typeface
Package may not be needed, depending on the devices you select when you set up
Fontware. If the kit doesn't need disk 2 of the Bitstream Scalable Typeface
Package, it won't ask for it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit is available through a fulfillment coupon
included with the retail version of Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows. This
starter kit will install fonts for Windows applications only; however, the kit
can be merged with other starter kits to provide support for multiple
applications.
