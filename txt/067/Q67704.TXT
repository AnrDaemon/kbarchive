There is a documentation error on page 82 of the "Microsoft Windows
User's Guide" for version 3.0 near the bottom of the page. The statement
reads as follows:

   Group Windows do not close like other Windows. If you double-click the
   group's Control-menu box or choose Close from the Control menu, Program
   Manager shrinks the group to a program item icon.

Program Manager group windows shrink to group icons, not program item
icons.

The statement should read as follows:

   Group Windows do not close like other Windows. If you double-click the
   group's Control-menu box or choose Close from the Control menu, Program
   Manager shrinks the group to a group icon.
