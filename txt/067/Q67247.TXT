SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Download Center contains a custom control DLL and documentation
for a custom control class, MicroScroll. These controls are essentially small
scroll bars with no scroll box, and perform no scroll-box tracking.

MicroScroll controls are small enough to be placed next to edit controls to
create a spin button, such as those in the Date/Time dialog box in the Control
Panel. Spin buttons are discussed on pages 86 and 87 of the IBM CUA guide, which
is included with the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK).

The archive file in the Microsoft Download Center, MUSCROLL, contains the
following files:

   Filename      Description
   --------      -----------
   MUSCROLL.DLL  MicroScroll custom control DLL. Currently, the source
                 files necessary to build the custom control are not
                 available to the public.

   MUSCROLL.H    Header file containing control styles and messages
                 that define the interface to the control.

   MUSCROLL.HLP  Windows Help file describing the control interface
                 and notes on using the control in an application.

   MUSTEST.ZIP   Code for a test program that uses MicroScroll
                 controls to implement a numeric spin button and to
                 add horizontal scrolling capabilities to a
                 single line edit control.
