TITLE   :System Doesn't Save Time and Date Changes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.20, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You use the MS-DOS TIME and DATE commands to change the time and date on your
system, but the system time and date are not saved when you reboot.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs if you are using a version of MS-DOS earlier than 3.3.
Versions of MS-DOS earlier than version 3.3 do not update the CMOS time/date
chip.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you are using a version of MS-DOS earlier than 3.3, you can use the CMOS
setup utility provided by the computer manufacturer to change CMOS settings.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Only AT-class machines store the time/date information in standard CMOS memory.
XT-class machines do not have a built-in mechanism for storing the time and
date. Manufacturers of XT-class machines sometimes add a clock/calendar chip to
their systems. MS-DOS does not recognize this hardware unless the system is
running a version of MS-DOS that has been modified by the manufacturer to work
with their hardware.

If an AT-class system running MS-DOS 3.3 or later continually loses the time and
date, the battery that powers the CMOS memory may need to be replaced.
