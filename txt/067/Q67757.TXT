-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Page 336 of the "Microsoft Macro Assembler 5.1 Programmer's Guide" shipped with
MASM version 5.0 and 5.1 has a table that lists the various conditional jump
instructions, what each means, and whether each acts on a signed or unsigned
value. The table has the signed/unsigned values mixed up.

The table currently states:

   Letter  Meaning
   ------  -------

    J      Jump
    G      Greater than (for unsigned comparisons)
    L      Less than (for unsigned comparisons)
    A      Above (for signed comparisons)
    B      Below (for signed comparisons)
    E      Equal
    N      Not

It should read:

   Letter  Meaning
   ------  -------

    J      Jump
    G      Greater than (for signed comparisons)
    L      Less than (for signed comparisons)
    A      Above (for unsigned comparisons)
    B      Below (for unsigned comparisons)
    E      Equal
    N      Not

Additional query words: 5.00 5.10 5.10a
