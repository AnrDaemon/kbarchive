SUMMARY
=======

The online Help system for Microsoft C versions 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0ax lists the
wrong warning level for compiler warnings C4127 and C4135. The help system
states that both of these are level 4 warnings; however, they actually appear
when compiling at warning level 3 (/W3).

The online Help systems for Microsoft C/C++ versions 7.0 and Visual C++ for
Windows version 1.0 incorrectly list the warning level for C4127, but lists the
correct warning level for the compiler warning C4135.

The online Help systems for Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition versions 1.0 and
2.0 correctly list the warning level for C4127 as 4.

The online Help system for Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows version 1.5 correctly
lists the warning levels for both C4127 and C4135.

Additional query words: 6.00 6.00a 7.00 8.00 9.00 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.10
