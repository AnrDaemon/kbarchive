SUMMARY
=======

When the 747 enhanced instrument panel is active, the NUMLOCK key is permanently
enabled. It will remain on even if you try to disable the NUMLOCK.

This is due to the map that is permanently displayed as part of the enhanced
instrument panel. The status of the NUMLOCK key will not interfere with other
key commands in Flight Simulator.
