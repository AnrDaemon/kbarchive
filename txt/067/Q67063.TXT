SUMMARY
=======

The "\a" character used with the InsertMenu() function is NOT considered to be a
C language "\a", but is instead considered to be a resource compiler "\a". This
code in the resource compiler is translated to a backspace character. Thus, an
"\a" used in the resource compiler is really considered to be a "\b" or an
"\x08" within the C Language.

When an "\x08" (backspace) is used, the menu item behaves as expected. However,
you must place at least one character, which can be a space, before the "\b".
For example:

      (LPSTR)" \bsometext"

NOTE: This is still true in Windows 3.1; however, the leading blank is not
necessary. The above example should be modified as follows:

      (LPSTR)"\bsometext"

This is not the case for Windows 95. In Windows 95, the MFT_RIGHTJUSTIFY flag
should be used with InsertMenuItem()/SetMenuItemInfo/MENUEX resource.
