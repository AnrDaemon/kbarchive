SUMMARY
=======

The TYPE operator in MASM returns a number that represents the type of an
identifier or expression. With the inline assembly capability in the compiler,
the TYPE operator does not have the full functionality that it does in MASM. In
an _asm block, the TYPE operator will only accept an identifier because
expressions are not allowed.

Additional query words: 8.00 8.00c 9.00
