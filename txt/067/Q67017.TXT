SUMMARY
=======

When you make fonts with the Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit, not all the
phases may be completed.

You may have run out of memory. Check the Fontware error log for this "make
fonts" session to see if this is the case. If it is, you may have memory
resident programs or device drivers loaded in your system that can be removed
temporarily. Make backup copies of your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files; edit
the original files, increase the amount of free memory, and reboot the computer
under this new configuration.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit is available through a fulfillment coupon
included with the retail version of Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows. This
starter kit will install fonts for Windows applications only; however, the kit
can be merged with other starter kits to provide support for multiple
applications.
