TITLE   :PRB: Inconsistent Error Attempting to Load Nonexistent Extension
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER:OS/2:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to load an OS/2 Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) extension through a
macro definition in the TOOLS.INI file, if the extension file does not exist, or
is not in the current path, the following error message is displayed in a dialog
box:

   pwbhelp: SYS0123: A file name or volume label contains an incorrect character

CAUSE
=====

This error message should indicate that the extension file could not be found;
however, the message is generated by the OS/2 operating system's DLL loading
code, and therefore, cannot be changed by PWB.

The following error message is generated in the MS-DOS version of PWB, which
displays this message in a dialog box:

   No such file or directory

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the problem, make sure that the directory in which the extension
resides is in the current path.
