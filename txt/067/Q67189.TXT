======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

You cannot add an Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) frequency with
Microsoft Flight Simulator Aircraft & Scenery Designer version 4.00. This is
by program design.

ATIS is a continuous-loop recording of important air traffic information
broadcast over a specific frequency. It is used to inform pilots of important
weather and airfield conditions, and is usually updated once an hour.
