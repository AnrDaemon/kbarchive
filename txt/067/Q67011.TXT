The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a

SUMMARY
=======

When the EGA.SYS device driver version 2.10.18 included with Microsoft Windows
version 3.0 is loaded in CONFIG.SYS, it displays the following message on the
screen as a default:

   Command line parameters:

   FUNC=XX, to change INT 2FH function number. (where XX is 80 through FF
   hexadecimal inclusive)

For example:

   DEVICE=EGA.SYS FUNC=AC

   Using default value of BCH for interrupt 2FH function calls. A copy of the EGA
   Device Driver is being installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This message is no cause for alarm. The length of this message can be reduced by
adding the FUNC=XX parameter on the end of the DEVICE=EGA.SYS line, where XX
refers to the default value in the message on your computer screen. In the
example message above, this modification would appear similar to the following:

       DEVICE=EGA.SYS FUNC=BC

Once this change is made, the message on the screen reads as follows:

   Using user defined value of BCH for interrupt 2FH function calls.
