The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS, version 5.1 
 - Microsoft LINK for OS/2, version 5.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

On pages 30 and 31 of the "Microsoft C Reference" manual shipped with C versions
6.00 and 6.00a, there are contradictory references to the far-call translation
options available for LINK. On page 30 under the /F[ARCALLTRANSLATION] option,
far-call translations are listed as being "turned on by default." On the other
hand, on page 31 under the /NOF[ARCALLTRANSLATION] option, far-calls are listed
as being "off by default."

The statement on page 30 is the one that is incorrect because the correct default
for far-call translations is "off." Far calls are done only when /F is
explicitly specified to LINK.

Note that when the CL command is used to invoke LINK, CL itself is responsible
for passing the /F option to the linker.
