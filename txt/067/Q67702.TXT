MORE INFORMATION
================

This application can run successfully in a window or full screen. You should
avoid loading any TSR (terminate-and-stay-resident) programs such as "Billmind"
before starting Windows. TSR programs are known to cause problems when loaded
before Windows. See page 442 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for
information on running TSRs under Windows.

If an MS-DOS application is started and closed from a PIF file without the Close
Window On Exit option checked, an inactive application window will remain open.
To close an inactive application window, press ALT+SPACEBAR and choose Close
from the window control pull-down menu (-).

Quicken is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
