SUMMARY
=======

The Kensington Expert Mouse driver may not work properly with Flight Simulator
version 4.00.

A possible workaround is to use a Microsoft mouse driver. Customers should also
contact Kensington at (800) 535-4242 to check on the availability of an updated
driver.

Microsoft has not tested this configuration and therefore cannot guarantee its
results.
