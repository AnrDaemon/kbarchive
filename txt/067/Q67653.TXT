SUMMARY
=======

A Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) client application receives a WM_DDE_DATA message
when the DDE server has data to transmit. The low-order word of lParam contains
the handle to a global memory object containing the data. If the DDE client is
unable to lock the handle to access the data [GlobalLock() returns NULL], the
DDE client should send a negative acknowledgment to the DDE server. A negative
acknowledgment is a WM_DDE_ACK message with the fAck bit set to zero.

DDE is discussed in Chapter 15 of the "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
Reference Volume 2."
