The "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version 3.0 contains incorrect
information in the "Configuring an 8086 or 8088 Computer" near the bottom
of page 502. The statement reads:

   If your system has an EGA monitor and you run non-Windows applications with
   Windows in real mode or standard mode, your CONFIG.SYS file should contain a
   command line like the following:

   device=c:\windows\ega.sys "

An 8086 or 8088 computer cannot run Windows in standard mode. Standard
mode requires a 80286, 80386, or 80486 microprocessor and extended
memory.
