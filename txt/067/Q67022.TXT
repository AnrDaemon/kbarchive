SUMMARY
=======

If you get the following message when you run the Fontware Setup program, and
you enter the Fontware directory name

   Unable to make this directory. Choose a different directory

you have entered a directory name that the kit cannot create on your hard disk.
Press ESC and enter a different directory name. This may indicate a general
problem with writing to your hard disk, or you may have selected the name of a
file that already exists. Note that Fontware will not accept any directory name
that DOS does not accept as a directory name.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit is available through a fulfillment coupon
included with the retail version of Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows. This
starter kit will install fonts for Windows applications only; however, the kit
can be merged with other starter kits to provide support for multiple
applications.
