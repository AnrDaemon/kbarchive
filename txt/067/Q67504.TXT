SUMMARY
=======

The Epson Series-80, the FX, RX, and MX (older versions) may not print correctly
with Microsoft Windows without a ROM upgrade, which is available from Epson.

To test to see if your Epson printer needs this ROM upgrade, do the following:

1. Turn off the printer.

2. Turn the printer back on while holding down the line feed button.

3. The printer will begin to do a self test. If the printer keeps printing after
   three to four lines, you need the graphics upgrade. If it stops, you already
   have the upgrade installed, or you have a newer printer with the ROM upgrade
   built in.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The upgrade is called Dots Perfect; it is a chip that fits on the printer
board.

To order Dots Perfect, contact Epson.

You will need to specify your printer model and type because there is a different
chip for each model. This chip will also allow your printer to print graphics.
