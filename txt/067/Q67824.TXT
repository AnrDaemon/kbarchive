SUMMARY
=======

When taking off, the Cessna 182R may stall when pulling up. It also may seem
underpowered and slow to pick up speed.

This is due to the trim being set for a tail-down or nose-up attitude in the
Chicago Meigs field start-up mode. The trim has been set so the plane can take
off at a relatively slow speed.

Press 7 on the numeric keypad a few times to adjust for less trim or a nose-up
attitude. More speed will then be necessary to take off, but once off the
ground, you will be able to use more elevator without getting a stall warning.
The plane will also be able to achieve a higher cruising speed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The trim is used to counteract air pressure on the elevators. It allows the
pilot to fine tune the attitude of the airplane so that the pilot doesn't have
to hold the yoke to maintain a desired rate of climb.

The use of trim is the same for all aircraft that have it.

These methods are very much a part of actual flight and the laws of aerodynamics.
