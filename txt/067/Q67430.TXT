TITLE   :Using Automatic Scenery Selection with SubLOGIC Scenery

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

If a single SubLOGIC scenery disk is installed, option A (Automatic Scenery
Selection) on the Nav/Com menu is not active. When two or more SubLOGIC scenery
disks are installed, option A is active. When option A is active, a mode that
makes use of SubLOGIC scenery will automatically load the appropriate scenery
file without further intervention.

If you are using a single SubLOGIC scenery disk, you must, from the Nav/Com menu,
select Scenery Library, then select the desired SubLOGIC scenery file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some SubLOGIC scenery files do not work properly with the Automatic Scenery
Selection feature. It may therefore be necessary to manually select the scenery
file from the Scenery Library.
