SUMMARY
=======

There is no feature in Flight Simulator that will allow for simulated snow as
part of the weather generator.

However, you can get an interesting effect by doing the following:

1. From the Enviro menu, select option B, Clouds.

2. Select 5, Bottom Level Tops, type "1000" (without the quotation marks), and
   press ENTER.

3. Press 7, Cover, until "scattered 1/8" appears.

4. Press SPACEBAR to return to flight mode.

The clouds will appear as small white circles that look like snow.
