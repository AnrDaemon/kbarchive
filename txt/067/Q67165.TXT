SUMMARY
=======

The source code for version 3.0 of the Microsoft Windows communications driver,
COMM.DRV, uses the AllocCStoDSAlias function. This function is not documented
and will not be supported in future versions of Windows.

The proper method to create a code or data selector for a block of memory is to
use the PrestoChangoSelector function. This function is documented as the
ChangeSelector function in the "Windows Software Development Kit Reference
Volume 1" manual for Windows 3.0.
