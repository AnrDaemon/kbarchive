TITLE   :OS/2 LAN Manager: Last Logon Information Sometimes Incorrect
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

If you log onto a domain controller from the NET shell, you should receive the
time of the last logon. However, "NEVER" is always displayed. Also, if you view
the user account information, Last Logon always shows "NEVER."

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in OS/2 LAN Manager version 2.00. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.

This problem can be avoided by specifying a particular server for a user to log
onto. The server can be specified when creating or viewing a user account in the
full screen "net admin" interface. Choosing the "<Paths>" option displays
a dialog box that allows the following choices:

   Logon server .  .  .     (.) Domain Controller
                            ( ) Any Server
                            ( ) Servername [.................]

Choosing the "Domain Controller" or "Servername" option will enable this
particular server to keep track of the last time the user logged onto the
network (in the user's domain).

If "Any Server" (which is the default) is specified, the system cannot track this
logon information.
