======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

The SHIFT+INSERT key combination does not work on Tandy 1000 keyboards.
SHIFT+INSERT should zoom out on the 747 panel map.

The SHIFT+DELETE key combination will zoom in properly.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Aircraft & Scenery Designer
version 4.00. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
as it becomes available.
