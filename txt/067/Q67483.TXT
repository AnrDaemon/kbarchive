TITLE   :PWB Hangs with Novell Netware
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities

KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On certain installations of a Novell network, the network may cause
the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) to hang. This problem may also occur
in CodeView or QuickC. The hang usually occurs when an attempt is made
to use the mouse.

If you have a peripheral (such as a mouse) that uses Interrupt Request
Level (IRQ) 3, and your system is part of a network using Novell
NetWare version 2.15 or earlier, your system may hang when you load
QuickC, PWB, or CodeView. As a temporary solution, set your peripheral
to use another interrupt. For more information, contact your Novell
NetWare dealer.

If taking these steps does not solve the problem, please contact
Microsoft Product Support Services.
