SUMMARY
=======

The "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit Reference Volume 1" for the
Windows SDK version 3.0 (pages 4-80 and 4-418) and the "Microsoft Windows
Software Development Kit Programmer's Reference, Volume 2: Functions" for the
Windows SDK version 3.1 (page 204) incorrectly document the DeferWindowPos() and
SetWindowPos() functions. The text explanation for the flags of these functions
should be corrected to read as follows:

   The flags parameter specifies the 16-bit value that affect the size and
   position of the window. This parameter can be a combination of the following
   8 values which can be combined by using the bitwise OR operator.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.10 docerr
