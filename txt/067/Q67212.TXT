SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows Calendar does not print the month view graphics grid. Calendar
only prints text that describes the appointment schedule, along with the dates
and times displayed in the day view for each day within the From/To print
range.

You can work around these limitations as described in the following paragraphs.

Printing the Month View
-----------------------

To print the month view, proceed as follows:

1. Display the month on your screen.

2. Press ALT+PRTSC to capture the month into the clipboard.

3. Open Windows Paintbrush, and paste the month view in. Be sure to maximize
   Paintbrush before pasting, or some of the calendar may be truncated.

4. Print the month view from Paintbrush.

Printing Blank Appointment Schedule Times
-----------------------------------------

Calendar only prints appointment schedule times that have appointment entries. To
force Calendar to print a "blank" appointment entry, enter a space on each time
line that you want to print.

Printing Headers and Footers
----------------------------

Calendar can also print headers and footers that contain text and special codes
that insert the following information:

   Code    Information
   ----    -----------

   &d      The current date
   &p      Page numbers
   &f      The current filename
   &l      Header or footer text justified at the left margin
   &r      Header or footer text justified at the right margin
   &c      Header or footer text centered between the margins
