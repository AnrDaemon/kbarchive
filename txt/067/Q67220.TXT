======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a Compuadd 316 SL Laptop computer, when you operate an MS-DOS application
under Microsoft Windows 3.0, 3.0a or 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode and you exit the
MS-DOS application, the display screen splits and the machine locks up.

CAUSE
=====

The Compuadd 316 SL Laptop requires the VDDDRAG.386 device driver to run Windows
3.0, 3.0a, or 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode. All new models of the 316 SL are shipped
with this driver, as well as Windows 3.0, 3.0a or 3.1, installed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To verify that the VDDDRAG.386 driver has been installed, check the Windows
SYSTEM.INI file [386Enh] section for the following device line:

        device=vdddrag.386

The driver was shipped on a supplementary disk with some older models of the 316
SL. The VDDDRAG.386 device driver may be obtained from Compuadd technical
support at (800) 999-9901 or downloaded from the Compuadd BBS at (512) 250-3226.
The file to download is 316SLDRV.ZIP.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The 316 SL is equipped with a screen saving device that is dependent on the BIOS
of the keyboard. The saver is not compatible with Windows and should be disabled
before running Windows. To disable the screen saver, from the MS-DOS prompt
press CTRL+LEFT SHIFT+L. This sequence toggles the screen saver function on and
off.

Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
