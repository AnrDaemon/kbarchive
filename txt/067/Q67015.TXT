======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you get the following message when you make fonts

   Some typeface information missing. Go to Add/Delete Bitstream Fontware
   Typefaces

you have chosen a typeface that the Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit (FIK)
does not find on your system, even though the name is listed in the Make Fonts
windows. This may happen if you have both a PostScript PDL and non-PostScript
PDL printer and you added the typeface before setting up Fontware support for
the PostScript PDL printer. Choose Add/Delete Bitstream Fontware Typefaces and
add the typeface again. Then make your fonts.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are using the starter kit that is available through the fulfillment
coupon included with PowerPoint, and you attempt to make PostScript PDL fonts
from your free Dutch and Swiss typefaces, you will get the same error message.
Times Roman and Helvetica are resident on most PostScript PDL printers; the
files needed for Dutch and Swiss PostScript PDL fonts are not shipped with the
starter kit. Either purchase Bitstream Scalable Typeface Packages for Dutch and
Swiss or select Times Roman and Helvetica in your Windows application.

A Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit is available through a fulfillment coupon
included with the retail version of Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows. This
starter kit will install fonts for Windows applications only; however, the kit
can be merged with other starter kits to provide support for multiple
applications as described above.
