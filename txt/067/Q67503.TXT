The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Windows Notepad version 3.0, if you choose Page Setup from the File
menu and set Top Margin to 0 (zero), the first two lines print on top of each
other or overlap. This problem affects the following Hewlett- Packard (HP)
printers:

   HP LaserJet Series II
   HP LaserJet Series IIP
   HP LaserJet Series IID
   HP LaserJet Series III

This problem occurs because you are attempting to print outside the areas where
the printer is capable of printing.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Most HP LaserJet Series printers can print no closer than .25 inch from the page
margins. To correct the problem, set Top Margin to .25 inch or greater.

NOTE: Most PostScript printers exclude the first line and start printing with the
second line.

The HP products included here are manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
