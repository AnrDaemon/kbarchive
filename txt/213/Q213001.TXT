TITLE   :SMS: Remote Control Session Fails if Command Contains Quotes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbClient kbMMC kbRemote kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbHelpDesk kbsmsUtil kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an administrator runs a remote execute command containing quotes during a
remote control session, Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) tries to run
the command on the client but fails. As a result, the remote-control session on
the site server computer temporarily stops responding.

The status responds with a "Communication Failure" error, and the site server
loses the connection with the client, causing the tools window to close.

After the tools window is closed, subsequent attempts to re-establish another
remote tools session fail. The client remains stuck trying to run a command that
it cannot process.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the client is holding onto the initial remote
session, preventing it from responding to another remote control request.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, manually close the command dialog box that is running
on the client computer; doing so allows a remote tools session to reconnect.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server 2.0.
