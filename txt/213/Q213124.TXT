TITLE   :SMS: Clients Hang After Installation of Hardware Inventory Agent
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

International versions of Windows 3.x and Windows 9x clients stop responding
(hang) after installation of the Hardware Inventory Agent components on NEC-PC98
computers.

WORKAROUND
==========

Run REGNEC98.exe manually before other client installation programs to prevent
the system from hanging when installing the Hardware Inventory Agent.

REGNEC98.exe, found on the International Client Pack 4, is a program that
registers the client computer as a NEC-PC98 computer. Running this program sends
a signal to subsequent installation programs that this computer requires
NEC-PC98-specific components.

If no signature or an incorrect signature is found, PC/AT client components are
installed by default.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
