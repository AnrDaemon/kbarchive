======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to a NetWare network with one account and then log on to a local
Microsoft Windows NT-based computer (workstation or member server) with another
account, the LastLogonUserName property for that resource becomes the local
Windows NT user name.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because SMS places an API call to the network redirector for
the LastLogonUserName. The information returned is dependent on the redirector
that is installed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, synchronize logins so that the NetWare user name
matches the Windows NT user name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
