TITLE   :SMS: NDS Logon Manager Does Not Create Logon Point
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbConfig kbSecurity kbServer kbsms200 kbBindery kbNDS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Novell Directory Service (NDS) Logon Server Manager, and there is a
residual bindery site system connection account in existence, Logon Server
Manager does not create a logon point as expected.

CAUSE
=====

NDS Logon Server Manager attempts to use the connection left behind by the
Bindery Logon Server Manager and/or the Inbox Manager site system connection
account.

WORKAROUND
==========

When both Bindery and NDS site systems are configured on the same NetWare server
by the same SMS site server, both a bindery and an NDS site system connection
account must exist. Both accounts need adequate permissions to the site system
volumes, and both require write permissions to the NDS Logon Point container
object properties. Both accounts also require Supervisor-equivalent permissions
in the bindery context to have bindery script updating capability.
