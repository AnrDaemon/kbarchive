======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server 2.0 the Software Metering client agent, in online
mode, does not use the client retry setting properly. In situations where a
client's primary software metering server is unavailable, the client quickly
migrates to a new software metering server without attempting all of the
configured retries specified in the client agent properties.

This can cause license denials due to a lack of licenses available at the new
software metering server after the clients have migrated from their unavailable,
primary metering server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The client retry setting can be set in the General tab of the Software Metering
Client Agent properties.
