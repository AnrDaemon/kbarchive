TITLE   :CFS: Map Orientation Is Fixed to the North at High Altitudes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui fsim kbimu msgame

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator: WWII Europe Series, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you fly at high altitudes in Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator, the
aircraft map orientation may be fixed to the north.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, slew at lower altitudes.

NOTE: When you zoom the map view so that you can see the world globe, you slew at
a very high speed.

When you slew at a very high speed over long distances, it may be difficult to
slew in the direction that you want when the map orientation is fixed to the
north.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Combat Flight
Simulator: WWII Europe Series, version 1.0.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post more information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base when it becomes available.
