TITLE   :SMS: SMS Icons Don't Appear After Windows NT 4 Client Discovery
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbClient kbsms kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Systems Management Server icons do not appear in Control Panel after you
perform Windows NT 4.0 client discovery.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Mfc42.dll file in the \%system root%\System32
folder must be updated to a later version. A user with insufficient rights
cannot replace files in the \%system root%\System32 folder. This may be caused
by any MFC42.dll file whose version is earlier than 4.21.7303.

WORKAROUND
==========

If a client installation method has been enabled, the newer version of Mfc42.dll
is copied over to the client. Or, if another application has been installed that
will update Mfc42.dll to a later version, such as Microsoft Office 2000, the
Systems Management Server icon will then appear in the client's Control Panel.
