TITLE   :Smsman.exe Does Not Display Error Message When Setup Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbtool kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Systems Management Installation Wizard (Smsman.exe) does not report an error
message even though the Systems Management Server 2.0 client installation
failed.

NOTE: An error message is displayed on the client computer if the initial file
copy phase does not complete successfully.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the Systems Management Installation Wizard (Smsman.exe) to manually
install Systems Management Server 2.0 clients.

The Systems Management Installation Wizard reports that it completed successfully
if it is able to find a Systems Management Server logon point and successfully
initiate the client installation.

If the installation fails after the Systems Management Installation Wizard
initiates the client installation, the error is recorded in the Wnmanual.log
file located in the \Ms\Sms\Logs folder.
