TITLE   :SMS: Error When Using DISTINCT Keyword Inside Count Query in WQL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200preSP4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the DISTINCT keyword inside of the COUNT function in a Web-Based
Enterprise Management (WBEM) Query Language (WQL) query, an error message
appears and it fails to run.

For example, if you run the following WQL query:

   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CollectionID) from SMS_Collection

the following error message appears:

   Failed to parse WQL stringSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CollectionID) FROM
   SMS_Collection

The query should return a generic object with the number of collections as a
property.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
   Pack

Using the same example, run the following query:

   SELECT DISTINCT CollectionID from SMS_Collection

If you are doing this programmatically use the appropriate API. If you are using
WBEMTEST, the number of objects are returned in the Query Result window.
