PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbClient kbsms kbsms200 kbsmsMeter

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0

SYMPTOMS
========

The Software Metering Client Agent suspends software metering operations on the
client when the computer's hard disk is nearly full. This behavior is
independent of the roll that the computer has.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the free disk space on the software metering client falls below 200 KB, the
client suspends software metering functions without writing a log file entry.
Once the client is in suspend mode, it checks every 60 seconds to see if the
free disk space available has risen above 200 KB. If at least this much space
again becomes available, the client resumes operation and writes the following
log file entry:

   

   Drive space now available - Resuming Client
