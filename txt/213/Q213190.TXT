KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsmsMeter

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you enable original-name mode under "Program name policy" for Software
Metering, the client looks in the header of the program to find the program
name. This name in the header may or may not have an extension. Programs that do
not have an extension (such as CharMap) cannot be registered because you are
unable to save the entry.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
