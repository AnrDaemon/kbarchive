TITLE   :SMS: Unable to Schedule Software Metering Table Maintenance
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may notice that performance levels of the online Software Metering Service
decrease occasionally.

CAUSE
=====

The Software Metering Service (Remodbc.exe) performs maintenance on the database
tables once a week by default. Software Metering Service database maintenance
may experience problems if a table is open when maintenance is scheduled to
occur.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use one or both of the following procedures:

Pack the Software Metering Tables Manually
------------------------------------------

1. Using the Systems Management Server 2.0 Administrators console, expand the
   Tools folder for your site.

2. Right-click SMS Service Manager, point to All Tasks, and then click "Start
   SMS Service Manager".

3. Click the plus sign (+) beside LICENSE_METERING.

4. In the right pane, right-click LICENSE_METERING, and then click Query.

5. Right-click LICENSE_METERING, and then click Stop.

6. Once again, right-click LICENSE_METERING, and then click Query until the
   service status reports "stopped."

7. Use the steps above to also stop LICSVR_SERVICE.

8. Stop the SMS_LICENSE_SERVER service on each software metering server.

9. Navigate to the Software Metering folder (swmtr), which is located on each
   software metering server.

10. Double-click Vfp_pack.Exe.

11. Wait for Vfp_pack.Exe to complete maintenance on the software metering
   tables.

12. You need to run Vfp_pack.exe on each software metering server in your site.

13. Using the SMS Service Manager, right-click LICENSE_METERING, and then click
   Start. Follow these same steps for the LICSVR_SERVICE.

14. Start the SMS_LICENSE_SERVER service on each software metering server after
   Vfp_pack has been run on each of them.

Increase the Frequency of Software Metering Table Maintenance
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. Edit RemOdbc.Ini on the site server and in the Software Metering folder
   (swmtr) on all software metering servers using any text editor.

2. Insert the following key in the [DS] section

   PackInterval=<seconds>

   where <seconds> represents how often (in seconds) you want maintenance
   performed on the software metering tables.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Systems Management Server 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Increasing the frequency of software metering table maintenance may have adverse
effects on system performance. Use this workaround with extreme caution.
