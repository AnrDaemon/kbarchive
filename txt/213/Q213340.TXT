TITLE   :SMS: Can't Open Membership Rules Tab at Child Site
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbMMC kbServer kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbCollections

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attach a site to a parent site that has a collection with an identical
name as a collection at the new child site, the collections are properly
replicated to the child site and may result in two identically named collections
being listed at the child site. However, when you click the Membership Rules tab
of either collection, you receive the following error message:

   This collection name is already in use. Please enter a different name.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because Microsoft Systems Management Server 2.0 enforces
uniqueness based on name. Note that this behavior does not occur for the default
collections installed by Systems Management Server.

WORKAROUND
==========

In this situation, Systems Management Server 2.0 prompts the user to fix the
name conflict. When the collection's Properties page is open, change either the
child site's collection name or the identical collection name at the parent
site.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 2.0.
