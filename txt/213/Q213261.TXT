SYMPTOMS
========

The Software Metering summary window in the Systems Management Server
Administrator Console does not show software usage for some clients.

CAUSE
=====

When the Systems Management Server client software for software metering is
installed on a client, and the date and time on the client is significantly
behind (earlier than) the current date and time of the site server, the client's
Software Metering Agent does not upload offline software usage logs to the
Software Metering server.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, follow these steps:

1. Remove the Systems Management Server software from the client.
