KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbClient kbConfig kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbAdvertisement kbPackage kbsmsInst kb

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) Installer script includes an
operation that requires an extended period of time to run, SMS may appear to
stop responding while this operation is taking place. No message box appears to
inform the user that the operation is running and to wait until it has been
completed.

CAUSE
=====

In SMS Installer, there are currently no script items available that can be used
to display a message box on the screen while another operation is being
performed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, follow these steps:

1. Use a graphics editor to create a bitmap image of the message dialog box that
   can be displayed during the operation.
2. Use a graphics editor to create another bitmap image with the same dimensions
   of (or smaller than) your message dialog box, and with the previous message
   removed.
3. Use SMS Installer's Script Editor to insert a Display Graphic action at the
   beginning of any script block that requires an extended period of time to
   run.
4. Edit this script item to display your message dialog box.
5. Insert a Display Graphic item at the end of the script block, this time
   specifying your second graphic image.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SMS Installer does not provide a script item to display a dialog box that can be
displayed and removed at the script editor's discretion. The Display Message
action is not effective in this scenario because it pauses the script until the
user clicks Yes, No, or Cancel.
