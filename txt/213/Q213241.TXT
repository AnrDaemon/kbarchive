TITLE   :SMS: Software-Metering Server Is Not Fully Uninstalled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0,2.0 SP1,2.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbServer kbsms200bug kbsmsMeter kbsms200preSP3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to uninstall a software-metering server, the uninstallation
process may not work. When this occurs, many of the software-metering server
components may remain on the server, and the partially-uninstalled server is
still listed in the software-metering database tables for the site. Also,
License Server Manager will continually try to uninstall the software-metering
server, and you can view this in the Licsvcfg.log file in the \SMS\Logs folder
on the site server.

CAUSE
=====

The two most common causes of this problem are:

 - The LicMtr share has been removed from the software-metering server before it
   is uninstalled.

 - The share that contains the software-metering database files is removed
   before you try the uninstallation process.

Under either of the preceding conditions, License Server Manager may try to
continuously uninstall the server.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 2.0. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do not remove the LicMtr share or the share that
contains the software-metering database files on a software-metering server
before you uninstall that server.
