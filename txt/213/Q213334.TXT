======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view the results of the All Systems By System Name report, you may
notice that all computers report only one network adapter even though some of
the reported computers have more than one network adapter installed. You may
also note that the Internet Protocol (IP) address reported can be from either
network adapter rather than consistently coming from one or the other (either
the first or the second network adapter).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Crystal Reports included with
Microsoft Systems Management Server 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Crystal Reports is offered with Systems Management Server 2.0 to provide a
method of reporting information regarding the site hierarchy. Crystal Reports
offers the ability to create your own reports yet also provides many reports by
default. Crystal Reports is a product offered and supported by Seagate
Technology.
