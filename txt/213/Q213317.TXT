SUMMARY
=======

Batch programs, in Systems Management Server (SMS), may not execute properly
when the following are true:

 - The 'Start in' directory of the program is a universal naming convention
   (UNC) path.

 - The drive mode is set to 'Run with UNC name'.

This occurs more often with 16-bit operating systems because they cannot use a
UNC path as their current working directory. 32-bit operating systems default to
%windir% as the current working directory.

To ensure proper execution of a batch program whose 'Start in' directory is a UNC
path, set the Drive mode to require a drive letter or a specific drive letter.

Additional query words: prodsms batch UNC
