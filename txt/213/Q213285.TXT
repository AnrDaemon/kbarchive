The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Systems Management Server 2.0 clients authenticate to a NetWare Bindery server.
The NetWare server must be configured as a Systems Management Server CAP and
logon point. The client will specify this NetWare server as the preferred server
when logging on to NetWare in order to correctly report its inventory to the SMS
site server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the preferred server is anything other than the one defined as the SMS login
point, then the smsls.scr will not execute because it is appended to the bindery
system logon script (net$log.dat) on the defined preferred server in the
following manner:

   "include sys:\smslogon\config\smsls.scr"

The client would be logging on to a bindery server that does not have this
statement appended to its login script (net$log.dat).

Additional query words: prodsms NW netware prefered server system logon script
