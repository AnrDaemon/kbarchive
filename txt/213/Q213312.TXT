======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When SMSMan.exe is executed by the Available Programs Manager (APM) using the /Q
switch, C++ Runtime Errors may be experienced. If SMSMan.exe /Q is executed by
the APM an error dialog box appears on the user's screen.

This dialogue box will contain the following error:

   Runtime Error!
   Program:
   \\<ServerName>\<PackageShare>\<PackageID>\SMSMan.exe

   abnormal program termination

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Executing SMSMAN /Q manually, or outside of APM does not produce this error.
The C++ Runtime Error occurs when /Q is the only switch specified. Using /Q in
combination with another switch does not produce the error.

For a complete list of command switches run SMSMAN /?.
