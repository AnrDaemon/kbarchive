-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 allows use of either (or both)
the TP0/X.25, TP4/CLNP transports. This article explains how to set up the
TP0/X.25 transport in the EiconCard Server mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With this configuration, the EiconCard and OSI LAN Gateway software are both
installed on a PC. This PC, acting as an EiconCard server, is used to run the
X.400 gateway. The EiconCard is also shared out for other systems to use the
EiconCard Redirector to connect to the EiconCard.

To use this configuration:

 - On the Gateway PC, install the EiconCard and the OSI LAN Gateway DOS GATEWAY
   software.

 - In the Gateway PC, modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to set up the computer as an
   EiconCard server.

The following example shows part of the AUTOEXEC.BAT file for a Gateway PC that
is an EiconCard server, servicing other redirector PCs on a Microsoft Compatible
Network.

X25serv is the server name, MYPASS is the server password, and 12 is the maximum
number of workstation sessions.

   REM Starting LAN Manager
   NET START ...

   REM Starting X.25
   NABIOS SRV x25serv MYPASS/12
   ECLOAD

On a Novell NetWare Network using Microsoft MS-DOS version 5.0 is installed and
NetBIOS is to be run.

   REM Starting Novell with NETBIOS emulation
   IPX
   NET5
   NETBIOS

   REM Starting X.25
   NABIOS SRV x25serv MYPASS/12
   ECLOAD

Here is an example showing the same configuration, except that NetBIOS is not
present:

   REM Starting Novell without NetBIOS emulation
   IPX
   NET5

   REM Starting X.25
   NABIOS SPX SRV x25serv MYPASS/12
