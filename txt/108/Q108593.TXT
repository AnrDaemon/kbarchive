-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator for MS-DOS, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you select the VESA 1.2 Compatible Display option from the Flight
Simulator Setup program, the following message may appear when starting the
program:

   Fatal error has occurred!
   Filename : SVGA.GRA
   Error code: 0000


The program will then clear the screen and return to the MS-DOS prompt.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, install a VESA 1.2 driver that supports the video card
or run the Setup program from the Flight Simulator directory (FLTSIM5 by
default) and select VGA as the display option.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The VESA (Video Electronics Standards Association) video standard is a reference
to a high-resolution video display that may be called. That is, Super VGA
(SVGA), VGA-plus, VGA-1024, or extended VGA.

The video card may come with VESA support built into the BIOS (in which case, the
error message would not occur) or a VESA 1.2 driver may come with the video card
that is installed by either the AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS files.

See your card's documentation for exact details. VESA 1.2 drivers that may work
with the card in question may be obtained from some electronic bulletin boards.
Check with your card's manufacturer for more information.
