SUMMARY
=======

The sample code below forces the main FoxPro window to remain on top of all
other windows. It demonstrates how to use the FOXTOOLS.FLL library commands to
call the SetWindowPos() Microsoft Windows application programming interface
(API) function.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The program first declares some compile-time constants (to improve readability)
and loads the FOXTOOLS.FLL library that is supplied with FoxPro for Windows. It
then retrieves the handle to the main FoxPro window using a call to MainHWND(),
which is a function residing in the FOXTOOLS.FLL library. It then calls the
SetWindowPos() function and passes the handle to the main FoxPro window and the
HWND_TOPMOST constant to make sure that window always remains on top.

      *** Define compile-time constants
      #DEFINE HWND_TOPMOST -1
      #DEFINE HWND_NOTOPMOST -2
      #DEFINE SWP_NOSIZE 1
      #DEFINE SWP_NOMOVE 2

      *** Load FoxTools library
      SET LIBRARY TO SYS(2004)+"FOXTOOLS"

      *** Register the Windows API function
      setwin=RegFn("SetWindowPos","IIIIIII","I")

      *** Obtain handle to main FoxPro window
      handle=mainhwnd()

      *** Call SetWindowPos() API function
      =CallFn(setwin,handle,HWND_TOPMOST,0,0,0,0,SWP_NOMOVE+SWP_NOSIZE)

      *** Release the FoxTools library
      SET LIBRARY TO

In order to remove the "always on top" attribute from the main FoxPro window, the
program above could be modified to make the CallFn() line use the constant
HWND_NOTOPMOST instead of HWND_TOPMOST as the third argument.
