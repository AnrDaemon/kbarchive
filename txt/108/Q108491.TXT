TITLE   :Writer 1: Upside Down Pages Not Dithered
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Kids Products

KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Upside down "Spletters" (special text created using the Shape tool) are not
dithered (shaded) when you print them. In other words, they print out only in
black and white, not in shades of gray or colors.

You are most likely to notice this problem when you are printing cards. (Some of
the pages on cards are printed upside down, so that they will be right-side-up
when you fold them.)

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Creative Writer version 1.0 1.1
and 1.1a. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Normally, the dithering is done by the printer. Upside down pages, however, are
sent to the printer as bitmaps, which cannot be modified by the printer.
Printers can't dither bitmaps.
