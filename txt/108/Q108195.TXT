Private-Storage.

RESOLUTION

The problem can be resolved by restoring the files from backup to the path
specified under Options, Folders, Private-Storage. If a backup copy is not
available, the administrator will have to reset Folder privileges for the user.
This is done from the Admin program by going into Local_Admin, Folders, Reset
and choosing the user from the list. This will delete all references to the old
folders, so the folders can be rebuilt from scratch.
