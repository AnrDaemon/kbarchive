TITLE   :FIX: Error F1001 in range.c Compiling with -Ox
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbCompiler kbFL32 kbFortranPS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to compile a program, using the -Ox option, that contains an GOTO
statement in combination with the INCLUDE may fail with the following error
message:

   fatal error F1001: INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR
   (compiler file '@(#)range.c:1.0', line 2279)

CAUSE
=====

The INCLUDE file contains an array on the left side of an assignment statement,
and the array is not declared. Because undeclared arrays appear as functions to
the compiler, the following error message should have been generated:

   error F2515: left side of assignment illegal

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure all arrays are properly declared.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation
32 for Windows NT, version 1.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft
PowerStation 32, version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following program illustrates the problem:
