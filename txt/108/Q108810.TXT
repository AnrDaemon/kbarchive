The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Messaging Application Program Interface (MAPI), the
MAPISaveMail operation allows you to create a message with an invalid date in
the format: YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM.

Example of invalid date: 9999/99/99 99:99

Copying a message with an invalid date to another folder delays opening the
folder because the invalid date causes a rebuild of the folder.


Additional query words: 3.00 3.20
