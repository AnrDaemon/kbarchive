The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator for MS-DOS, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a startup (boot) disk using FSSYSTEM.EXE, and then start your
computer using that disk, your system may stop responding (hang) if you are
running MS-DOS 6.0 and have an earlier or incompatible version of MOUSE.COM.

MOUSE.COM is copied from your hard drive to drive A when you make the startup
disk using the FSSYSTEM.EXE program. The mouse driver is loaded by the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file during startup. FSSYSTEM searches all directories in your PATH
and copies the latest version of the mouse driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Remove the following line from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file on drive A:

      lh a:\mouse

   NOTE: If you choose this option, your mouse will not function in Flight
   Simulator.

   -or-

2. Copy an updated version of MOUSE.COM to drive A.
