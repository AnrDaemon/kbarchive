SUMMARY
=======

The dmPaperSize member of the DEVMODE structure is documented incorrectly. The
documentation states that the dmPaperSize member may be set to zero if the
length and width of the paper are specified by the dmPaperLength and
dmPaperWidth members, respectively. However, the correct value to use for
user-defined paper sizes is DMPAPER_USER.

DMPAPER_USER is correctly listed in the Microsoft Windows 3.1 SDK documentation
as meaning a user-defined paper size, but is completely omitted from the
Microsoft Windows 3.0 SDK documentation.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.10 4.00
