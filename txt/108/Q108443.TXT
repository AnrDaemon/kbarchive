======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
 - Microsoft Fine Artist for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you change printers in the Chooser and do not return to Creative Writer
Printing Options to reset the settings for the new printer, your document prints
strangely.

For example, text or graphics may print either enlarged or squished, or may
overlap each other or hang over the margins.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, follow these steps:

1. In Creative Writer, press and hold down the SHIFT and COMMAND keys, while you
   press the A key (SHIFT+COMMAND+A) to switch to the Control Room.

2. From the File menu, click Printing Options.

3. Choose either Set Local (if you are setting printer options for only your own
   installation of Creative Writer) or Set Global (if you are setting options
   for all Creative Writer users on a network).

4. Make sure that the printer name in the upper left corner of the dialog box is
   the printer you want to use. Set your printing options as desired, and click
   OK.

5. In the next dialog box that appears, click Print or OK.

6. From the File menu, choose Return to Creative Writer.

Your document should print correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you switch printers on a Macintosh, the System gives you a message
instructing you to choose Page Setup in all open applications. In Creative
Writer, the printer setup menu is called Printing Options, not Page Setup.
Setting the options in this menu, however, achieve the results.
