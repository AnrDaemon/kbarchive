Note the following adjustments:

 - The amount of memory should be 560K conventional and 2 MB expanded or
   extended to view all elements.

 - The program requires approximately 10 MB of free hard disk space to install.
   Once installation is completed, the files use approximately 8.6 MB of disk

Stacker, and so on. You may have to make more space available. The files are
already compressed and many will not compress further.
