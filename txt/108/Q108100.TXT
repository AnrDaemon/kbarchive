TITLE   :PC-NFS Error: NFS903F Missing or Invalid PROTOCOL.INI Data
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using Sun Select's PC-NFS with Windows for Workgroups 3.11, you may receive
the following error message upon executing the PC-NFS files in the AUTOEXEC.BAT
file:

   NFS903F Missing or invalid PROTOCOL.INI data.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when the PC-NFS protocol is bound to more than one network
card in the PROTOCOL.INI file. PC-NFS allows for only one binding. Windows for
Workgroups 3.11, when installed on a machine with more than one network card,
adds the PC-NFS protocol to all network adapters listed in the PROTOCOL.INI
file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To eliminate this error message, the PC-NFS protocol should be removed from all
but one of the network cards listed in PROTOCOL.INI. To do this, use the
following steps:

1. If Windows for Workgroups fails to start after receiving the error message at
   startup, start Windows with the following command:

   win /n

   This starts Windows for Workgroups 3.11 without loading the network drivers.

2. Double-click the Network Setup icon in the Network group, then choose the
   Drivers button.

3. Locate the network adapter(s) to which you do NOT want to bind the PC- NFS
   protocol. Select PC-NFS Protocol under each of these listed adapters and then
   choose Remove.

4. Choose OK, and allow Windows for Workgroups to make all suggested changes to
   your configuration files. Once this is done, reboot the machine.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
as it becomes available.
