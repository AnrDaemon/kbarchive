SYMPTOMS
========

Some of the animations in Art Gallery may appear to already have been played.
When you switch to the dialog box or window containing the animation, the
animation is in the already-played state.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Art Gallery version 1.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

When the dialog box containing the animation appears, simply press Play. Art
Gallery refreshes the screen and plays the animation.
