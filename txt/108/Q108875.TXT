SUMMARY
=======

In a network where you are seeding the network and are running Windows NT
Advanced Server Services for Macintosh, be very cautious of the order in which
the network hardware is initialized. A device, such as the Shiva NetModem, which
has the capability of seeding a AppleTalk network can keep other seed routing
devices on the network from seeding properly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

One problem that may occur is when your whole network is powered down, but a
seeding device, such as the Shiva NetModem, is left running or is powered on
first. This causes other seed routers on the network to see that the NetModem is
seeding the network. They then gather the seed information that the NetModem is
sending out, which may or may not have the correct network zones or network
ranges created. The result of this is that other seed routers on the network do
not start unless their seed routing information matches the Shiva NetModem's
seed routing information. To keep this from happening, make sure that the device
that has the correct seed routing information for your network is powered on
first.

The Shiva product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of
