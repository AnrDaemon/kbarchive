TITLE   :FIX: Carriage Control 1 Prints an Ankh Symbol to Screen
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortrankbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using a carriage control of 1 when writing to the screen prints an Ankh symbol.
The appropriate output should be a blank line.

CAUSE
=====

The ASCII form-feed character (decimal 12) is displayed as an Ankh symbol. The
symbol is not being backspaced over as documented.

RESOLUTION
==========

The 1 carriage control is not supposed to function when writing to the screen
(see page 99 of the "Programmer's Guide"). Because it performs no function,
don't use it.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation
32 for Windows NT, version 1.0. This problem was fixed in Fortran PowerStation
for Windows NT, Version 1.0 with the release of Windows NT, Version 3.51, and in
Fortran PowerStation 32, version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample code illustrates the symptoms described above:

Sample Code
-----------

   C Compile options needed: none

         end
