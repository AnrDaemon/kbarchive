SYMPTOMS
========

If you print a multi-page banner on an Apple ImageWriter II or ImageWriter LQ,
there may be a gap in the middle of any letter that crosses a page break.

For example, on a banner that says "congratulations" and covers two pages, the
letter "u" may be cut in half by a bar of white space along the perforation
between the two sheets of paper.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, follow these steps:

1. Press "COMMAND+SHIFT+A" (without the quotation marks) to switch to the
   Control Room.

2. From the File menu, choose Printing Options.

3. Choose Set Local.

4. Select the option "No Gaps Between Pages" and choose OK.

The banner should now print correctly, with the letter printing continuously
across the perforation in the tractor-fed paper.

By default, this option is turned off.

NOTE: Keep orientation on portrait, otherwise you get gaps.
