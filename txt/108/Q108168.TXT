TITLE   :PRB: "No Label Layouts Found" Message When Creating a Label
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2x,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2x 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The FoxPro for Windows resource file (by default FOXUSER.DBF and its associated
memo file, FOXUSER.FPT) contains label layouts used by the Label Writer. If this
information is deleted or damaged, the following error occurs when you try to
create a label:

   No label layouts found

RESOLUTION
==========

To restore the label layout information, do one of the following:

FoxPro 2.x
----------

1. Make sure a resource file is in use.

   NOTE: To check this, choose About FoxPro from the Help menu, then choose the
   Next button. This dialog box displays the current resource file.
   Alternatively, you can use the SYS(2005) function to display the current
   resource file.

2. Run ADDLABEL.APP from the FOXPROW\GOODIES\MISC subdirectory. Make sure that
   the Add Label Layouts dialog box displays the correct resource file, then
   choose the Add Labels button.

   NOTE: If the FOXPROW\GOODIES\MISC subdirectory does not exist on your hard
   disk, run the ALLUNPAK.BAT file from an MS-DOS prompt. The ALLUNPAK.BAT file,
   which resides in the FOXPROW\GOODIES subdirectory, creates several
   subdirectories under FOXPROW\GOODIES, including the MISC subdirectory.

   If the ALLUNPAK.BAT file is not on your hard disk, you can install it by
   selecting the Other Sample Code And Goodies option from the Custom Install
   selection screen during FoxPro setup.

Visual FoxPro
-------------

NOTE: You may have to rename the resource files (Foxuser.dbf and Foxuser.fpt by
default) before using this resolution.

1. Run the Addlabel.app application in main Visual FoxPro directory.

2. In the Addlabel dialog box, select the appropriate Resource file, and then
   click Add Labels to Resource File.
