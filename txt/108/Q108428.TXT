======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the NET START command, you receive one of the following error
messages:

   Error 3: The specified path was not found. An error occurred accessing the
   security settings file.

   -or-

   Error 2625: WFWSYS.CFG is Invalid.

CAUSE
=====

These errors can be caused by one or both of the following situations:

 - The DEVDIR= line in the [network drivers] section of the SYSTEM.INI file is
   set to a directory different from the directory where the WFWSYS.CFG file is
   located.

   If DEVDIR= points to the directory where the WFWSYS.CFG is located and you
   still receive one of these error messages, you may have a damaged WFWSYS.CFG
   file, or your WFWSYS.CFG file was copied from another computer. In this case,
   you must reinstall Windows for Workgroups 3.11 or contact your system
   administrator.


 - You are running a shared copy of Windows for Workgroups on a Novell NetWare
   network and your Windows directory is set as a map root (for example,
   U:\<UserName>\Windows).

RESOLUTION
==========

 - To correct this problem, change the DEVDIR line so that it points to the
   correct location of the WFWSYS.CFG file.

 - Change the map root from the Windows directory to your user directory (for
   example, U:\<UserName>).
