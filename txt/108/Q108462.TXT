TITLE   :FIX: Concatenation in Parentheses Produces Blank Output
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Concatenation in assignment statements fail when the character expression is
surrounded by parentheses. The result is a blank string.

RESOLUTION
==========

Because parentheses have no affect on the results of expressions involving
concatenation, do not use parentheses when performing string concatenation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0
for MS-DOS. This problem has been resolved with FORTRAN PowerStation maintenance
release version 1.0a for MS-DOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0 can be differentiated from the maintenance
release version 1.0a by invoking the linker. Typing "link32 | more" (without the
quotation marks) from \F32\BIN directory will show version 2.8 for FORTRAN
PowerStation version 1.0, and it will show version 1.0f for the maintenance
release version 1.0a.

To reproduce the problem create a program using the sample code When run, the
sample code below displays the following:

   <cat dogs> < >

Sample Code
-----------

   Compile options: None
         character a*4,b*4,c*8,d*8
         a = "cat"
         b = "dogs"
         c = a//b
         d = (a//b)
         print *, "<",c,">  <",d,">"
         end
