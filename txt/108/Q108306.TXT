SUMMARY
=======

A Windows Telephony application queries the service provider for device
capabilities via a call to lineGetDevCaps. The dwMaxRate member of the
LINEDEVCAPS structure indicates the digital data transmission rate of the bearer
mode. This field is intended to indicate the maximum data rate for bearer modes
that directly support DATA transmissions, such as LINEBEARERMODE_DATA or
LINEBEARERMODE_ALTSPEECHDATA.

If the service provider does not support a DATA bearer mode, it can set dwMaxRate
to 0 (zero) or use this field to indicate the maximum rate of data supported for
other bearer modes that it does support. For example, if LINEBEARERMODE_VOICE is
supported by a service provider that also supports LINEMEDIAMODE_DATAMODEM,
dwMaxRate could indicate the maximum modem baud rate available for the line.
However, if both DATAMODEM and DATA are available on the same line (for example,
an ISDN adapter with a digital modem), then dwMaxRate would indicate the maximum
LINEBEARERMODE_DATA rate.
