SUMMARY
=======

Vversions 2.1, 3.0, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 provide two
options for separating address attributes:

 - All address attributes may be separated by semicolons (;). For example:

   c=US;a=TELENET;p=ABC;o=P/Q;g=JOHN;s=STEEL

 - All address attributes may be separated by a forward slash (/). A leading
   forward slash is also required at the beginning of the O/R name. If a forward
   slash is part of an address attribute, the forward slash must be preceded by
   the escape character ($) and is entered as $/. For example:

   /c=US/a=TELENET/p=ABC/o=P$/Q/g=JOHN/s=STEEL
