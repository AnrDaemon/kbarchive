======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article demonstrates how you can determine if an error you are receiving
from a Visual Basic program is a Visual Basic trappable error or if it coming
from another source.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you run the VB.exe file, follow these steps to get more information on a
specific error:

1. Stop your program if it is currently running.

2. Press the F8 key to go from design mode to break mode.

3. Press CTRL+B to activate the debug window.

4. Enter the following statement and wait for the error message to appear:

"Error <error-number>" (without the quotation marks)

For example, type "Error 70" (without the quotation marks), and the following
error message appears:

   Permission denied

5. Press F1 to get information from Help on that specific error.

   For example, pressing F1 on "Error 70" (without the quotation marks) displays
   the Permission denied page from the Visual Basic Help.

To generate a list of error messages for Visual Basic 3.0:

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a Label control (Label1) and a CommandButton (Command1) to Form1. Set the
   Label1 Caption property to Status of Error List.

3. Add the following code to the Click event for Command1:

      Dim i As Variant
      Dim buf As String
      Label1.Caption = "Error List Started"
      For i = 1 To &H7FFF
        If Error$(i) <> "User-defined error" Then
          buf = buf & Format$(i, "@@@@ ") & Error$(i) & Chr$(13) & Chr$(10)
        End If
      Next
      ClipBoard.Clear
      ClipBoard.SetText buf
      Label1.Caption = "Error List Complete"

4. On the Run menu, choose Start, or press the F5 key to run the program. Click
   Command1 and, when the label displays the following error message, then paste
   the contents of the clipboard into an editor, such as Notepad:

   Error List Complete
