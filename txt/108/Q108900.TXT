TITLE   :How to Return After F8 into a C Run-Time Library Function
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDebug kbide

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Visual Workbench Integrated Debugger, used with:
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When stepping into (F8) a C run-time library function in the Visual Workbench
integrated debugger, the debugger displays the following error message:

   There is no source line debugging information.

The error repeats when single stepping through the library function using the
Step Over command (F10). To avoid the error, exit the C run-time library
function by choosing Step Out from the Visual Workbench Debug menu (SHIFT+F7).

NOTE: This does not happen in later versions of Visual C++ 32-bit Edition.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The C run-time libraries provided with the Visual Workbench are not built with
debugging information. When debugging in mixed source and assembly mode,
stepping into one of the library functions via Step Into (F8) causes the
debugger to display the "no debugging information" message. Once inside the
run-time library code, the debugger continues to display the message for each
step inside the library function code until the run-time library code is exited.
This is expected behavior for the Visual Workbench debugger.

To leave the run-time library function, choose Step Out or the equivalent
(SHIFT+F7) from the Debug menu. Step Out returns to the first instruction after
the call to the run-time library function.
