The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows for Workgroups 3.11 includes support for Novell NetWare connectivity
using the Novell NetWare ODI workstation configuration files (including
LSL.COM). If you are using this configuration with a version of the Berkeley
Systems MS-DOS-based screen saver After Dark earlier than 2.0, you may encounter
problems.

Early versions of the screen saver terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program,
AD-DOS.COM versions 1.0x, do not load if the Novell NetWare LSL.COM file has
been loaded first. LSL.COM does load after AD-DOS.COM, however, this may cause
unreliable network functionality and application performance.

The AD-DOS.COM file included with After Dark version 2.0 does not appear to
generate these properties. For more information, contact Berkeley Systems
Technical Support.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If LSL.COM is loaded into memory first, it occupies INT 2f/CO; when AD-DOS.COM
detects that this interrupt is in use, it fails to load. The following message
is displayed when the AD-DOS.COM TSR program cannot load:

   Another TSR is currently using our ID code.

If AD-DOS.COM loads first, LSL.COM loads without generating an error message.
LSL.COM may then pass calls to AD-DOS.COM, which may return inappropriate values
and cause network applications to fail to detect the presence of LSL.COM or
otherwise cause the applications to receive unreliable information (such as
pointers to information structures) from LSL.COM.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
or reliability.
