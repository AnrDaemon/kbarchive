The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Art Gallery for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you perform a search for information that appears in several different places
in Art Gallery, the list of titles found doesn't differentiate between the
entries.

For example, if you search on the word "Madonna," the resulting list includes
twelve separate instances of the title "The Madonna and Child with Saints."
However, the list doesn't indicate which sections of Art Gallery the twelve
different instances of this painting or paintings are in.

The Art Gallery Find list also doesn't differentiate between similar painting
names, such as "Modonna and Child with Saints John the Baptist and Catherine of
Alexandria," and "Madonna and Child with Saints James the Greater, Jerome, the
Infant Baptist, and Catherine of Alexandria." These painting names are both
simply shortened to "the Madonna and Child with Saints."

RESOLUTION
==========

To narrow down your search, choose the Refine Search button and add another
search word to your query. This searches only on the list you have already
found.
