SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Exabyte 8200-EXB (SCSI-1 device) and backing up files
with NTBACKUP, NTBACKUP stops after processing less than 1.5 megabyte (MB) of
data. NTBACKUP displays the following error message:

   Fatal error 1.

The Event log contains the following message from the Service Control Manager:

   \Device\ScsiPort0 timed out.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Exabyte 8200-EXB can be configured for SCSI disconnects on even or odd byte
boundaries. In order to operate properly with NTBACKUP, the streamer should be
configured to disconnect on even boundary.

Configuration of the streamer is controlled by 8 dip-switches. Switch 3
determines the SCSI disconnects. In order for NTBACKUP to operate correctly,
switch 3 should be set On (Even boundary).

Detailed explanation of the dip-switches:

SW  Default value (Off)            Optional Value (On)
