======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you create a new directory on drive B using Norton Desktop for Windows
(NDW), the NDW File Manager may display the newly created directory on both
drives B and C.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you have configured NDW to view collapsible trees (by
choosing Use Collapsible Tree from the Tree menu) and you have windows for both
drives B and C visible on the screen simultaneously. If the C window is not
visible, it is refreshed by the time you display it and will not show the
incorrect directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can work around this situation by choosing to update the display. For more
information on this problem, contact Symantec Technical Support.
