TITLE   :Server Fails, Internal Processing Error RMN:SFT LCK
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

A LAN Manager file server being used as an MS-Mail 3.X post office can fail with
this error message:

   Internal Processing Error

followed by a memory location in the form 0220:59cb, 0220:5E56. If the OS/2
kernel debugger is installed, a second error message also is displayed on the
monitor of the failing system:

   RMN:SFT LCK Field not 0

This can occur during execution of a batch file that deletes the mail postoffice
share before backing it up. It can also occur if a user system is powered off
while a mail file still is open on the server. If the user immediately attempts
to open the mail file again, the locks may not have been properly cleaned up.

CAUSE
=====

Although a file was closed, the server did not close its file locks, causing a
problem with the system file table when the file was reopened.

RESOLUTION
==========

OS2KRNL has been fixed to detect the appropriate file locks and force them
closed.

STATUS
======

The fix is included in the latest update for LAN Manager 2.2b.
