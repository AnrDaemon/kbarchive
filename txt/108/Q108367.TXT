TITLE   :FIX: Columns 72 to 80 Not Displayed in Source Listing File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCompiler kbFL32 kbFortranPSkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When compiling with /Fs to produce a source listing file, characters in columns
72 and beyond are not propagated to the list file. Column 72 can always contain
a valid character. Columns 73 to 80 are valid columns for characters when using
$FREEFORM formatting.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation
32 for Windows NT, version 1.0. This problem was fixed in FORTRAN PowerStation
32, version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The listing file produced by compiling the program below will not display the
closing quotation mark of PRINT*, line:

Sample Code
-----------

   C Compile options needed: -Fs, also remove the continuation line so
   C the string constant is on the same line as the PRINT statement.
   C Knowledge Base articles cannot use columns past 70.

         print*,
        + 'the last single quote is trimmed off in the listing.....'
         end
