TITLE   :Application Log Full Dialog Box Appears Instead of Overwriting
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An Application Log Full dialog box incorrectly appears on the Application Log
screen of Event Viewer in the following situation:

1. You set Event Log Wrapping to Overwrite Events As Needed in the Event Log
   Settings dialog box.

2. The Application Log completely fills with events.

3. In the Control Panel window, choose the Date/Time icon, and then set the time
   back a few minutes.

4. Immediately log more events to the Application Log.

The Application Log Full dialog box appears. This should not happen because you
have set the Application Log to Overwrite Events As Needed.

CAUSE
=====

The Application Log Full dialog box incorrectly appears in this situation
because Event Log does not continue to overwrite log files based on the time
difference.

STATUS
======

Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem has been corrected in Windows NT
Workstation and Windows NT Server version 3.5. This problem has also been
