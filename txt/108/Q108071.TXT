PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbprogramming

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When an APPC application issues WinAPPCCancelAsyncRequest() after the
asynchronous routine has completed, WAPPCINVALID (0xF001) is returned instead of
WAPPCALREADY (0xF000). The SNA Server APPC Programmer's Guide states that
WAPPCALREADY should be returned in this instance.

CAUSE
=====

WinAPPCCancelAsyncRequest is not properly returning the WAPPCALREADY error code
as documented.

RESOLUTION
==========

An update to SNA Server 2.11 corrects this problem, so that
WinAPPCCancelAsyncRequest now returns WAPPCALREADY if an asynchronous routine is
being cancelled has already completed.

Microsoft has updated the following files to correct this problem:

   Windows NT:  <snaroot>\SYSTEM\WAPPC32.DLL
   Windows 95:  <win95root>\SYSTEM\WAPPC32.DLL
   Windows 3.x: <winroot>\SYSTEM\WINAPPC.DLL

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
