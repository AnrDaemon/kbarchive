The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a 
 - Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The cell-shading patterns from the Format Patterns Pattern dialog box in
Microsoft Excel may print at 300 dots per inch (dpi) to Hewlett-Packard (HP)
LaserJet 4-series and 5-series printers using the HPPCL5E.DRV driver, even
though the driver is set for 600 dpi.

This problem has been reproduced with HPPCL5E.DRV versions 1.18, 1.20, and 1.26.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Format the cells for a solid shading pattern and choose a shade of gray for
   the foreground color. This type of shading prints correctly at 600 dpi.

-or-

 - Place some type of graphic on each page of the worksheet. This forces
   Microsoft Excel to print the shading patterns at 600 dpi. An empty Microsoft
   Draw object can be used.

STATUS
======

Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard are researching this problem and will post more
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
