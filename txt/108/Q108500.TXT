TITLE   :WD97: Envelope Command Fails to Pick Up Print Merge Addrs Fields
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbualink97 kbmerge kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Word for Windows, if you create a mail merge main document, and then choose
Envelopes And Labels from the Tools menu, the envelope dialog box does not pick
up some or all of the merge fields, even if they are selected.

CAUSE
=====

There is a limit to the number of characters the envelope dialog box can
support. If the address the envelope feature is trying to read has too many
characters, the envelope dialog box will appear blank or will not display all of
the address lines.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.

Method 1: Shorten length of fields
----------------------------------

Shorten the length of the print merge fields.

Method 2: Add envelope to document
----------------------------------

Add the envelope to the mail merge main document and then copy and paste the
address print merge fields from the document to the envelope, or use the Insert
Merge Field button to add the address merge fields to the envelope.

Method 3: Directly insert fields
--------------------------------

In the Envelopes and Labels dialog box, press CTRL+F9 to insert the field braces
and then type the field names.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the versions of Word listed at
the beginning of this article.
