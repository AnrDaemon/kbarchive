TITLE   :PC DB: Import Does Not Send Welcome Message to New Users
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The IMPORT.EXE program in version 3.2 Microsoft Mail allows batch creation of
users, but users created in this way do not receive a welcome message from the
administrator.

CAUSE
=====

Only users created from the ADMIN.EXE program receive a welcome message.

This is by design. The Import program does not contain the Mailer code to
generate messages and hence does not send out mail to the new users.

RESOLUTION
==========

The welcome message received by users is present in the file WELCOME.GLB. You
can edit this file to contain a custom welcome message.

If you want to use the Import program to create new users and still have them
receive a welcome message, use the Messaging Application Program Interface
(MAPI) to write a custom application that determines new users' names by reading
the input file used by IMPORT.EXE, then sends them a message with the
MAPISendMail function. You can find more information on MAPI in the Microsoft
Mail for PC Networks "Technical Reference."
