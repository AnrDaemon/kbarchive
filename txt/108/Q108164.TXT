The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a table in a query (.QPR) file cannot be found, the Relational Query By
Example (RQBE) tool loads the remaining (found) tables in the query, but doesn't
generate the FROM clause unless the table set is modified (using ADD or CLEAR).

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code demonstrates this behavior. It creates two tables (databases)
and creates a query based on them. It then deletes one of the tables and reopens
the query. This second time, the FROM list will have been removed from the SQL
statement.

      ERASE TBLTEST.QPR
      CLOSE ALL
      SET SAFETY OFF

      CREATE TABLE tbl1 (keyfield c(3))
      INSERT INTO tbl1 (keyfield) VALUES ("AAA")
      INSERT INTO tbl1 (keyfield) VALUES ("BBB")
      INSERT INTO tbl1 (keyfield) VALUES ("CCC")

      SELECT 0

      CREATE TABLE tbl2 (keyfield c(3))
      INSERT INTO tbl2 (keyfield) VALUES ("BBB")
      INSERT INTO tbl2 (keyfield) VALUES ("BBB")
      INSERT INTO tbl2 (keyfield) VALUES ("BBB")
      INSERT INTO tbl2 (keyfield) VALUES ("CCC")
      INSERT INTO tbl2 (keyfield) VALUES ("CCC")
      INSERT INTO tbl2 (keyfield) VALUES ("AAA")

      SELECT tbl1

      WAIT WINDOW "This will now create the query.  Please add TBL2 to the"
      WAIT WINDOW "query as well as the field TBL2.KEYFIELD.  View the SQL"
      WAIT WINDOW "(noticing the FROM line), RUN it and then save"
      WAIT WINDOW "and close it."

      CREATE QUERY tbltest

      SELECT tbl2
      USE
      DELETE FILE tbl2.dbf
      SELECT tbl1

      WAIT WINDOW "I've now deleted the table.  When the RQBE Window "
      WAIT WINDOW "attempts to open again, press Cancel when prompted to"
      WAIT WINDOW "find the TBL2 file.  Add TBL1.KEYFIELD back to the"
      WAIT WINDOW "fields list, and look under View SQL.  Notice that the"
      WAIT WINDOW "list of tables and fields is no longer in the SELECT"
      WAIT WINDOW "Statement."
      MODIFY QUERY tbltest
