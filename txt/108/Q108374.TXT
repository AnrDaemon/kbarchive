The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.0 of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP displays the memory available
to the log file or the Gateway PC screen in the following line:

   Idling: 48452 bytes, largest 47428

This means that, in conventional memory, after the Gateway has loaded, there are
48452 bytes available, and the largest contiguous space is 47428 bytes. These
numbers vary depending on whether the TCP/IP and networking software are loaded
high.

NOTE: SMTPGATE.EXE must be executed with a -Cd parameter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Gateway code determines the memory available by calling two C library
routines:

_MEMAVL for the available memory
_MEMMAX for the largest contiguous space.

Additional query words: 3.00
