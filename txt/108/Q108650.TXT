TITLE   :Flight Simulator 5.0 Err Msg: EMM386.EXE Exception Error #12
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator for MS-DOS, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If POWER.EXE is installed, it may produce the error message:

   EMM386.EXE exception error #12

You may receive this error message or the system may stop responding (hang) when
you change airports or situations in Flight Simulator 5.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

"Exception error # 12" indicates a "Stack Overflow". Removing EMM386.EXE may
reveal the true error message; however, Flight Simulator 5.0 does not run very
well without it. Changing the Stacks= setting in the CONFIG.SYS to read

   Stacks=18,256

may correct this. The maximum size for the Stacks= setting is 64,512. The
presence of POWER.EXE in the CONFIG.SYS may also cause an "Exception error # 12"
error. Removing this line, and/or using a startup (boot) disk may also correct
this problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Power program (POWER.EXE) monitors keyboard polling and the Application Idle
interrupt to determine if a system is idle; it monitors use of the hard disk,
video functions, and MS-DOS functions to determine if a system is busy.

POWER.EXE may incorrectly determine that your machine is idle if you are using
communication programs, computationally intensive programs, or other programs
that infrequently access the hard disk. When POWER.EXE detects that the system
is idle, it halts or slows down the CPU, which adversely affects application
performance if your machine is not truly idle.
