TITLE   :Running SCANDISK /ALL While a Virtual Drive Exists
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2,6.21,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Running SCANDISK /ALL incorrectly scans virtual drives created using the SUBST
command.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the ScanDisk program included
with MS-DOS versions 6.2, 6.21, and 6.22. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you use drive A as a virtual drive (for example, by using the command SUBST
A: C:\DOS), running SCANDISK A: results in the following error message

   Drive A was created by using the SUBST or ASSIGN command and cannot be
   checked. To check drive A, run ScanDisk on drive C instead.

The error message recommends running ScanDisk on drive C because the physical
directory actually resides on C. This is normal.

If you run SCANDISK /ALL, ScanDisk actually diagnoses the virtual drive. While
this should not cause errors, Microsoft recommends that you not run SCANDISK
/ALL while a virtual drive exists.



Additional query words: 6.20 SCANDISK ALL SUBST
