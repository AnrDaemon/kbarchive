-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to log on to a Microsoft Windows NT or Microsoft LAN Manager domain
through Microsoft Windows for Workgroups, you may receive one of the following
error messages:

Windows for Workgroups 3.11
---------------------------

   No domain server was available to validate your password. You were logged on
   without password validation.

Windows for Workgroups 3.1
--------------------------

   No LAN Manager server was available to validate your password. You were
   logged on without password validation.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs if you entered the incorrect domain name, or there is a space
included in the Windows for Workgroups computer name.

Microsoft Windows NT supports computer names with spaces, but in order for
validation to occur, the computer name must appear in quotation marks. Windows
for Workgroups does not allow the user to input the computer name when you log
on; therefore, validation fails if you have a space included in your Windows for
Workgroups computer name. The answer to whether or not validation has taken
place never comes back.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, remove the space from the Windows for Workgroups
computer name.
