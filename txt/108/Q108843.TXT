TITLE   :PC Ext: Err Msg: Invalid Option Specified in .INI
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, the External Mail program
(EXTERNAL.EXE) may exit with the following error:

   Invalid option specified in .INI:

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused by a comment line that does not have a semicolon (;) in the
first column of the INI file, or does not follow a valid INI option. A comment
line of the form

   ; This is a comment
   ThisIsAValidOption     ; This is a comment

does not cause the error. A line of the form

             ; This is a comment

is incorrect and causes the error.

This error can also be caused by a corrupt .INI file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Place a semicolon in the first column of every comment line that does not follow
a valid INI option. Thus the line

   ;           This is a comment

is correct. Several sample configurations for the External Mail program in the
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks version 3.2 "Administrator's Guide" incorrectly
display comment lines. Any comment line that does not follow a valid INI option
must have a semicolon in the first column.

If you have double checked the .INI file and are certain that the entries are all
valid, try creating a new one. Do not copy and paste from the old one, instead
use Notepad or another ASCII editor and create a new .INI file.
