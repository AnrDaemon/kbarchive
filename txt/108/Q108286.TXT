TITLE   :FIX: Incorrect F2560 with Adjustable Sized Arrays and /4Yb
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Compiling an adjustable sized array with extended error handling (for example,
/4Yb), which uses an expression for a bound, incorrectly produces the following
error:

   error F2560: (array_name) : array bound used intrinsic call

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not use extended error handling when compiling adjustable sized arrays that
are dimensioned with an expression.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0
for MS-DOS. This problem has been resolved with FORTRAN PowerStation maintenance
release version 1.0a for MS-DOS.

FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0 can be differentiated from the maintenance
release version 1.0a by invoking the linker. Typing "link32 | more" (without the
quotation marks) from \F32\BIN directory will show version 2.8 for FORTRAN
PowerStation version 1.0, and it will show version 1.0f for the maintenance
release version 1.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The sample program below demonstrates the problem when compiled with FORTRAN
PowerStation:

Sample Code
-----------

   $debug
          SUBROUTINE TEST(N,X)
          INTEGER N
          REAL X((N+1)/2) ! Expression dimensions adjustable array X
          X((N+1)/2)=1
          RETURN
          END
