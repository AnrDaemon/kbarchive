======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Windows NT Advanced Server Services for Macintosh, AppleTalk cascades the
general rights down to each subfolder from the parent folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, if a file folder has the following rights

                          See          See           Make
                         Folder       Files         Changes

   --------------------------------------------------------
   Owner:  User1           X            X              X

   User\Group: Users       X            X              X

   Everyone                O            O              O

a different user who creates a folder within the above folder would receive the
following rights:

                          See          See           Make
                         Folder       Files         Changes

   --------------------------------------------------------
   Owner:  User2           X            X              X

   User\Group: Users       X            X              X

   Everyone                O            O              O

The owner of this new folder is now the new owner and thus this user now has full
rights to change the rights for any group that wants to access this folder (on
the Macintosh side). This can bring up some administration problems because an
administrator may want to give all rights of administration to a given folder's
owner for all subfolders. This is an issue related to AppleTalk functionality
rather than to Windows NT Advanced Server or LAN Manager rights.
