TITLE   :FIX: DX2010 w/ GETARG When RUNQQ Takes Five or more Arguments
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using RUNQQ to spawn an application that uses five or more command-line
arguments causes the spawned application to produce the following error when the
spawned application uses GETARG:

   DOSXMSF : error DX2010: invalid pointer passed to free or realloc

RESOLUTION
==========

Use SYSTEMQQ instead of RUNQQ to spawn programs using five or more command- line
arguments.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0
for MS-DOS. This problem has been resolved with FORTRAN PowerStation maintenance
release version 1.0a for MS-DOS.

FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0 can be differentiated from the maintenance
release version 1.0a by invoking the linker. Typing "link32 | more" from
\F32\BIN directory will show version 2.8 for FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0,
and it will show version 1.0f for the maintenance release version 1.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The sample programs that reproduce this problem are shown below (no compile
options for either program):

Sample Code #1 (Main Spawning Program)
--------------------------------------

    include 'flib.fi'
         include 'flib.fd'
         integer*4 result
         result=RUNQQ('test.exe','-a -b -c -d -e')
         write(*,*) 'result = ',result
         end

Sample Code #2 (TEST.EXE)
-------------------------

         character*40 buffer
         integer*2 j,status
         k=nargs()
         write(*,*) 'k = ',k
         do j=0,k-1
            call GETARG(j,buffer,status)
            write(*,*) buffer,status
         enddo
         end
