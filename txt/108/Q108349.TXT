TITLE   :BUG: Console I/O Problem; CR/LF Skipped After File Open
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, versions 1.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A console application that opens a file with a unit specifier of 5 may cause
subsequent screen output to appear on the same line (without carriage return and
linefeed characters).

CAUSE
=====

This problem seems to occur only when the application writes to the screen
before opening unit 5.

RESOLUTION
==========

If unit number 5 must be used for an external file, OPEN that file before
performing any WRITE statements to the screen. Running the program with MORE
piping (for example, | MORE) to display output one screen at a time also
alleviates the error.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation
32 for Windows NT, version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample program demonstrates the problem:

Sample Code
-----------

   C Compile options required: none
         character*12 buffer
         do i=5, 7
            write(buffer,'(i5,a)') i,'.dat'
            write(*,*) 'Filename is: ', buffer
            open(i,file=buffer)
         end do
         end

Output
------

Filename is:     5.dat   Filename is:     6.dat
Filename is:     7.dat

Additional query words: 1.00 4.00 handle
