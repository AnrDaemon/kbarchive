TITLE   :32-Bit File Access Cache Size Is Incorrectly Displayed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with 32-bit file access enabled and a
cache size over 9,984 kilobytes (K), the cache size displayed in the Virtual
Memory dialog box of Control Panel is truncated. (To see the cache size, choose
the 386 Enhanced icon in Control Panel, choose Virtual Memory, and then choose
the Change button.)

CAUSE
=====

This is a display error; the actual cache size is still the value that was
entered in the dialog box, provided sufficient physical RAM is available to
allocate to the cache.

Additional query words: 3.11 vfat
