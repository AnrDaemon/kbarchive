Workgroups 3.1, or WINSETUP.EXE from Windows for Workgroups 3.11) and try to add
or remove the Accessories group, WRITE.EXE is not included. This behavior is by
design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WRITE.EXE is considered part of the system because it is required to access the
"README" files (.WRI). It must be manually added or removed.

To add the Write icon to the Accessories group, use the following steps:

1. Open the Program Manager and choose Accessories from the Window menu.

2. From the File menu, choose New.

3. In the New Program Object dialog box, select New Item and choose OK.

4. In the Program Item Properties dialog box, enter the following information:

      Description: Write
      Command Line: <C:\WINDOWS>\WRITE.EXE
      Working Directory: <C:\WINDOWS>
      Shortcut Key: None (default)

   NOTE: Substitute the drive and directory that contains your Windows files for
   <C:\WINDOWS> in the above example.

5. Choose OK.

To remove the Write icon from the Accessories group, do the following:

1. Select the Write icon in the Accessories group and press the DEL key on your
   keyboard.

2. Choose Yes to confirm deletion of the Write program item.

3. Run File Manager and delete the files WRITE.EXE and WRITE.HLP from your
   Windows directory.

NOTE: You may also want to delete any files that end with the extension .WRI
since these are documents files in Write format.
