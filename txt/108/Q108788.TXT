MORE INFORMATION
================

Your Hard Disk Drive Is Not Compressed and You Want to Install

MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade
------------------

Run MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade Setup. For example, put MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade Setup Disk 1 in
drive A, type "a:setup" (without the quotation marks) at the IBM PC DOS command
prompt, and then press ENTER.

You Did Not Create an Uninstall Disk, Your Hard Disk Drive Is Not

Compressed, and You Want to Return to MS-DOS 6.0
------------------------------------------------

1. Use the MOVE command to change the C:\DOS directory to another name. For
   example, type "move c:\dos c:\pcdos" (without the quotation marks) at the
   MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

2. Run MS-DOS 6 Upgrade Setup. For example, put MS-DOS 6 Upgrade Setup Disk 1 in
   drive A, and type "a:setup" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS
   command prompt and then press ENTER.

3. After Setup is finished and has rebooted your system, delete the IBM PC DOS
   6.1 files and directory. For example, type "deltree /y c:\pcdos" (without the
   quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

You Did Not Create an Uninstall Disk, Your Hard Disk Drive Is Not

Compressed, and You Want to Install MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade
------------------------------------------------------

Put the MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade Setup Disk 1 in drive A and type "a:setup" (without
the quotation marks) at the IBM PC DOS 6.1 command prompt.

You Did Not Create an Uninstall Disk, Your Hard Disk Drive Is Not Compressed, and
You Want to Return to MS-DOS 6 Upgrade So That You Can Then Install MS-DOS 6.2
Step-Up)

1. Move the C:\DOS directory to another name. For example, type "move c:\dos
   c:\pcdos" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then
   press ENTER.

2. Run MS-DOS 6 Upgrade Setup. For example, put MS-DOS 6 Upgrade Setup Disk 1 in
   drive A, and type "a:setup" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS
   command prompt and then press ENTER.

3. After Setup is finished and has rebooted your system, delete the IBM PC DOS

   quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

4. Run MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up Setup. For example, put MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up Disk 1 in
   drive A, and type "a:setup" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS
   command prompt and then press ENTER.

Your Hard Disk Drive Is Compressed, Your System Does Not Have a Partition

Less Than 32 Megabytes, and You Want to Return to MS-DOS 6.0
------------------------------------------------------------

1. If you have enough free space, run SSUNCOMPRESS.EXE to remove the IBM PC DOS
   6.1 compression software.

   If you do not have enough free space, refer to the section of this article
   titled "Your Hard Drive Is Compressed, Your System Has a Partition Less Than
   32 Megabytes or Insufficient Free Space to Run SSUNCOMPRESS.EXE, and You Want
   to Return to MS-DOS 6.0."

2. Use the MOVE command to change the C:\DOS directory to another name. For
   example, type "move c:\dos c:\pcdos" (without the quotation marks) at the
   MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER. EX.

3. Run MS-DOS 6 Upgrade Setup. For example, put MS-DOS 6 Upgrade Setup Disk 1 in
   drive A, and type "a:setup" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS
   command prompt and then press ENTER.

4. After Setup is finished and has rebooted your system, delete the IBM PC DOS
   6.1 files and directory. For example, type "deltree /y c:\pcdos" (without the
   quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

NOTE: If you try to use your Uninstall disk and one or your drives is compressed,
your system will be left with an unusual configuration (that is, it will contain
two DOS systems). Your compressed volume file (CVF) gets modified whether or not
you chose to install SuperStor during the IBM PC DOS 6.1 installation. For this
reason, you must remove the compression software before returning to MS-DOS 6.0,
even if you have an Uninstall disk.

You Did Not Create an Uninstall Disk, Your Hard Disk Drive Is Compressed, Your
System Has a Partition Less Than 32 Megabytes or Insufficient Free

Space to Run SSUNCOMPRESS.EXE, and You Want to Return to MS-DOS 6.0.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

You must use the following procedure because the IBM PC DOS 6.1 SSUNCOMPRESS.EXE
fails (in the middle of the uncompress process) on a partition with less than 32
megabytes.

1. Back up your data on all the compressed drives.

2. Run SSTOR to determine which drives are compressed and which are not. Write
   this information down.

3. Restart your computer using your MS-DOS 6 Upgrade Setup Disk 1.

4. Press F5 when you see the "Starting MS-DOS..." prompt.

5. Type "format <drive>: /s" (without the quotation marks), where
   <drive> is the startup host drive. For example, "format h: /s."

6. Type "format <drive>:" (without the quotation marks) on all host
   drives, where <drive> is the host drive.

7. Run MS-DOS 6 Upgrade Setup. For example, put MS-DOS 6 Upgrade Setup Disk 1 in
   drive A, type "a:setup" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command
   prompt, and then press ENTER.

8. Type "dblspace" (without the quotation marks) to run DoubleSpace and compress
   drive C.

9. Run DoubleSpace again.

10. From the Tools menu, choose Compress.

11. Select the drives that were compressed under IBM PC DOS 6.1 and compress
   them.

12. Install the program you used to back up your data.

13. Restore your data.
