The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator for MS-DOS, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Flight Simulator 5.0 with a mouse and a Creative Labs SoundBlaster
Pro configured for Interrupt 2 (IRQ2), the Flight Simulator program will stop
responding (hang) when you use the mouse.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this, configure the sound card for a different interrupt. See the
Creative Labs manual for alternative interrupts.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem may not be specific to SoundBlaster sound cards. Other sound cards
or devices configured for IRQ2 may cause the same problem.

IRQ2 is reserved for the second Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) and is
not recommended for a sound card.
