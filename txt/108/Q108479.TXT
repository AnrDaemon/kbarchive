The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to access a connected network drive from the MS-DOS command prompt
using Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and Novell NetWare connectivity, you may
receive the following message:

   Extended Error 53

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs because the real-mode network, when running Novell
NetWare connectivity, cannot load the same protocols that load in 386 enhanced
mode Windows for Workgroups 3.11. Because the real-mode network is using the IPX
or IPXODI driver to communicate with the network adapter, it cannot load the
NDIS2 or NDIS3 protocols. However, it does allow communication with any Windows
for Workgroups 3.11 server running the IPX/SPX Compatible Transport or IPX/SPX
Compatible Transport with NetBIOS on the network.

It is not possible to access a Windows for Workgroups 3.1 server because it
cannot use the IPX/SPX compatible protocol. Communication with a Windows NT
server is also not possible because the real-mode network does not provide the
NetBIOS interface necessary to communicate with the Windows NT IPX/SPX
Compatible Transport.

If persistent connections are stored in Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and ghosted
connections are enabled, starting the real-mode network in MS-DOS will seem to
connect machines not running the IPX/SPX compatible protocol, including Windows
for Workgroups 3.1 and Windows NT servers. However, if you try to access files
or printers on these servers, you receive the error message "Extended Error 53."
This occurs because ghosted connections have been enabled in Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 and therefore no attempt is made to connect to the server when
the real-mode network is first started.


RESOLUTION
==========

Communication is not possible with a Windows for Workgroups 3.1 or Windows NT
server using the real-mode redirector in conjunction with Novell NetWare
connectivity. If you need to access another Windows for Workgroups 3.11 machine,
the computer you are trying to connect to must be running Windows for Workgroups
3.11 and must have the IPX/SPX Compatible Transport (either with or without
NetBIOS) installed as a protocol.
