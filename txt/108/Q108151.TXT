The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Windows for Workgroups stops responding (hangs) at the logo screen
during startup on an IBM ValuePoint personal computer.


CAUSE
=====

The Windows keyboard driver (VKD) times out on IBM ValuePoint computers with a
BIOS date of 4/29/93 or earlier, or with an EPROM Flash Revision Level of 5.1 to
5.3. This behavior also occurs on IBM ValuePoint SI computers that are Type
6381.

To determine the EPROM Flash Revision level, press the F1 key when a box appears
in the upper-left portion of the screen as the computer is booting. This takes
you into the Configuration Utilities Screen. The EPROM Revision Level is listed
at the bottom of this screen.

To determine if you have a Type 6381 ValuePoint, look at a label on the back of
the computer.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

 - Contact IBM Technical Support at (800) 772-2227 to receive a patch to the
   VKD.

   -or-

 - Contact the IBM bulletin board service at (919) 517-0001 and download the
   necessary files for your computer:

   IBMKBFIX.EXE (the VKD replacement for the ValuePoint PC)
   VP2FLxxx.DSK (Flash ROM, where xxx is the latest version number)

   6381WG31.ZIP (the VKD replacement for the ValuePoint SI PC)
   VPSIFL31.DSK (Flash ROM for the ValuePoint SI PCs)

   LDF.COM (used to uncompress the above files)
