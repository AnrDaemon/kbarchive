SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to compile a program that contains a FORMAT statement with the
illegal edit list may fail with the following warning

   warning F4989: 'X' : unexpected character in format

displayed should be a character from the edit list.

======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation
32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 and for MS-DOS, versions 1.0 and 1.0a. This
problem was fixed in FORTRAN PowerStation 32 version 4.0.
