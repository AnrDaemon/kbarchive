TITLE   :Art Gallery: Quick Keys & Mouse Invoke "Go Back" Differently
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Art Gallery for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Art Gallery can behave differently if you use the mouse versus if you use the
keyboard when you choose the "Go Back" option to return to a screen you were
looking at before. A popup that was open in the previous window will be closed
if you Go Back using the mouse, but it will still be open if you Go Back using
the keyboard.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Art Gallery version 1.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. In a window with an open popup, click the Next Page button.

2. Click the Go Back button.

   The popup is gone.

3. Click on the hot spot again to bring back the popup.

4. Press COMMAND+N to move to the next page.

5. Press COMMAND+B to return to the previous page.

   The popup is still there, redrawn in the center of the screen.

This behavior is not completely consistent.
