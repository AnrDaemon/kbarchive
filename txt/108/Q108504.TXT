TITLE   :SFM: Some Files Get Wrong Icon in Finder
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1 3.5 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Services for Macintosh (SFM) on a Windows NT Advanced Server,
some of the files may appear with incorrect icons to the Macintosh users.

WORKAROUND
==========

Load the file into Word for the Macintosh by running Word and then using the
choose Open from the File menu. After the file is loaded, choose Save As from
the File menu and use the same filename. This overwrites the original file and
will be fine.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you are using a Windows NT Advanced Server as a way to share files between
PC users and Macintosh users, some files may appear incorrectly, specifically
between Microsoft Word for Windows 6.0 and Microsoft Word for the Macintosh 5.1.
Out of 100 files saved by Word for Windows users, approximately five will show
up in the Macintosh Finder with a generic "PC file" icon. When the file is in
this state, Macintosh users cannot double- click the icon to edit the file.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT Advanced
Server version 3.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
