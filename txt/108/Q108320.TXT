SUMMARY
=======

The format of the Open(Station) request in the SNA Server 2.0 SNA Device
Interface Specification (SNADIS) is documented incorrectly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On page 66 of the "SNA Device Interface Specification" (SNADIS), the last field
provided in the Open(Station) request is incorrect.

The following entry

   dataru[s+44..s+45]  Maximum BTU size to be used with this station

should be replaced by two fields: a link data field followed by a Maximum BTU
size field. That is, the last line should become two lines as follows:

   dataru[s+44..s+89]     Copy of Link Data from Open(Link) request
   dataru[s+90..s+91]     Maximum BTU size to be used with this station

Additional query words: prodsna SNADIS BTU
