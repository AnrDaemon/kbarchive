SUMMARY
=======

ODIHLP.EXE cannot be loaded and unloaded from the MS-DOS command line. This
ability to dynamically load and unload is available in the Novell ODI
workstation files. Any ODI drivers loaded prior to ODIHLP.EXE (LSL.COM and the
network card driver as a minimum) are not unloadable.

To recover the memory used by these drivers, try using multiple configurations
MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2 so that you can access boot configurations with and without
the ODI drivers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows for Workgroups 3.11 includes support for Novell NetWare connectivity by
using a NetWare ODI workstation configuration and the ODIHLP.EXE support file.

ODIHLP.EXE is a real-mode component that allows the protect-mode NDIS 3 protocols
used by Windows for Workgroups 3.11 (NetBEUI and the IPX/SPX compatible
transports) to work with the real-mode ODI network card drivers and LSL.COM.

One benefit of ODI drivers (including MLID, LSL, IPXODI and NETX) is that they
can be unloaded from memory at the command line (for example, IPXODI /U).

ODIHLP.EXE, however, cannot be unloaded. If you want to unload the protocol
driver(s) and NETX, ODIHLP.EXE must load before them. ODIHLP.EXE binds to the
LSL and MLID and therefore does not allow these drivers to unload.
