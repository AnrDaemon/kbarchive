======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator for the Macintosh, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Flight Simulator version 4.0, View 1 may appear as one or more solid colors
or may contain an image that looks like a runway if the Spot Plane view is
selected.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the position of the spot plane coincides with the position of the actual
aircraft or the positions are very close together, the spot plane view will be
blocked by the other aircraft. To correct the problem, use the following steps:

1. From the Views menu, click Set Spot Plane.

2. Increase either the Distance or Altitude or both. This will move the spot
   plane away from the actual aircraft.

3. Click OK.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM
------------------------------

1. From the Views menu, click Set Spot Plane.

2. Set both the Distance and Altitude to 0 (zero).

3. Click OK.

4. Press COMMAND+H.

5. Click Spot.
