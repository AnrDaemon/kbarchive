The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your path is longer than 127 characters, the Stacker conversion program
cannot run. The error message you receive depends on the location of your
Stacker files.

If your Stacker files are in the C:\STACKER directory and your path is too long,
you receive the following error message:

   The MS-DOS Stacker conversion program cannot continue because it could not
   find your copy of the DBLSPACE.EXE file. The DBLSPACE.EXE should be located
   in the directory that contains your MS-DOS files.

   Add your MS-DOS directory to your search path, and then run CONVERT again.
   (For information about changing your search path, type "HELP PATH" (without
   the quotation marks) at the command prompt.)

If the Stacker files are not located in a C:\STACKER directory and your path is
too long, you receive the following error message:

   The MS-DOS Stacker conversion program cannot continue because it cannot find
   the Stacker CHECK.EXE or SCHECK.EXE programs.

   Add the directory that contains your Stacker files to your search path, and
   then run CONVERT again. Either the CHECK.EXE or the SCHECK.EXE file must be
   in your Stacker directory when you run CONVERT. (For information about
   changing your search path, type "HELP PATH" (without the quotation marks) at
   the command prompt.)

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, set the path to your Stacker and MS-DOS directories
and then run the Stacker conversion. For example, type "set
path=c:\dos;c:\stacker" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command
prompt and then press ENTER.
