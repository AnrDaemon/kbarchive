SUMMARY
=======

The documentation in the "Command-Line Utilities User's Guide" (hard copy and
online) may be misleading with regard to the function of the LIBRARY statement
in a module definition file (.DEF file). The documentation indicates that the
name specified after the LIBRARY statement in a .DEF file will be used as the
base name of the file that is written to disk as a result of the build process.
This is not true.

The Visual C++ 2.0 documentation has the correct information for the LIBRARY
statement.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The LIBRARY Statement only affects the module name of the dynamic-link library
(DLL) being built. The Windows concept of a "module" applies to either an
application (executable program) or a library. Both serve very different
purposes, yet applications and libraries are both types of modules.

The effect of the LIBRARY statement on a build is most easily shown by examining
the header information of the module created by running EXEHDR.EXE, giving the
module name as the input file. Pay particular attention to the "Library:" and
"Description:" fields, in the case of a DLL, and the "Module:" and
"Description:" fields, in the case of an executable.

To see where the module name is actually used, run a utility such as
HEAPWALKER.EXE. The information in the "Owner:" field is the module name of the
module associated with each entry.
