TITLE   :MS TCP/IP Does Not Load with ODINSUP on Token Ring
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========


On a LAN Manager 2.2 enhanced MS-DOS workstation under Windows for Workgroups 3.1
or 3.11, trying to load Microsoft TCP/IP on top of a Novell Netware ODI MLID and
ODINSUP fails with this error:

   Unloadable TCP 1.0 not loaded

Microsoft NetBEUI loads and functions in this configuration.

CAUSE
=====

TCP/IP issues an OpenAdapter NDIS call to determine if a token ring network card
is available and functional. If this call fails, TCP/IP fails to load.

Novell's ODINSUP NDIS support layer for ODI drivers does not provide support for
the OpenAdapter call. Instead it performs its own adapter initialization and
sets bit 4 of the MAC status table's flag field to indicate that the adapter is
already open.

RESOLUTION
==========

The TCPTSR driver was changed so that it does not attempt an OpenAdapter NDIS
call until it checks bit 4 of the MAC Service Specific Status Table to see if
the adapter is already open. This fix is available as CSD00.071.
