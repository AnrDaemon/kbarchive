TITLE   :PC Win: StripGatewayHeaders Limited to 75 Recipients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows includes in the [Microsoft Mail]
section of MSMAIL.INI the StripGatewayHeaders switch to remove extra headers
from foreign systems being displayed in the body of the message. This switch
does not work for messages with 76 recipients or more.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If this entry is 1 (the default), message header text (coming above the dashed
line) is stripped from Mail messages that arrive through a gateway.

If this entry is 0, you see the extended information supplied by the gateways,
which typically includes information such as message identifiers specific to the
foreign mail system.

If this entry is 2, all gateway headers except those from the X.400 Gateway are
stripped. Message header text supplied by native Mail for PC Networks clients is
always stripped.

Only the Mail for PC Networks transport supports this entry.
