TITLE   :PC MMTA: External Instances Using Dynamic Drives Can't Overlap
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Multitasking Message Transfer Agent, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When multiple instances of the External Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE) are run on a
single OS/2 workstation, the ranges of drive letters used for dynamic drives on
each instance of External must not overlap within the EXTERNAL.INI configuration
file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Dynamic drive names are specified with -F on the External or Dispatch command
line, or by the DrivesDynamic entry in the EXTERNAL.INI file. This option is
required only if dynamic drives are used (specified with DynAdmin or DrivesUNC
or DrivesNovell).

Examples
--------

The following instances are compatible:

   external -fmn
   external -fop
   external -fqr
   external -fst

The following are not compatible:

   external -fmn
   external -fop
   external -fno

In the second example above, the last instance conflicts with the first two
instances and must be modified to reflect distinct and mutually exclusive drive
ranges in order for the participating postoffices to be initialized correctly by
the External Mail program.

For more information, see page 36 in the Microsoft Mail "Multitasking MTA
Administrator's Guide."
