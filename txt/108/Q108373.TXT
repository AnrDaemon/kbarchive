TITLE   :PC WSPlus: Running Schedule+ Demo from a Network Installation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In versions 1.0 and 1.0a of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, the Schedule+ Demo
requires that the working directory be the directory containing the
demonstration program files (PLAY.EXE, SCHDPLUS.EXE, DEMOFX.DEX, and
CBLIB3.DLL).

This can create problems when you run Schedule+ from the network (a network
installation). Typically, a network administrator would want to limit the
directories that contain executable files to Read Only status. However, with the
Schedule+ Demo configuration, this is not possible.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following steps outline a procedure to create an alternate directory for
just the Schedule+ Demo files:

1. Create the directory X:\SCHDDEMO on the file server, where X is the server
   from which the Schedule+ Demo files are to be run.

2. Copy the following files from the SCHDPLUS directory to the newly created
   shared directory:

   PLAY.EXE
   SCHDPLUS.LES
   DEMOFX.DEX
   CBLIB3.DLL

3. From the Windows File Manager File menu, choose Associate. In the Files With
   Extension box, type "les" (without the quotation marks). In the Associate
   With box type "PLAY.EXE" (without the quotation marks). Choose OK.

4. From the Windows Program Manager File menu, choose New, then select Program
   Item. Then type the following information:
   +----------------------------------------------+
   | In This Box       | Type                     | 
   +----------------------------------------------+
   | Description       | Schedule+ Demo           | 
   +----------------------------------------------+
   | Command Line      | x:\schddemo\schdplus.les | 
   +----------------------------------------------+
   | Working Directory | x:\schddemo              | 
   +----------------------------------------------+

You should now be able to run the Schedule+ Demo by double-clicking the Schedule+
Demo icon or by double-clicking the SCHDPLUS.LES file in File Manager.
