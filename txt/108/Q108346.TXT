TITLE   :FIX: Substring Out of Range Hangs with -4Yb -Ox -G5
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to execute a program that is compiled using the -4Yb, -Ox, and -G5
options and that contains a character substring expression out of range may
cause the application to hang.

CAUSE
=====

Compiler options -4Yb and -G5, along with the optimization (option -Ox) cause
the compiler to generate incorrect code.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem does not occur with a different combination of options. Avoid the
-Ox optimization option, the -4Yb extended-error-handling option, or use the -G4
processor option instead of -G5.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation 32 for
Windows NT, version 1.0. This problem was fixed in FORTRAN PowerStation, version
4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The example program below demonstrates the problem:

Sample Code
-----------

   C Compile options needed: -4Yb, -Ox and -G5

         character m*10 /'1234567890'/ 
         l = 3
         write(*,*) l ! putting this inside the loop avoids hang
         do while (m(l:l) .ne. 'Q')
         l = l + 1
         end do
         write(*,*) 'L = ', l
         write(*,*) 'M = ', m
         end
