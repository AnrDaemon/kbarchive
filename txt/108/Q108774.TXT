The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

Some of the extended character set fonts do not display or print all characters
in Microsoft Word version 6.0 for Windows. The extended character set font names
are preceded by a 2-letter code indicating a Bitstream character set. (For
example. "BN Swiss" refers to the Swiss font in the Business character set.) One
character known to disappear in Word is the apostrophe (').

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Bitstream TypeCity cartridge is a font cartridge for Hewlett-Packard (HP)
LaserJet printers that has slots for smaller font cartridges. Bitstream sells a
variety of these "mini" font cartridges and many of them can be plugged into the
TypeCity cartridge at one time.

The software for the TypeCity cartridge includes Bitstream Facelift. The "README"
file states that applications that do their own character mapping may be unable
to access all characters when Facelift is installed.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
or reliability.
