-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a card with a fir tree or pencil border on a Hewlett-Packard (HP)
DeskJet 550C, some of the border elements may print incorrectly. For example,
the green fir trees may print gray or striped instead of green. This problem is
most severe on the rotated (upside-down) pages.

This problem occurs if you are using a 256-color video driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, do one of the following:

 - Switch to the standard Windows VGA video driver and restart Windows, then try
   printing again.

 - Try printing to a different printer.

 - Try using a different border.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem has been found to occur with the fir tree and pencil borders, but
may also occur with other border patterns as well. This problem may occur on a
variety of printers, including Panasonic dot matrix and Hewlett Packard DeskJet
printers, even if they are set to print in all-color mode. The same borders
print correctly, however, if you use them on a page in the Writing Studio.
