TITLE   :Writer: Borders Print Incorrectly with ATI Mach32
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Kids Products
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,1.1,1.1a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a Writing Studio document with a border, you may find that boxes
print around each of the border pictures. This occurs if you are using version
2.1 of the ATI Mach32 256-color video driver.

When you print a colored border, it may print with a blue box around each border
element. When you print a black and white border, it may print with a muddy
green background behind each border element.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Creative Writer version 1.0 and
1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem does not occur with 256-color video drivers other than the ATI
Mach32 video driver. If your card supports another 256-color video driver, try
using it instead. If not, you can eliminate the problem by switching to the
standard Windows VGA video driver. After changing your video driver, restart
Windows and try printing the document again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem has not been found to occur in Windows 95, which ships with updated
ATI drivers.
