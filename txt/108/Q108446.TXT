-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
 - Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use adult mode (the Control Room) to save a document you created in the
Project Workshop, it won't appear to get saved when you try to save it again in
normal mode. In reality it is saved, but it is saved under a default name. You
are not given the option to give the document a unique name.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Creative Writer version 1.0, 1.1
and 1.1a. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available. These symptoms are not
displayed Fine Artist.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. In the Project Workshop, choose to make a banner, a card, or a newspaper. The
   wizard starts.

2. Follow a few of the instructions to add text or borders, then press
   CTRL+SHIFT+A to go to adult mode (the Control Room).

3. From the File menu, choose Save As. Name the document.

4. From the File menu, choose Return to Creative Writer. This returns you to the
   document.

5. Continue to follow the wizard's instructions until Max asks you if you want
   to save your work. Choose yes.

Creative Writer does not ask you to name your document, and the name displayed at
the bottom of the screen does not change. If it's a banner, for example, it will
still display "Banner in Progress" instead of a specific banner name. "Banner in
Progress" has become the name of this specific document.
