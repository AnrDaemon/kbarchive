-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Art Gallery for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Wine Guide for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print images from Art Gallery or Wine Guide, the right side of the
printed graphic may be cut off. This occurs because the page prints at the same
proportions whether the image is in portrait or landscape orientation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, you must manually scale the page. To scale the page,
follow these steps:

1. From the File menu, choose Page Setup.

2. In the Reduce or Enlarge field, enter an enlargement or reduction percentage.

3. Choose OK.

4. Print the page.

Using trial and error, you should be able to find a percentage at which the
entire graphic prints on the page without being cut off.
