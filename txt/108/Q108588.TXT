The information in this article applies to:

 - The App Studio, used with:
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows* use 1699

SYMPTOMS
========

If ID_APP_EXIT is used as the resource identifier for a button control in a
dialog box, it will exit App Studio when the dialog box is tested. In App Studio
for Windows NT, if the dialog box is tested, it will exit and cause an
application exception in App Studio.

Some other resource identifiers that may cause side effects while being tested
inside App Studio are:

   ID_WINDOW_NEW
   ID_WINDOW_CASCADE
   ID_WINDOW_TILE_HORZ
   ID_WINDOW_TILE_VERT
   ID_HELP_INDEX

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 2.0, which includes MFC version
3.0. However, the problem still exists in the 16-bit product line.

MORE INFORMATION

1. Open App Studio.

2. Open an existing .RC file (use any of Scribble's resource scripts).

3. Open the About dialog box.

4. Add a button.

5. Change the button's ID to ID_APP_EXIT.

6. Test the dialog box and choose the new button.
