SUMMARY
=======

For each TrueType font, there are associated files (weights) for the different
formatting options (bold, italic, and bold/italic). These are listed in the
Fonts dialog box of Control Panel and in the WIN.INI file. For example, the
options for Arial appear as follows:

[Fonts]
Arial (TrueType)=ARIAL.FOT
Arial Bold (TrueType)=ARIALBD.FOT
Arial Bold Italic (TrueType)=ARIALBI.FOT
Arial Italic (TrueType)=ARIALI.FOT

If you remove the Arial bold weight, the bold option is still available in
applications because the Arial font can still generate the various weights, even
though the file associated with the bold option no longer exists.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To maintain the high quality type produced by TrueType fonts, you should keep
the different weights (and their associated files) available on your system. If
you do not, the type is not the usual high quality associated with TrueType
fonts.

Microsoft recommends that these various weights remain available to Windows-
based applications to maintain the high quality of TrueType fonts. However, if
the quality of the font is not a concern, then disk space used and the number of
WIN.INI font entries can be reduced by removing these files. For example, with
Arial you can remove Arial Bold, Arial Bold Italic, and Arial Italic from the
Fonts dialog box in Control Panel.
