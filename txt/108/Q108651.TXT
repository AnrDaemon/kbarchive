KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator for MS-DOS, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start Flight Simulator 5.0, you may receive the following
error message:

   Disk error has occurred!
   Filename: FS5.INI
   ERROR CODE: 0002


This error message indicates that the FS5.ini is missing or damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

Reinstalling Flight Simulator may not be necessary. Change to the Flight
Simulator 5.0 directory (FLTSIM5 by default) and run Setup.exe. The Setup
program may rebuild the FS5.ini.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In some cases, Setup.exe may be damaged and you may be unable to run the Setup
program. Copy a new copy of Setup.exe from disk 1.

Flight Simulator 5.0 runs on a minimal FS5.ini consisting of 14 lines.

   G2D=VGB.GRA
   G3D=FSOG3D.FSO
   KBD=KBD2.FSO
   MOUSE=ON
   SETUP=OFF
   SITUATION=SITUATION\FS5.STN
   STARTUP_DEMO=VIDEOS\FS5.VID
   INCLUDE=FSO001.FSO
   INCLUDE=UTIL.FSO
   INCLUDE=APL001.FSO
   INCLUDE=WEATHER.FSO
   INCLUDE=BGLFE.FSO
   INCLUDE=LESSONS.FSO
   INCLUDE=U2D.FSO

NOTE: There is an "O" (as in Oscar) in the line INCLUDE=FSO001.FSO (that is,
F,S,O,zero,zero,1.F,S,O).

With these entries, the Cessna will be on the runway at Meigs field.

If you receive the following error message:

   FATAL error has occurred!
   Filename: FORN-000.FRN
   ERROR CODE: 8027

one or more of the above lines is missing from the FS5.ini file. With the above
lines in the FS5.ini, the Setup program will fill in the missing lines and
produce a new and complete FS5.ini with full functionality.

NOTE: The above FORN-000.FRN error occurs if you have an overdrive chip installed
on your system. There is no known resolution.

For more information about the FORN-0000.FRN error message, please see the
