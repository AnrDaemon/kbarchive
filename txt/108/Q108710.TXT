SYMPTOMS
========

You can use the Visual Basic Control Development Kit (CDK) to design a graphical
custom control to perform visual effects. However, when another control such as
a Visual Basic button becomes visible on the same form as your custom control,
the graphical control repaints even though its client area has not been
invalidated.

CAUSE
=====

The repaint logic in Visual Basic causes this behavior. Graphical controls get a
VBM_PAINT message every time their container gets a WM_PAINT message, regardless
of whether the graphical control is in the invalidated area.

The VBM_PAINT message is the paint notification for graphical controls. The value
of the VBM_PAINT constant is defined in the VBAPI.H file in Visual Basic's CDK
directory. WM_PAINT is a message for windowed controls. For examples of
VBM_PAINT and WM_PAINT, see the PIX.C file in Visual Basic's CDK directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can work around this behavior in the VBM_PAINT handler with the following C
code:

      if (!RectVisible((HDC)wParam,(LPRECT)lParam)) {
         // Control is not in the paint region
         // Don't bother to repaint
         break;
         }
