SYMPTOMS
========

If print jobs were not completely printing from MS-DOS-based applications as
described in article Q113130 in the Microsoft Knowledge Base, and you installed
a new WINPRINT.DLL and set the data type to TEXT, you may still experience
problems. When you print from a graphics-based application on an MS-DOS client,
many irrelevant extra pages print.

======

Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem has been corrected in Windows NT
Workstation and Windows NT Server version 3.5. This problem has also been
corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced
