SUMMARY
=======

When you use Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with 32-bit file access, the
maximum amount of memory that can be set in the 386 Enhanced dialog box in
Control Panel is 24 megabytes (MB)(or 24,576 kilobytes [K]).

Microsoft Windows 95 does not provide a user interface to change the 32-bit file
access cache size.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although the user interface is limited to 24 MB, the theoretical maximum size of
the cache is actually 2GB. This cache size is using physical RAM; therefore, the
cache size is limited to the amount of RAM on your computer. Setting the cache
size greater than the physical amount of RAM available results in the following
error message when re-entering the Virtual Memory settings in the 386 Enhanced
dialog box:

   32-bit file access was unable to run. Your hard disk(s) may not be compatible
   with 32-bit file access.

Steps to Manually Increase or Decrease the Cache Size
for Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and Windows 95
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Open the System.ini file in a text editor, such as Microsoft Windows Notepad.

2. Go to the [VCache] section.

3. Change the MinFileCache= and the MaxFileCache= settings to the desired
   value.

   NOTE: The value for these settings are in kilobytes. For example, if you want
   to create a 50-MB cache that cannot exceed 55 MB, the lines would be as
   follows:

         [VCache]
         MinFileCache=51200
         MaxFileCache=56320

Please note that Microsoft's testing did not include cache sizes greater than
40MB. Microsoft makes no guarantees that the cache size will operate correctly
when increased above the user interface. Microsoft is not responsible for data
loss or data corruption due to a cache size larger than the user interface.
