TITLE   :BUG: "Invalid File Descriptor" When Saving Read-Only Query
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5,2.5a,2.5b,2.6,3.0,5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp250bug kbvfp250aBUG

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 5.0a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Saving a query that was given the Read-Only attribute with the MS-DOS ATTRIB
command causes the errors "File Access Denied" and "Invalid File Descriptor." In
versions before 5.0a, the machine is then in an unrecoverable loop.

RESOLUTION
==========

Save the modified query to something other than the original name, or to another
read-only .QPR file on the hard disk. You will then have two copies of the
query, but will not receive the above errors.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

WARNING: Close all running applications and save your data before following this
procedure. To close all open applications, press the CTRL+ESC keys to open the
Windows Task List, and then close all the other applications you have running.
Note that following the steps below may produce lost allocation units, lost
clusters, or cross-linked files.

1. Create a new query.

2. Save the query and close it.

3. At the MS-DOS prompt, type the following to make the query read-only: attrib
   query.qpr +r

4. Reopen the query and modify it.

Unless you are working in Visual FoxPro 5.0a for Windows, the machine will hang
in an endless loop. To break the loop, press CTRL+ALT+DEL twice or turn your
machine off and on.
