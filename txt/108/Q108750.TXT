TITLE   :You Must Use "DBLSPACE /FORMAT A:" to Format That Drive
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you unmount a compressed volume file (CVF) on a floppy disk drive and then
try to use the MS-DOS FORMAT command to format a floppy disk, you may receive
the following message

   You must use "DBLSPACE /FORMAT <X>:" to format that drive.

where <X> is the floppy disk drive letter.

CAUSE
=====

This message is caused by the new Automount feature in MS-DOS 6.2. Any command
that attempts to access a floppy disk drive containing a disk with a CVF mounts
that CVF.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Change to the drive letter that contains the compressed floppy disk (usually
   A: or B:) by typing "A:" (without the quotation marks) or "B:" (without the
   quotation marks).

2. Type "dblspace /unmount <x>:" (without the quotation marks) where
   <x> is the floppy disk drive letter.

3. Type "format <x>:" (without the quotation marks) where <x> is the
   floppy disk drive letter.

Additional query words: 6.20
