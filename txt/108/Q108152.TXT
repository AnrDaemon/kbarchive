======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

 - The utilities that STAC Electronics Stacker 3.1 installs in Windows for
   Workgroups 3.11 File Manager do not work when 32-bit file access is enabled.

   -or-

 - When you are using Stacker version 4.0, you cannot use 32-bit file access on
   any compressed drive.

NOTE: 32-bit disk access is still available on any compressed or uncompressed
drive.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem with Stacker 3.1, disable 32-bit file access while
you are using the utilities. To do this, choose the 386 Enhanced icon in Control
Panel, choose the Virtual Memory button, choose Change, and then clear the
32-Bit File Access check box. You can restore 32-bit file access when you are
finished using the utilities without causing any damage to the disk.

If you are using Stacker version 4.0, you can work around this problem by
obtaining a file that enables the use of 32-bit file access on Stacker-
compressed drives. This self-extracting file (S32BFA.EXE) is available on the
STAC Electronics bulletin board service (BBS). Although this file has been
tested by STAC Electronics, as of 8/29/94, the beta test is not yet complete.
S32BFA.EXE can be downloaded from LIB:1 in the STAC forum on the STAC
Electronics BBS. For more information, contact STAC Electronics.

STAC Electronics also suggests that you can work around this problem by loading
SMARTDrive from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. You can use the 386 Enhanced icon in
Control Panel to set up a swap file and 32-bit file access for any uncompressed
drive. Stacker adds an icon called Virtual Memory to Control Panel. You can set
up a swap file on any drive and enable 32-bit disk access with this icon.

Stacker 3.1 adds the following menu to File Manager:

   Stacker
   -------

   File Info
   Disk Info

If you try to choose one of these menu items, the following error message is
displayed:

   Stacker not installed

The Stacker volume file still functions properly with 32-bit file access enabled,
and all files are available normally.
