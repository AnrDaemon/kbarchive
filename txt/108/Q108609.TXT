The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 5.0a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b

SYMPTOMS
========

The SET MESSAGE WINDOW [<window name>] command does not work as expected.

This command is supposed to let you specify where to display messages created
with the WAIT, @ ... PROMPT, DEFINE BAR, DEFINE MENU, DEFINE PAD, and DEFINE
POPUP commands. It cannot be used to control the placement of a WAIT WINDOW.

The following program demonstrates the intended usage of the SET MESSAGE WINDOW
command:

      DEFINE WINDOW X FROM 20,20 TO 23,65
      ACTIVATE WINDOW X
      SET MESSAGE WINDOW X
      WAIT 'Check out the location of this message!'
      RELEASE WINDOW x
      CLEAR
      SET MESSAGE WINDOW && Resets SET MESSAGE WINDOW to the default
      WAIT 'Now look where the message appears by default'

However, if you eliminate both SET MESSAGE WINDOW lines from this code sample,
the program performs no differently.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
