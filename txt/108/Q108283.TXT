TITLE   :FIX: F1001 in codegen.c with IMPLICIT COMPLEX
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Compiling a FORTRAN PowerStation routine that uses IMPLICIT COMPLEX may produce
the following error:

   fatal error F1001: INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR
   (compiler file '@(#)codegen.c:1.167', line 309)
   Contact Microsoft Product Support Services

RESOLUTION
==========

Explicitly declare all COMPLEX variables.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0
for MS-DOS. This problem has been resolved with FORTRAN PowerStation maintenance
release version 1.0a for MS-DOS.

FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0 can be differentiated from the maintenance
release version 1.0a by invoking the linker. Typing "link32 | more" (without the
quotation marks) from \F32\BIN directory will show version 2.8 for FORTRAN
PowerStation version 1.0, and it will show version 1.0f for the maintenance
release version 1.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To demonstrate the problem, compile the sample code below with the FORTRAN
PowerStation:

Sample Code
-----------

   c--- compile options needed: none
         implicit complex (a-p,r-z)
         end
