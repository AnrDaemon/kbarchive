SUMMARY
=======

The WordPerfect Library program, a separate shell program sold by WordPerfect,
is a resident program that supplies a number of resident utilities, such as a
calendar and notepad. Running this program through your AUTOEXEC.BAT file causes
Windows to stop responding (hang) while loading.

To run Windows successfully, remove the Library program from the AUTOEXEC.BAT
file and reboot. The functions provided by this program are available through
Windows, so you do not lose any capabilities.
