SUMMARY
=======

To run Microsoft Mail under Windows/286, do the following:

   your network card.

2. Start the Notifier and sign in to Microsoft Mail.

3. Start Windows.

4. In the MS-DOS Executive window, choose MAIL286.PIF. This file is
   automatically copied to your Mail directory by the Setup program.

5. When you've finished with your mailbox, choose Exit from the File menu to
   return to the MS-DOS Executive window but remain signed on to the Mail
   system.

MORE INFORMATION
================

As you work with applications in Windows, you can check your mailbox by
switching from the application's window to the MS-DOS Executive window and
running MAIL286.PIF.

While working with an application in Windows/286, the Notifier alert window won't
appear when you receive a new message if the application is displaying in
graphics mode. However, you will hear a chime if you've chosen that option from
the Preferences dialog box (on the Mail menu).

For more information about running Mail with Windows/286, see Appendix C, "Using
Mail with Microsoft Windows," in the "Microsoft Mail User's Guide."
