-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you are using the TOPS FlashCard for the PC, you will be unable to run
Microsoft Mail (PC Client) under Windows/386 because the TOPS/DOS software
modules provided with the FlashCard do not work under the Windows/386
environment. Both TOPS/DOS version 2.0 (ATALK.SYS device driver) and TOPS/DOS
versions 2.1 and 3.0 (ALAP.EXE AppleTalk driver) do not run correctly with
Windows/386.

For more information about Mail (PC Client) and Windows/386, see Appendix C,
"Using Mail with Microsoft Windows," in the "Microsoft Mail User's Guide."
