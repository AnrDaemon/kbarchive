TITLE   :Expressions in Definitions Changed for MASM 5.10
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::5.1

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 5.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In all versions of Microsoft Macro Assembler earlier than version 5.1, you could
not have an expression with a larger than 16-bits in a definition. This has been
changed in version 5.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In all versions of MASM before version 5.1, you could use constants of greater
than 16 bits; however, you could not use an arithmetic expression to obtain a
number larger than 16 bits.

The following is an example:

      DD 86400     <-  correct.
      DD 60*60*24  <-  incorrect. This would be truncated at the
                                  16-bit value.

This feature has been implemented in version 5.1 so that both of the above
declarations will yield the same answer.
