SUMMARY
=======

The south-end altitude of Boeing Field is 400 feet and the north-end altitude is
17 feet above sea level. As you taxi from the south end to the north end of the
runway, the elevation decreases approximately 383 feet. Because of this change,
you will experience a crash in Versions 2.13 and 2.14. In Versions 3.00 and
Version 4.00, the plane does not crash, but the altitude changes drastically on
the altimeter.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
