The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 2.03, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using the Softerm terminal emulation program and have a host
connection that is on COM1 and a serial mouse on COM2, Softerm disables the
serial mouse under Microsoft Windows.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Softerm initializes both COM ports and Windows has
no way of reinitializing them.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. From the command line, start Softerm with a parameter of "/c" (without the
   quotation marks). This returns a screen with I/O addresses/status.

2. Fill the COM2 location (02F8) with zeros (zero it out).

You then can run the serial mouse under Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
