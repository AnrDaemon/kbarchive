-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS, versions 3.x, 4.x, 5.x 
 - Microsoft LINK for OS/2, version 5.x 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to link an application fails and Microsoft LINK generates the
following message:

   L1102: unexpected end-of-file

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when the linker attempts to use a corrupted or null library to
resolve external symbols. The library was probably corrupted at the library
creation stage in Setup.

The L1102 error can also occur if you type the name of a library used to build
the application at the "list file" prompt, as follows:

   Run File  [SPUD.EXE]: main.exe
   List File [NUL.MAP]: libname.lib (generates faulty library)
   Libraries [.LIB]: libname.lib
   Definition File [NUL.DEF]: main.def

This process creates a map listing with the specified library name in the current
working directory. Because LINK searches the current working directory before
the directories specified in the LIB environment variable, the L1102 error
occurs when LINK searches the listing file instead of the library.

RESOLUTION
==========

Check the LIB directory for small or zero-sized libraries. Use Setup to rebuild
libraries as necessary.
