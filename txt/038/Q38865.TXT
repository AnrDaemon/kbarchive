SUMMARY
=======

To use the /2 switch to enable dual-monitor debugging in CodeView, your computer
must be equipped with a monochrome display (MDA) and a color display
(CGA/EGA/VGA). Monochrome display adapters are not generally available for the
IBM PS/2 computers because they come with built-in VGAs or MDAs, but not both.
This means that dual-monitor debugging is usually not possible on a PS/2
system.

This is a hardware issue and not a CodeView limitation; therefore, when hardware
vendors start selling MDAs that can be added to PS/2 systems with built-in VGAs,
then CodeView dual-monitor debugging will be available on the PS/2.
