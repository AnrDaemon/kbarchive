The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to delete a compressed DriveSpace or DoubleSpace floppy disk using
MS-DOS 6.22 and the command DRVSPACE /DELETE A: or DBLSPACE /DELETE A:, the
following message is displayed:

   Deleting drive A will permanently erase it and all the files it contains. Are
   you sure you want to delete drive A?

When you press ENTER proceed with the deletion, an "X" is displayed and you are
returned to the command prompt. The deletion is not processed.

CAUSE
=====

The default for the DRVSPACE /DELETE and DBLSPACE /DELETE commands is "No," so
when you press ENTER, no change occurs. The DRVSPACE /DELETE or DBLSPACE /DELETE
command does not prompt you with the expected [Y/N] response.

RESOLUTION
==========

Type Y (yes) to delete the compressed drive.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS version 6.22. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
