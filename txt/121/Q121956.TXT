TITLE   :PC Adm: Mail 3.2a Update Leaves Zero-Byte .GLB  Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you update a postoffice from Microsoft Mail version 3.2 to version 3.2a and
you select the Modify Postoffice option, the Server Setup program creates two
temporary .GLB files and does not delete them when it is finished. These files
are:

   DELTID.GLB
   NPTRANS.GLB

The version 3.2a Server Setup program asks "Do you wish to modify the postoffice
database?" Regardless of whether you choose "Yes" or "No," these files will
appear. These files will be generated as a result of either installing or
removing enhanced security or modifying the network type (either LAN Man
compatible or Novell).

If you select Modify Postoffice Database and select Install/Remove Enhanced
Security, the ACCESS.GLB file is modified. The other Access files, ACCESS2.GLB
and ACCESS3.GLB, are not modified. This will cause the date and timestamps for
these files to be different.

When Setup is running, during the Updating Postoffice section the messages
"Generating NPTRANS.GLB" and "Generating DELTID.GLB" will display on the screen.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2a of Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The existence of these two files will not affect the functionality of Mail in
any way.
