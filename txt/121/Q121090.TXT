-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you start Windows for Workgroups with the command WIN /D:T and you try to
print or use a communications (COM) port, you receive the following error
message:

   LPT1 is being used by another application.
   When the application is finished with the port, resume printing.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You may need to start Windows for Workgroups with the /D:T switch as part of
standard troubleshooting. Doing so disables all printing and communications
until Windows for Workgroups is restarted normally.

Under normal circumstances, the communications driver (COMM.DRV) calls VCOMM.386
to determine the appropriate port and parameters to print or communicate to. The
/D:T switch prevents all *.386 files from loading. Therefore, when COMM.DRV
attempts to call VCOMM.386 to begin printing, the driver is not loaded into
memory, further printing and communications port use is impossible, and the
error message is displayed.

This behavior is by design; the /D:T switch is included for troubleshooting
purposes only.
