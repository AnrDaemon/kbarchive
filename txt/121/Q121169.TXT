======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Lotus ScreenCam for Windows version 1.0a, the screen goes
completely blank--you see nothing other than the mouse moving.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when ScreenCam tries to access Windows 95 internal system
data using incorrect commands. This prevents ScreenCam from repainting the
display, resulting in the blank screen.

WORKAROUND
==========

ScreenCam does run correctly when loaded from Microsoft Windows version 3.x in a
virtual machine (VM). For more information about running Microsoft Windows
version 3.x in a VM, refer to the Windows 95 release notes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

cursor movements, and sound into an integrated movie.

of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
