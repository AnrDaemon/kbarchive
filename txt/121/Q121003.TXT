SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft NT Server version 3.5 allows multiple network cards to bind to the
NetBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP). However, the WINS service can only bind to one
network card. By default, the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) service will
bind to the first adapter bound with NetBT. As a result, when you configure WINS
client addresses, be sure to specify the IP address of the adapter and not
another IP address such as that of an adapter that might be on the same subnet
as the client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft does not recommend that the WINS service run on a computer with two or
more network cards (multihomed) on disjoint networks. MS-DOS clients that query
WINS may not be able to reach computers with multiple network cards that
straddle disjoint networks due to the fact that MS-DOS clients always pick the
first IP address supplied by the WINS server. The MS-DOS client may fail to
connect to that computer because it may be using one of the "unreachable"
addresses supplied by the WINS server. However, you can configure a multihomed
computer to register with different WINS servers for each adapter card. If the
multihomed computer straddles two disjoint networks, the computers on either
side would use the WINS server on their network to resolve names. Then the WINS
server would return only the IP address registered on the requesting clients'
network.
