SUMMARY
=======

Some scenery objects in Space Simulator are identical in shape and surface
texture.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Stars in Space Simulator are all identical in shape and texture, but vary in
size and color. Comets, asteroids, and some moons in Space Simulator are
identical in shape, texture, and color and differ only in size. This is done to
maximize Space Simulator's performance and reduce necessary disk space.
