SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start the AMI Pro QuickStart Tutorial in Windows 95, you receive
the following message:

   QuickStart Tutorial will not run unless the AMI Pro window is maximized and
   the Border Width is set to 3 in Control Panel.

CAUSE
=====

In Windows 95, this error occurs when the Active Window Border is set to 3
because the border proportions are different than in Windows 3.x. The border
width in Windows 95 is wider than that of Windows 3.x. For example, a setting of
1 inch in the Windows 95 Control Panel is equivalent to a setting of 3 in the
Windows 3.x Control Panel.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, change the Active Window Border to 1. To do this:

1. Use the right (secondary) mouse button to click the desktop.

2. Click Properties.

3. Click the Appearance tab.

4. In the Item box, click Active Windows Border.

5. Change the setting in the Size box to 1.

6. Click Apply Now to accept the new setting, then click OK.

The tutorial should now run correctly.
