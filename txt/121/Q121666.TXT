TITLE   :CONN: Err Msg: Error [20] Insufficient Memory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For Appletalk Networks
PROD/VER::1.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Connection Gateway, version 1.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using version 1.0b of the Mail Connection Gateway and if a Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks mail message sent to a user on the Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk
Networks becomes corrupt, the PC side of the Mail Connection Gateway will return
an error message:

   Error [20] Insufficient Memory Returned from FFAPI Program

The PC MACGATE.EXE program will exit to MS-DOS and display the above error
message. As a result, Mail will not be transferred between the Macintosh and the
PC Mail systems.

CAUSE
=====

There are two possible causes for this error.

One possible cause is a corrupt PC mail message waiting to be delivered to the
Macintosh. This keeps any of the messages that come later from being delivered
through the Gateway.

Another possibility is that a lot of names are on the TO: field. This may cause
MACGATE.EXE to run out of memory. This happens because Connection 1.0b uses an
older version of FFAPI and was compiled using a small memory model. Version 3.2
of Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks uses the large memory
model and is less likely to encounter out-of- memory problems than version 1.0b.

RESOLUTION
==========

Delete or return the oldest message in the MSMail queue on the Mail Connection
Gateway postoffice. This message may not necessarily be at the bottom of the
queue.

NOTE: There may be multiple messages in the queue with the same time stamp.

You may have to delete or return all mail with this time stamp in order to remove
the corrupt message.

If the problem is frequent, then the cause for the corruption should be checked.
It is likely a network issue and may require a network trace or sniffer reading
to see why the messages are corrupt.
