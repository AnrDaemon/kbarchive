The MIDISX application allows the user to edit a system exclusive message and
transmit it to another MIDI device. The application can receive, display, and
save to disk up to 64K of returned system exclusive data. MIDI input and output
devices are selected from the application menu, and the application implements
techniques that allow it to share MIDI devices with other applications. Wrapper
functions encapsulate low-level MIDI APIs, handle errors, and simplify
application code.
