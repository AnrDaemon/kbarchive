PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

In order to install Windows NT 3.5 on a Compaq Deskpro XL566 computer with a
built-in PCI SCSI-II controller, a built-in Netflex network adapter, and a
QVision 2000 video adapter, drivers for these devices are required. These
drivers are available on the Windows NT 3.5 Installation compact disc at the
following locations:

   DRVLIB\STORAGE\AMD\X86   (for PCI SCSI-II controller)
   DRVLIB\NETCARD\X86\PCNET (for the Netflex network adapter)
   DRVLIB\VIDEO\CPQ2000\X86 (for the QVision 2000 video adapter)

They must be copied from these libraries onto separate floppies, and then used
during Windows NT Setup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you do not have a CD-ROM drive or the Windows NT 3.5 Installation compact
disc, you can obtain the drivers from Compaq. Compaq has just released the
official support disk for Windows NT 3.5 for Compaq products called the Compaq
Support Software Diskette (SSD) for Windows NT 3.5 version 1.12a. This will also
be available on the Compaq forum on CompuServe as Softpaq #925. Refer to the
README file for a list of drivers.

The Compaq products discussed here are manufactured by Compaq Computer Corp., a
vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding the products' performance or reliability.
