KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to modify or build a project, one of the following error
messages appear:

 - FoxPro 2.x:

   Memo file missing/invalid

-or-

 - Visual FoxPro:

   Memo file <file_name> is missing or is invalid

After this error occurs, the project cannot be built or compiled.

CAUSE
=====

This error is usually caused by one of the following two problems:

 - The project's memo file (.PJT) is damaged, missing, or corrupt.

   -or-

 - A file referenced in the project contains a faulty memo file. FoxPro report,
   menu, and screen files all contain corresponding memo files. These files have
   extensions of .FRT, .MNT, and .SCT, respectively.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A FoxPro project contains two separate files: a .PJX file (database) and a .PJT
file (memo). Both of these files store crucial information about the project.

To Troubleshoot This Problem
----------------------------

1. Check that both the .PJX and .PJT files exist in the same directory. After
   moving a project to a new location, the memo file is sometimes left in the
   previous directory.

2. Create a new project and add the main program to it. Build the new project
   into an application. If the project memo file (.PJT) is damaged or corrupt,
   this technique corrects the problem.

3. Open each file referenced in the project to determine if that file has a
   damaged or corrupt memo file. For example, to open a screen file as a
   database, type "USE <screen-name>.scx" (without the quotation marks) in
   the Command window. If FoxPro detects a bad memo file, an error message will
   appear.
