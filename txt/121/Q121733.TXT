TITLE   :PC Ext: Err: [012] This Corrupt Message Cannot Be Delivered...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The External Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE) may generate the following entry in the
SYSTEM.LOG files of a destination postoffice:

   [012] This corrupt message cannot be delivered. Contact your administrator.

The originator of the message may receive a similar message that also includes
the returned mail item. The returned message shows no apparent corruption.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur when multiple recipients are specified for one postoffice
and one of the recipients experiences a delivery problem. As the External Mail
program tries to create the SYSTEM.LOG report, memory can be corrupted. This
memory corruption can cause the External Mail program to stop responding (hang),
or to produce a SYS3175 message in the OS/2 environment or a general protection
error in the NT environment.

When you restart the External Mail program, the [012] error message may be
generated during the External Mail program's "Delivering new mail" cycle. The
012 message is not generated consistently and seems to depend on the combination
of messages with which External is working.

This problem does not occur for mail sent from user to user within one
postoffice.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2.9 of the External
Mail program. This problem was corrected in version 3.2.12 of EXTERNAL.EXE. If
you do not have version 3.2.12 (or later), you can download EXTUPD.EXE, a
