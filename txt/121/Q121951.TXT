TITLE   :PC DOS Win: PAB Retains Old Address of a Moved User
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A user's Personal Address Book (PAB) does not get updated if one of the users in
the PAB moves to a different postoffice.

For example, suppose user A has user X in his or her PAB. User X then moves to a
different postoffice, directory synchronization (Dir-Sync) runs, and the Global
Address List (GAL) is rebuilt. User A still has user X's old address in his or
her PAB and needs to re-add user X from the GAL.

If user A creates a group (without re-adding X in his PAB) and adds user X from
the GAL to this group; the group still gets the old address from the PAB even
though user X's name was selected from the GAL.

It does not matter whether User X was moved by using the MOVEUSER utility or by
importing his or her Mail message file (MMF) in the new postoffice.

This applies problem occurs with both the MS-DOS and the Windows Mail clients.

======
