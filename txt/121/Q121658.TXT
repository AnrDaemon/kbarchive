TITLE   :SMS Remote Control Fails if Not Enough LANAs are Available
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbConfig smshowto smsconfig

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Help Desk and Diagnostics fail from the Systems Management Server Admin user
interface (UI) if the protocol binding needed is greater than the number of
default LANAs in the Windows NT Registry. For example, if the LANA number for
the binding is 5 and the Registry only shows default for 4 LANAs, the UI
attempts the command but fails.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

      \SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Components\SightNT\Lana

3. Add the Default entries for the needed LANAs. For example, from the Edit
   menu, choose Add Value. Enter values for the following:

         Value Name: Default# (where # is the next LANA number)
         Data Type: REG_DWORD
         Data: (Enter the LANA number you are adding, in Hex)

4. Choose OK and quit Registry Editor.

5. Quit Systems Management Server Admin and restart Systems Management Server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.0. This problem was corrected in Systems Management Server version
1.1.

In Systems Management Server version 1.1, seven lanas are scanned by default.
