TITLE   :ISDN Server Does Not Answer Incoming Calls
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT 3.5 Remote Access Services (RAS) doesn't answer incoming ISDN calls.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the phone number (in the Network portion of Control
Panel for the ISDN adapter) contains non-numeral characters (for example, a dash
"-").

The ISDN driver does not parse non-numeral characters out of the phone number
string correctly. This causes incoming calls to be ignored by the adapter.

WORKAROUND
==========

Don't use non-numeral characters in the phone number.

NOTE: When you try to change or remove the phone number, the ISDN setup program
does not delete the phone number correctly. If this happens, use one of the
following procedures:

Remove and Reinstall the ISDN Adapter Driver
--------------------------------------------

1. Remove the ISDN adapter driver from the Network portion of Control Panel.

2. Shutdown and restart your computer.

3. In Control Panel, add the ISDN driver back without entering a phone number.

4. Reconfigure RAS and restart your computer again.

Edit the Registry
-----------------

1. Start Registry Editor.

2. In the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree go to the following sub-key:

   SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Pcimac#

   where # is the network adapter number of the PCIMAC that has been installed.

3. Under this key there is a Paramters key with the following value(s):

   Line#.LTerm#.Address

   Delete all of the Line#.LTerm#.Address values.

   NOTE: Line# is the line number and LTerm# is the logical terminal number. The
   PCIMAC - ISA adapter which supports only one ISDN line will only have Line0.
   The PCIMAC/4 adapter with 4 ISDN lines will have lines numbered from 0 to 3.

4. Restart your computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft and Digiboard International are aware of the problems and are working
on a revised driver. We will post more information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
