TITLE   :Eight or More Clauses Causes Query Execution Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork smsgeneral kbArtTypeINF

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server version 1.0, when you attempt to run a query
consisting of eight or more clauses, the following error message appears in the
Query Results dialog box:

   Query Execution Error

In Systems Management Server version 1.2, the following error message may
appear:

   The specified query is too complex. This query exceeds SQL Server's 8 table
   limit. You might be to simplify this query by removing AND clauses.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because of the 16-table limit from SQL Server. Querying
eight or more clauses calls eight references to the particular table as well as
eight instances of the machine data table, thus reaching the 16- table limit.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 1.0.

This problem was corrected in Systems Management Server version 1.1.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 1.2.
