SYMPTOMS
========

A user account can have permissions to connect to network printers via Print
Manager. However, Print Manager may be missing the "Connect To" icon, and the
"Connect to Printer" option under the Printer menu may be unavailable.
Therefore, the user can only connect to a network printer via the MS-DOS command
prompt.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

1. Start User Profile Editor.

2. Enable the option to allow Print Manager connections to printers.
