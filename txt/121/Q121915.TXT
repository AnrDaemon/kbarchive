======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Connection Gateway, version 1.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to launch the Microsoft Mail Connection MACGATE.EXE program with an
invalid entry in the MSGATE.INI file, you may get an error similar to the
following:

   exiting on 06-15-94 06:24:33 with status 70 (118)

CAUSE
=====

The above error may be caused by the following situations:

1. This error is generated when the following MSGATE.INI lines

         User = Admin
         Password = Password

   accidentally get placed on the same line, as shown below

         User = Admin Password = Password

2. You have enhanced security enabled on your version 3.x Microsoft Mail for PC
   Network postoffice.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. This can easily be remedied by editing the MSGATE.INI file.

   NOTE: If you edit it, be sure that you do not leave a space at the end of the
   User = Admin line; this will be interpreted as an incorrect administrative
   mailbox name. A trailing space will not show up on a visual inspection of the
   MSGATE.INI file so you should double check this when you edit the file.

2. The 1.0b Connection Gateway was not enhanced security aware so you must
   re-run the Setup program for Microsoft Mail to turn off enhanced security
   before the Connection Gateway will run properly.
