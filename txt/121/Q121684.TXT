When a FoxPro for MS-DOS report containing box objects is printed under FoxPro

are printed under FoxPro for Windows.

 - Before printing the report, set the printer font to FoxFont as follows:

         SET PRINT FONT "FOXFONT",12

   -or-

 - Transport the FoxPro for MS-DOS reports before printing them under FoxPro for
   Macintosh.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
