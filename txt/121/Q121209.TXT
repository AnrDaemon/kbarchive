MIDIIO allows viewing of MIDI input messages in raw form or with text
descriptions. MIDI messages can be sent using the mouse or from dialog controls.
MIDI input and output devices are selected from the application menu. Multiple
instances of MIDIIO can be run to demonstrate MIDI device sharing between
applications. Wrapper functions encapsulate low-level MIDI APIs, handle errors,
and simplify application code. Macros are provided for building MIDI messages to
be sent by calling midiOutShortMsg().
