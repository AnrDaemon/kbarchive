SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade or perform a new installation of Windows NT Workstation and
Windows NT Server version 3.5 with a 3Com EtherLink III (3C509) adapter, Setup
may not correctly detect the settings for the network card. If you continue with
the installation and do not verify the settings, the following error message may
appear when you start your computer:

   At least one service or driver failed during system startup.

Event ID: 5003
Source: ELNK31
Type: Error
Description: Could not find an adapter.

The automatic detection of network adapters in Windows NT may alter the
non-volatile memory (NV RAM) on the 3Com EtherLink III network adapter, which
the 3Com network adapter Setup utility cannot correct in interactive mode.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, the following is recommended:

1. In Windows NT version 3.5, remove all installed network software and the
   network adapter card driver.

2. Boot to MS-DOS and use the 3Com EtherDisk utility version 3.0 (3C5X9CFG.EXE)
   by typing the following at the MS-DOS command prompt:

   3c5x9cfg configure /xcvr: X

   where X is TP, COAX or AUI. For additional valid configuration commands, type
   the following at the MS-DOS command prompt:

   3c5x9cfg configure /?

3. In Windows NT version 3.5, manually select the network adapter driver. Do not
   select the "autodetect" function.

4. Manually configure the network card with any setting (for IRQ, Base I/O
   Address and Tranceiver type). Then re-configure the network card with correct
   settings.

5. Restart your computer.

The EtherLink III is manufactured by 3Com Corporation, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
