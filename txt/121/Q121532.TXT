TITLE   :NCB_CALL Using Group Names Fails on TCP/IP-32
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER::3.11; WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When certain applications (for example, ICL TeamOFFICE, a groupware
communications application) run on a Windows for Workgroups 3.11 workstation,
connections with a Windows NT version 3.5 or Windows NT version 3.1 server
cannot be created when the 32-bit stack is in use. With the older 16-bit TCP/IP
stack, connections with both Windows NT version 3.5 and Windows NT version 3.1
are possible.

CAUSE
=====

The problem only occurs if the applications attempting to communicate with each
other are using NetBIOS group names. If unique NetBIOS names are used, the
problem cannot be reproduced.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in TCP/IP-32. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.

ICL TeamOFFICE is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
