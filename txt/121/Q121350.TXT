======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Commands that use the CTRL key (for example, CTRL+F4 or CTRL+HOME) do not work.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when Windows is using the KEYBOARD.DRV and *VKD drivers
and the keyboard driver selected in Windows Setup differs from the type in use.
(For example, Setup displays "All AT type keyboards [84--86 keys]" when the
keyboard in use is actually a 101-key keyboard.)

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the keyboard driver in Windows Setup to match the type of keyboard in
use. Most keyboards with 12 function keys use the "Enhanced 101- or 102- key
U.S. and Non-U.S. keyboards" driver.
