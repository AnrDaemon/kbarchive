TITLE   :CONN: Space After User=Admin in MSGATE.INI Causes Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For Appletalk Networks
PROD/VER::1.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Connection Gateway, version 1.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to launch version 1.0b of the Microsoft Mail Connection MACGATE.EXE
program when the administrative mailbox name on the User = line in the
MSGATE.INI file is followed by one or spaces will result in an error similar to
the following:

   2 - Cannot verify logon user/admin ID. Authorization failure.
   Bad parameter value. (110): 158
   exiting on 06-15-94 06:25:53 with status 158 (118)

RESOLUTION
==========

Edit the MSGATE.INI file to remove the trailing space(s). A trailing space will
not show up on a visual inspection of the MSGATE.INI file so you should double
check this when editing the file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The above error can also result from using an invalid or non-administrator
mailbox name on the User = line of the MSGATE.INI or from attempting to access a
postoffice where the Enhanced Security feature is installed.

Additional query words: 1.00b
