======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Maximizer for Windows 1.1 in Windows 95, it cannot find its
databases.

CAUSE
=====

Maximizer for Windows does not recognize network paths that use the universal
naming convention (UNC).

NOTE: The following example illustrates the UNC. The UNC path for a shared
directory called SHARE on a server called TEST is \\Test\Share.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can work around this problem with the following steps:

1. Create a persistent connection to the machine that contains the Maximizer
   databases.

2. Open the MAXWIN.INI file and change

   [Directory]
   DBases=\\<MachineName>\<ShareName>\<PathName>

   to

   [Directory]
   DBases=<x>:\<path to the Maximizer databases>

   where <x>: is the drive letter specified in step 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although this article discusses Maximizer for Windows, the workaround provided
can also be used for other applications that do not recognize UNC names.
However, it is helpful only if the application in question allows you to
designate the path (in an .INI file for example).
