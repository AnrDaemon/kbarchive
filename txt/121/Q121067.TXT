SUMMARY
=======

When you upgrade to an English version of MS-DOS 6.21 or 6.22 over an existing
installation of a non-English-language version of MS-DOS 6.0, some files may not
be updated correctly and therefore remain in the non-English language.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following files found in an MS-DOS 6.0 non-English-language installation are
not updated correctly when upgrading to the English version of MS-DOS 6.21 or
6.22:

MWBACKUP.DLL, MWBACKR.DLL, MWBACKUP.EXE, MWBACKUP.HLP, VFINTD.386,
MSBACKDB.OVL, MSBACKDR.OVL, MSBACKFB.OVL, MSBACKFR.OVL, MSBACKUP.EXE,
MSBACKUP.HLP, MSBACKUP.OVL, MSBCONFG.HLP, MSBCONFG.OVL, MSTOOLS.DLL,
DBLWIN.HLP

To update these files, manually expand the corresponding files found on the
original MS-DOS 6.21 or 6.22 English versions to the same directory. This
overwrites the existing non-English files.

Additional query words: 6.22 foreign french
