SYMPTOMS

When you set one SNA Server in a domain to log events to a remote SNA Server in
that domain, the remote system becomes unstable. After any remote logging is
done, the following error message appears on the remote SNA Server when any
RPC-aware process runs:

   The RPC service is too busy to service this request.

This problem may occur when SNA Server runs under Windows NT or Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1 with U.S. Service Pack 2 for Windows NT and Windows
NT Advanced Server installed.
