The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to run any application located on a Netware server by way of the
Gateway Service for Netware, the Netware server may stop responding (hang) and
display the following message:

   1.1.141 Secondary Interrupt Controller detected a lost hardware interrupt.

CAUSE
=====

The Netware operating system displays this message whenever it detects a lost
hardware interrupt. Lost interrupts occur when a driver or a board requests a
service with an interrupt call and then drops the request before the CPU can
respond to the request.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, the following procedure is recommended:

1. Check for outdated drivers loading on the Netware server.

2. Unload all the drivers and reload them one at a time to isolate which driver
   (and/or adapter) is causing the problem. Then contact the vendor of the
   driver.

3. If the error is non-fatal, the message can be turned off by using the
   following command either in the STARTUP.NCF file or from the command prompt:

   set display lost interrupt alerts=off
