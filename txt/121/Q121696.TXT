-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Space Simulator for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If Space Simulator is started by typing "spacesim" (without the quotation marks)
at the X:\SPACESIM prompt (where X is your hard drive), Space Simulator will not
generate sound.

CAUSE
=====

This is because the portion of the program that handles sounds is not loaded by
SPACESIM.EXE.

RESOLUTION
==========

Typing "ss1" (without the quotation marks) at the X:\SPACESIM prompt starts
Space Simulator and initializes the portion of the program that handles sound
effects and music playback.

Additional query words: 1.00 Spacesim sim dos ss1 D_SpaceSim ss1.bat
