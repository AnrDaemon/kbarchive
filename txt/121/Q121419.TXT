-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c, 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In FoxPro for Macintosh, the ALT+<hot key> key combination does not choose
a push button like it does in Windows even if KEYCOMP is set to WINDOWS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 107 of the FoxPro for Macintosh "Language Reference" manual says that if
KEYCOMP is set to WINDOWS, hot keys are underlined. This is true, but
ALT+<hot key> does not select the push button when another GET object,
edit region, list box, or popup is currently selected. However, if a radio
button is the active GET object, pressing SHIFT and the underlined letter will
choose the push button. Hot keys on the Macintosh function more like hot keys
under FoxPro for MS-DOS. This behavior is described on page 106.

If the push button GET is currently selected, pressing the hot key without ALT
will choose the push button.

If KEYCOMP is set to MAC, hot keys are not underlined, and push buttons can be
chosen only with the mouse.

NOTE: Pressing CTRL+ALT+<hot key> in the FoxPro for Macintosh is equivalent
to pressing ALT+<hot key> in FoxPro for Windows.
