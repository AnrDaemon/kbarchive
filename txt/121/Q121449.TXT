TITLE   :BUG: SQL Server: Certain Outer Joins Can Cause SQL_ERROR
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbBug kbISS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG# Addon_Bugs: 10175 (2.00.1912)

SYMPTOMS
========

A left outer join between two tables with two columns from each table
participating in the outer join will generate a syntax error. This happens when
the outer join escape clause is used.

SQLExecDirect
-------------

   SELECT * FROM {oj testoj1 LEFT OUTER JOIN testoj2 ON
                     testoj1.col1= testoj2.col1
                        AND
                        testoj1.col2 = testoj2.col2}

This generates the syntax error:

   SQLSTATE = 37000 NativeError = 102
   ErrorMsg =[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server] Incorrect syntax
   near '*='."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the ODBC SQL Server Driver
version 2.00.1912. This problem does not occur in any 1.x version drivers. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
