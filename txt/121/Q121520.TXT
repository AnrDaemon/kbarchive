SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Windows NT Backup program (NTBACKUP.EXE) with an Adaptec 1540CF
SCSI controller and an Exabyte 8500 tape drive, the following error message may
appear:

   Fatal error on drive 1

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the on-board termination on the Adaptec 1540CF SCSI
controller is not properly disabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Adaptec 1540CF SCSI controller has a software option for on-board
termination instead of physical resistor terminators. To perform the error- free
backup, the on-board termination on this SCSI card needs to be fully disabled
with the software option. For additional information regarding the software
option, call Adaptec Technical Support at (800) 959-7274.
