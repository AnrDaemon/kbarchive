TITLE   :Second CD-ROM Drive Not Detected in Windows 95

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows 95 on a system with two CD-ROM drives, one of the
CD-ROM drives is not detected.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when Windows 95 loads protected-mode drivers for one of the
CD-ROM drives and the second CD-ROM drive is running with real-mode drivers
loading in the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. Windows 95 assumes that the
real-mode and protected-mode drivers reference the exact same drive; therefore,
it assigns the drive letter for the protected-mode drive to be the same as the
existing real-mode drive letter.

RESOLUTION
==========

Assign the CD-ROM drive running in protected mode to a different drive letter.

You can change the drive letter of a CD-ROM drive by performing the following
steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the System icon, then click the Device Manager tab.

3. Select the CD-ROM you want to change from the list, then click the Properties
   button.

4. Click the Settings tab.

5. In the Reserved Drive Letters section, set Start Drive Letter and End Drive
   Letter to the drive letter you want the CD-ROM to use. Click the OK button.

6. Click the Start button on the taskbar and click Shut Down. Then click Restart
   The Computer.

The CD-ROM drive letter should now be the letter you selected and the second
CD-ROM should be accessible.

To change the drive letter of the CD-ROM using MSCDEX, use the MSCDEX /L: switch
on the MSCDEX line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. For example, inserting a /L:E on
the MSCDEX line would change the drive letter of the of the CD-ROM using MSCDEX
to E.
