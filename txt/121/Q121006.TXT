The information in this article applies to:

Microsoft Windows NT 3.5 DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) Server
and Client do not support option overlays to expand the DHCP packet beyond
548 bytes, but only up to 336 bytes. This is enough space for a reasonable
set of options.

If a non-Microsoft DHCP server is sending the option overlays, make sure
they all fit in the standard options field. If that is not possible, make
sure that those used by the Microsoft clients fit in.

Additional query words: prodnt Netbt tcpip
