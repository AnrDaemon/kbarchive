-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing MS-DOS Upgrade or MS-DOS StepUp, the following error
message is displayed:

   SETUP ERROR DETECTED

   The following disk error was detected. The listed file was not copied.

   Error reading --> COMMAND.DAT

   To exit Setup, press ENTER.

CAUSE
=====

The Uninstall process of Setup displays the above error message when it is
trying to copy C:\COMMAND.COM to A:\COMMAND.DAT on the Uninstall disk.

This error occurs when COMMAND.COM is cross-linked with another file, has
allocation unit errors, or there is a bad sector on the disk.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can correct this problem by replacing the COMMAND.COM file. Copy the
COMMAND.COM file from your DOS directory over the existing COMMAND.COM file in
the root directory using the following commands:

   attrib -r command.com

   ren command.com command.old

   copy c:\dos\command.com c:\command.com

NOTE: If the Uninstall portion of setup is bypassed by using the SETUP /G switch,
the error does not occur. Also, using CHKDSK /F or SCANDISK may allow you to
work around this problem.
