TITLE   :Unable to Browse or Connect to Microsoft Networking Print Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In some cases Browsing and Connecting to Windows NT and/or Windows 95 Network
Printers may not function correctly. The Browse list will be blank and if a
direct path is entered for Connect To Printer, one of the following error
messages appears:

   Could not connect to printer. The printer name is invalid.

   -OR-

   Cannot locate network printer name


CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by the Order value in the Print\Providers section in the
Registry not containing the correct entries. Rather than correctly listing
"LanMan Print Services," "Microsoft Windows Network" is listed instead. This
causes the LanMan Provider key, which specifies the dynamic-link library (DLL)
to be used for LanMan print shares, to not be found and thus Print Manager is
unable to Browse or Connect to Windows NT Printer Shares.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct both the Browsing and Connect to problems, change the Registry entry
to the correct provider. In the Registry, use the following path:

   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
   problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
   Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
   Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Providers

In the Order value, remove the following entry:

Microsoft Windows Network

Then add the following entry:

LanMan Print Services

There may also be an entry for NetWare printer shares; that does not need to be
removed or changed.
