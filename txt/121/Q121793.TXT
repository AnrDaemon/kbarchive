TITLE   :Err Msg: The DOS Sockets TSR is Not Loaded
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER::3.11; WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a Windows Sockets application after the installation of TCP/IP- 32
on a Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 computer, the following error message
may appear:

   The DOS Sockets TSR is not loaded.

When you choose the OK button, the following error message appears and the
application quits:

   Net3021E: NetAPI TCP/IP driver failed to load.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when an application or system is trying to use the real mode
version of Windows Sockets DLL. Previous DLL versions that were distributed with
Microsoft LAN Manager (for example, WIN_SOCK.DLL and WSOCKETS.DLL) are not
supported by Microsoft TCP/IP-32. In order for a Windows Sockets application to
function with Microsoft TCP/IP-32, the application must support Windows Sockets
version 1.1 (WINSOCK.DLL).

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the real mode version of the Windows Sockets DLL file, and contact the
manufacturer of the Windows Sockets application to determine if it supports
Windows Sockets version 1.1.
