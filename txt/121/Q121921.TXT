The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows NT Backup program sometimes displays and logs a time different than
the actual local time at your computer. This only occurs in countries with a
daylight saving time (DST) schedule different from the United States' DST.

Backup does not take the actual DST settings on a computer into account, but
instead always assumes U.S. DST to be in effect.

The result is that when you run Backup in a country with a different DST from the
U.S., during the overlapping period, an incorrect time is reported in the Backup
log.

Daylight saving time in the U.S. is active between the first Sunday in April and
the last Sunday in October. Daylight saving time in the Netherlands is also
active between the first Sunday in April and the last Sunday in October:

Some countries use a shorter daylight saving schedule, however. Because Backup
assumes U.S. residency, incorrect times are displayed in countries that do not
have daylight savings time or are on a different schedule for daylight savings
time. Times are reported as expected when the time schedules are back in
synchronization.

Example
-------

   Current date :
   Current time : 11

Backup reports 12 as the current time.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. A fix to
this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.
