TITLE   :PRB: Error C2858: Command-line Options Inconsistent
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When building a file from an existing application that uses precompiled header
files, the compiler produces the following error if the source drive letter has
changed:

   error C2858: command-line option 'program database name
   (/FdN:\test.pdb)' inconsistent with precompiled header,
   which used '/FdM:\test.pdb'

CAUSE
=====

The compiler stores and uses an absolute path to the precompiled header file,
not a relative path.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft recommends that you rebuild an application when moving its source code
or when connecting with a different drive letter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample code demonstrates the behavior. If the two files shown
below are compiled from the M: drive and later TEST2.CPP is compiled from the N:
drive, the error will occur.

Sample Code
-----------

   /* Compile options needed: /Zi /Fp"test.pch" /Yc
      TEST1.CPP
   */ 

   #include <iostream.h>

   void main()
   {
   }

   /* Compile options needed: /Zi /Fp"test.pch" /Yu"iostream.h"
      TEST2.CPP
   */ 

   #include <iostream.h>

   void sub()
   {
   }
