TITLE   :Can No Longer Access .CAL Filename That Includes a Space

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You create a .CAL file that includes a space in the filename (for example, JOHN
DOE.CAL), and later Schedule+ does not allow access to this file. The following
error message is displayed

   <JOHN DOE.CAL>
   This filename is invalid.

where <JOHN DOE.CAL> is the filename containing a space.

CAUSE
=====

Schedule+ allows the creation of a .CAL file with a space in the filename if you
are working offline and if you have not yet set up Mail. (Mail does not allow a
Mailbox entry that includes a space to be established.) When you start Schedule+
for the first time, it prompts you for a Mailbox entry. It is possible to
include a space in this entry. Schedule+ continues to work; however, if Mail is
later installed, Schedule+ cannot access the .CAL file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

 - Rename the file at the MS-DOS command prompt. For example:

   REN JOHN?DOE.CAL JOHNDOE.CAL

   -or-

 - If the .CAL file contains no data, delete the file. For example:

   DEL JOHN?DOE.CAL

If information is needed from this file, export the file and re-import the file
under the new mailbox name, which does not contain a space.

If Mail has been started and Schedule+ no longer allows access to the .CAL file,
you must rename the MSMAIL.INI and MSMAIL.MMF files, restart Schedule+, and
export the .CAL file.
