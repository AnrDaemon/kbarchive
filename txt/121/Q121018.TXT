TITLE   :PRB: Special Characters in Path Cause NMake Error U1007
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::2.0,2.1,4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbide kbVC

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Workbench for Windows, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 2.0, 2.1, 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Building a project that uses one of the special characters shown below works
correctly in the Visual Workbench. But an attempt to build the same project from
a command session fails, returning this error:

   test.mak(98) : fatal error U1007: double quotation mark not allowed in name
   Stop.

CAUSE
=====

This is limitation of the NMAKE utility included with the products listed above.
The following legitimate characters cause this problem:

   $, %, @, #, !, ^, (, ), {, }, [, ], -, and the space character.

When one of them is used in a path specification, Visual C++ puts quotation marks
around the file specification in several places within the makefile. NMAKE
cannot process files specified in this way.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Avoid using any of these special characters.

-or-

 - Modify the makefile to remove the quotation marks and use the project as an
   external makefile when using the Visual C++ Workbench to launch the build.

-or-

 - Always use the Visual C++ Workbench to build the project.
