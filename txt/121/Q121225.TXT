The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you run the MEM /C and MEM /D commands with MS-DOS 6.22, they report
different names for the same driver found in memory (DRVSPACE.BIN) even though
both commands reference DRVSPACE. This can be confusing when you are attempting
to determine if either DBLSPACE.BIN or DRVSPACE.BIN is being loaded into
memory.

The following example shows the information reported by MEM /C and MEM /D:

MEM /C
------

   Modules using memory below 1 MB:
   Name      Total          =    Conventional   +    Upper Memory
   HIMEM     1,104   (1K)        1,104   (1K)        0      (0K)
   EMM386    4,144   (4K)        4,144   (4K)        0      (0K)
   DRVSPACE  39,680  (39K)       0       (0K)        39,680 (39K)

MEM /D
------

   Conventional Memory Detail:
   Segment   Total          Name           Type
             1,088   (1K)   XMSXXXX0       Installed Device=HIMEM
             4,128   (4K)   EMMQXXX0       Installed Device=EMM386

   Upper Memory Detail:
   Segment   Region  Total          Name        Type
                     39,632  (39K)  DBLSYSH$    Installed Device=DRVSPACE
                                    or DBLSBIN$

Although the Name reference in the different commands is different, both commands
reference DRVSPACE. MEM /C references it in the Name field; MEM /D references it
in the Type field.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MEM /C command classifies programs by memory usage, lists the size of
programs, provides a summary of memory in use, and lists largest memory block
available.

The MEM/D command displays status of all modules in memory, internal drivers, and
other information.
