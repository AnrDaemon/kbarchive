SUMMARY
=======

There is a documentation error in the third-party book "Exploring Creative
Writer" published by Addison-Wesley.

On page 114, under "Tips and Hints," tip 2 incorrectly states that you should use
SHIFT+OPTION+A to get to Control Room on the Macintosh. The correct key
combination is: "SHIFT+COMMAND+A" (without the quotation marks). This is
correctly documented on the poster that ships with Creative Writer, printed by
Microsoft.
