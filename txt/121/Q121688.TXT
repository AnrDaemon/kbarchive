SUMMARY
=======

If you have a ThrustMaster Mark II Weapons Control System (WCS), you can use the
SPACESIM.ADV file found in your Space Simulator directory to configure your
hardware for use with Space Simulator. This assigns many frequently used
features in Space Simulator to controls on the WCS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use the SPACESIM.ADV file to configure your Mark II WCS, you must have the
updated chip and microcode from ThrustMaster. To determine if you have the
updated chip and microcode, type the following at the C:\MARK2 prompt and press
ENTER:

   dir *.exe

If MK2LOAD.EXE is included in the list of files reported, you have the updated
chip and microcode. If you do not have the updated chip and microcode, you can
obtain it by contacting ThrustMaster at (503) 639-3200.

Consult the Mark II WCS documentation for information about using the MK2LOAD.EXE
file to download configuration files to the Mark II WCS.
