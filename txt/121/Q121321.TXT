SUMMARY
=======

The Help File documentation for CDocTemplate::CreateNewFrame() says:

   If the pDoc parameter is NULL, a new document will be created
   if the appropriate runtime class is available; otherwise the
   new view will be associated with the ...

This is not correct. Calling CreateNewFrame() with a NULL pDoc parameter actually
results in an assertion failure on the pDoc pointer and a TRACE() statement in
your output or debug window stating the following:

   ASSERT_VALID fails with NULL pointer.

The reason for this is that CreateNewFrame() is not the appropriate function to
call when you don't have a pre-constructed CDocument-derived object. The
function to call is CMultiDocTemplate's or CSingleDocTemplate's
OpenDocumentFile(). The OpenDocumentFile() function creates a new CDocument
object by using CreateNewDocument().

MORE INFORMATION
================

CMultiDocTemplate:: and CSingleDocTemplate::OpenDocumentFile() both create a new
document if the pointer argument passed to them is NULL. To get a pointer to the
appropriate document template that you can use when calling OpenDocumentFile(),
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q106455 Acquiring a List of All CDocument Objects

This article contains sample code you can use to traverse the list of available
document templates.

This problem was fixed in Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, version 4.0.
