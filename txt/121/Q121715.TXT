-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 3.5 
 - Microsoft Mail for Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a Windows NT version 3.5 Workstation or Server sends mail to or receives
mail from a Microsoft Mail client, you receive the following error message:

   Mail System Error

   Mail could not read the entire message from the post office.
   Some parts of the message may be missing.
   Ask sender to resend the message.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT Workstation and Server Mail client incorrectly zeros out some
fields in the .MAI file.


RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft fixed this problem in an updated version of the Windows NT file,
MSSFS32.DLL.

To apply MSSFS32.DLL:

1. Download the self-extracting archive file, MSSFS32.EXE.

2. Copy the file to the WINNT\SYSTEM32 directory on your hard drive.

3. Rename the original MSSFS32.DLL to MSSFS32.OLD.

4. Type the command "MSSFS32.EXE" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER.

5. Restart your computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Windows NT Server version 3.5. An updated version of MSSFS32.DLL is now
available. However, the new file, MSSFS32.DLL has not been fully
regression-tested. Microsoft does not recommend implementing it without first
testing it in a trial environment. Use of the updated MSSFS32.DLL file is at
your own risk.
