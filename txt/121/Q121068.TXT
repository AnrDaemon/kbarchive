======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Remove Directory command (RMDIR or RD) removes read-only directories without
generating a warning message or error.

CAUSE
=====

Before a directory can be removed using the RD or RMDIR command, all files and
subdirectories, including any files or subdirectories with set attributes
(Read-Only, System, Hidden, and/or Archive) must be deleted. However, when the
directory itself has a Read-Only attribute set, RMDIR or RD deletes the empty
directory with no warning or error messages.

The ATTRIB <file or directory> +R command sets Read-Only attributes to
files and directories. The RMDIR and RD commands ignore any ATTRIB-set
attributes (Read-Only, System, Hidden, Archive) directories.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS versions 3.3x, 4.x, 5.x,
6.0, 6.2, 6.21, and 6.22. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
