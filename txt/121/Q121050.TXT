Modifying the Registry
----------------------

   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
   problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
   Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
   Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start the Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE)

2. Find the following key:

   \HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft \Mail\Microsoft Mail

3. From the Edit menu, select Add Value.

4. For the Value Name field, type "Password" (without quotation marks). Select
   REG_SZ for Data Type and choose OK. For the String value, type the user's
   password and choose OK.

5. Close the Registry Editor, and restart Mail32.

Modifying Program Item Properties
---------------------------------

1. Highlight the MSMail32 program item.

2. Press ALT+ENTER to display the MSMail32 program item properties.

   MSMAIL32.EXE <username> <password>
