SUMMARY
=======

When a Toshiba Laptop 4600c or T6400DXC is docked, it is not possible to print
locally through the parallel port unless the port is set to Output.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This has been tested specifically with Toshiba Laptop 4600c model PA1202U and
docking station model PA2701U. It is possible to print locally with the parallel
port set to Bi-directional rather than Output if the laptop is not in the
docking station. The Toshiba 3600 does not print under Windows NT version 3.5
when the parallel port is set to Bi-directional mode in CMOS. This applies
whether the Toshiba 3600 is in or out of the docking station.

Tests with Toshiba Laptop T6400DXC have shown that you can get to Setup by
pressing the F1 key during bootup.

To set the parallel port to Output:

1. Boot to MS-DOS and run TSetup.

2. Select Parallel Port.

3. If Parallel Port is set to Bi-directional, press SPACEBAR to change it to
   Output.

4. Save the settings.

NOTE: It is not necessary to change this setting for MS-DOS or Windows for
Workgroups printing.

The Toshiba products discussed here are manufactured by Toshiba America, Inc., a
vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
