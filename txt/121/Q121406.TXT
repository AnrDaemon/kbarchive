WINDOWS

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to start a service from the Services portion of Control Panel,
the following error message may appear:

   The process cannot switch to the startup current directory
   <C:\WINNT>\SYSTEM32\. Select OK to set the current directory to
   C:\WINNT or Cancel to exit.

NOTE: <C:\WINNT> is the location of the Windows NT system files.

After choosing OK, another message appears:

   Could not start xxxx service on \\<ComputerName>
   Error 0005: Access is Denied

NOTE: xxxx is the name of the service you are attempting to start and
<ComputerName> is the name of your computer.

CAUSE
=====

You do not have the appropriate directory permissions to access the SYSTEM32
directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid these errors, the system administrator must grant you the appropriate
rights to the directories that contain files required to start the services and
any directories used by the services. (For example, the Directory Replication
service requires that the replication user account has at least read and execute
permissions for the SYSTEM32 directory).
