To ensure a reliable Remote Access Service (RAS) connection when using a
wide area network (WAN) connection (for example, a communications or X.25
port) the speed of the link may require that you load less protocols.

At lower speed links (2400 through 9600 bps) only one LAN protocol should
be used. IP, IPX, and NetBEUI can run simultaneously with RAS. All three
protocols are supported at all speeds and can be activated; however, using
all three protocols at the same time at low speeds is not recommended. One
protocol will remain active, but the others may fail. The RAS connection
will remain, but only the most robust protocol will continue to operate.

IP is the most robust network protocol for WAN links, followed by IPX and
NetBEUI.

On higher speeds links (56 through 64 Kbps and up) two or three transport
protocols can be supported simultaneously without difficulty.
