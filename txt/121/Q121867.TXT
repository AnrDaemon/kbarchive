SUMMARY
=======

Page 11 of the Microsoft Mail version 3.2 "Administrator's Guide" incorrectly
states that when a postoffice is updated, the Setup program backs up all the
Mail system files, then removes them when the backup is successful. It asks that
there be enough disk space on the server equal to the amount currently occupied
by the server and client programs and the postoffice data files. However, the
Setup program does not create a backup of the entire database, and therefore, it
does not require as much disk space as it claims.

Additional query words: 3.20
