When you use the NET USE command across a router using TCP/IP-32 and
encounter problems, the following troubleshooting techniques are
recommended:

1. Make sure you ping across both sides of the router. This tests to make sure
   the router is configured and working properly.

2. Check to make sure you have an entry in the LMHOSTS file that lists the
   NetBIOS name and IP address of the machine across the router. See the
   LMHOSTS.SAM file for a description and example LMHOSTS file entries.

3. Make sure the Enable LMHOSTS Lookup check box is selected in the Advanced
   Microsoft TCP/IP configuration dialog box. This is located in the Network
   group; choose the Network Setup icon, and then double-click Microsoft
   TCP/IP-32 3.11, Advanced.

4. If you are having trouble connecting from File Manager, but can connect fine
   from the MS-DOS command prompt, add the #PRE keyword to the LMHOSTS file
   entry. This is noted in the release notes. See the LMHOSTS.SAM file for an
   example of using the #PRE keyword.
