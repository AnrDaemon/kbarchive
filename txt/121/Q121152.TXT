KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you press the F3 key to exit the first screen of an MS-DOS 6.22
DoubleSpace-to-DriveSpace conversion, the following dialog box is
displayed:

   Quitting DriveSpace

   DriveSpace is not completely set up on your system. If you quit now, your hard
   disk will be unchanged; to compress it, you will need to run DriveSpace
   again. To quit now, press F3. To continue DriveSpace, press ENTER.

The dialog box suggests that you were attempting a compression rather than
a DoubleSpace-to-DriveSpace conversion. The dialog box should read as
follows:

   Quitting DriveSpace

   DriveSpace is not completely set up on your system. If you quit now, your hard
   disk will be unchanged; to convert it, you will need to run DriveSpace again.
   To quit now, press F3. To continue DriveSpace, press ENTER.

Additional query words: misleading error err msg
