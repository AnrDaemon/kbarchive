-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Space Simulator for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The error message "Error Loading 2D driver" may appear when you start Space
Simulator if the video configuration information is incorrect.

If, during Setup, either of the SVGA resolutions (640 x 400 or 800 x 600) are
chosen, you are required to select from a list of video cards and chipsets. If
the wrong chipset is selected, Space Simulator will not be able to communicate
properly and may generate the error message "Error Loading 2D driver."

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this situation:

1. Determine the appropriate chipset for the video card by consulting the
   manufacturer or the video card documentation.

2. Once the chipset has been determined, run Setup from the X:\SPACESIM MS-DOS
   prompt and select the desired resolution (where X is the drive on which your
   SPACESIM directory resides).

3. When prompted for the chipset information, select the appropriate option from
   the list. If the correct chipset is not listed, select option <0>, and
   Space Simulator will be configured for VGA resolution (320 x 200).
