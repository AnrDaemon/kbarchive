menu in Golf while you view a recorded round of Golf, the computer may stop
responding (hang).

MORE INFORMATION

the recorded player, or if Quick Start or New Game are chosen immediately after
starting Golf.

------------------

1. Start a new game.

2. In the Recorded Players section, select the Show Players box.

   picture of a camera will precede the player's name to denote a recorded game)
   by selecting the player's name and clicking Add Player.

4. The recorded player's name will now appear in the Players Selected box.

   will appear with the options of Pause or Continue. Click Pause (the Swing
   indicator will now appear as a large button with Continue on it).

   NOTE: Aim Shot, Rotate View, and Drop Ball are now unavailable (dimmed) in the
   Action menu.

   Start or New, You receive the message: "There is a game in progress: Do you
   wish to exit?" Click Yes.
