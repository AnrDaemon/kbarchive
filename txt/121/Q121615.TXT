The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 3.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

SNA Server 2.1 Data Sheet incorrectly lists the following host system
requirements:

 - VTAM Version 3 Release 2 or later

 - NCP Version 5 Release 2.1 or later

SNA Server is supported against earlier versions of NCP and VTAM software. The
above version levels were attempting to document host software levels necessary
to support independent LU6.2 communication. Dependent LU6.2 is supported by
earlier versions of NCP and VTAM software. While independent LU6.2 supports
parallel sessions over a single APPC LU, dependent LU6.2 is limited to a single
session per APPC LU.

There are no known NCP or VTAM version requirements to support host 3270
configurations or dependent LU6.2.
