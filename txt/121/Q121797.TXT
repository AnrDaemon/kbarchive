TITLE   :PC WSPlus:  Standard Response Buttons Unavailable
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,3.2,3.2a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a meeting request is received and the header of the message is incomplete or
is missing, any or all of the standard response buttons listed in the [Custom
Messages] section of the MSMAIL.INI file may not be complete.

CAUSE
=====

When Schedule+ version 1.0 is installed, it writes the following lines into the
[Custom Messages] section of the MSMAIL.INI:

     IPM.Microsoft Schedule.MtgReq=3.0 ;;;;SchedMsg.DLL;;1111100000000000;;;;

     IPM.Microsoft Schedule.MtgRespP=3.0;;;;SchedMsg.DLL;;1100100000000000;;;;

     IPM.Microsoft Schedule.MtgRespN=3.0;;;;SchedMsg.DLL;;1100100000000000;;;;

     IPM.Microsoft Schedule.MtgRespA=3.0;;;;SchedMsg.DLL;;1100100000000000;;;;

     IPM.Microsoft Schedule.MtgCncl=3.0 ;;;;SchedMsg.DLL;;1100100000000000;;;;

If these lines are not in the recipient's MSMAIL.INI file, the header information
and the buttons will not be available. If the lines are in the MSMAIL.INI file
and are later removed, any undeleted meeting request messages will still be
present and uncorrupted, but the header information and buttons will be
unavailable.

RESOLUTION
==========

Check the MSMAIL.INI file on the recipient's computer. If the above lines are
missing, add them to the MSMAIL.INI file. If this is unsuccessful, it is
possible that the SCHEDMSG.DLL file in the Windows subdirectory has been
corrupted.
