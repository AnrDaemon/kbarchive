TITLE   :PC Ext: Failure Delivering User Mail Due to Mailbag Contention
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the External Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE) encounters a mailbag contention
problem, the SYSTEM.LOG report generated may be incorrect. It is also possible
that no report will be generated and External may stop responding (hang or
crash).

If the report is generated, it may list recipients that actually did receive the
message rather than list only the recipient whose mailbag could not be accessed.

CAUSE
=====

These errors can occur when multiple recipients are specified for one postoffice
and one of the recipients experiences a delivery problem. As the External Mail
program tries to create the SYSTEM.LOG report, memory can be corrupted.

This problem does not occur for mail sent from user to user, within one
postoffice.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2.9 of the External
Mail program. This problem was corrected in version 3.2.12 of EXTERNAL.EXE. If
you do not have version 3.2.12 (or later), you can download EXTUPD.EXE, a
self-extracting file, on the following services:

 - Microsoft's World Wide Web Site on the Internet On the www.microsoft.com home
   page, click the Support icon.

   Click Knowledge Base, and select the product. Enter kbfile EXTUPD.EXE, and
   click GO!

   Open the article, and click the button to download the file.

   folder. Get EXTUPD.EXE

 - The Microsoft Network On the Edit menu, click Go To, and then click Other
   Location. Type "mssupport" (without the quotation marks).
