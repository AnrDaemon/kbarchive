The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to a Novell NetWare printer, one or both of the following
problems occur:

 - An extra page prints at the end of every print job.

 - A page with UserID information (a banner) prints before the print job.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct these problems, choose one of the methods below.

 - Change the printer settings from within Windows using the following steps:

   1. Open Control Panel and then choose the Printers icon.

   2. Choose the Connect button, then choose the Network button.

   3. Select the LPTx printer, then choose the Options button.

   4. Make sure the following printer options are NOT selected:

   Notify
   Form Feed
   Enable Tabs
   Enable Timeout
   Enable Banner

   5. Choose the OK button.

   6. (Optional) To maintain these settings every time Windows is started,
      select the Permanent option in the Network Printer Connections box.

      NOTE: If you select the Permanent option, the printer port selected is
      updated to reflect the selected options every time you start Windows.

   -or-

 - Change the printer settings before starting Windows with the steps below.

   At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following

   capture l=1 nb na ti=0 nff nt l=x

   where x is 1, 2, or 3 for LPT1, LPT2, or LPT3.

   NB = No Banner
   NA = No Autoendcap
   TI = 0 (disable time-out--a time-out of 60 is usually enough)
   NFF = No Form Feed (ejects a blank sheet after every print job)
   NT = No Tab expansion (expands tabs, garbles graphics)

   -or-

 - These changes can be made globally for all users on a server by editing the
   System Login Script. The System Login Script is changed by running the Novell
   NetWare SYSCON utility.
