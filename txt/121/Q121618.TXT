The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51

In order to save the default user profiles of a local system and make them
available to the domain, use the User Profile Editor. It is available in
Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1, Windows NT Server version 3.5, and
the Windows NT 3.1 Resource Kit. If you do not have any of these products,
and you have a Windows NT workstation, you can save your default user
profiles from a domain server.

In order to save a workstation's local default user profile and make it
available as a domain user profile from a domain controller, the following
procedure is recommended:

1. From the Windows NT server, create a domain user account for the Windows NT
   workstation and register the computer name on the domain.

2. From the Windows NT workstation, join the domain. When you have successfully
   joined the domain, log off of the computer.

3. From the Windows NT server, run the User Profile Editor and connect to the
   system root directory (C$) of the Windows NT workstation, using a domain
   administrator account name and password.

4. Make the workstation's default user profile available to the domain by saving
   the profile with a USR extension on the domain controller. Default user
   profiles are located in the %systemroot%\systems32\CONFIG (where %systemroot%
   is the root directory for Windows NT, usually WINNT) sub-directory, usually
   with the following format:

   <First 5 characters of user name>000

5. Open the new USR file with the User Profile Editor Tool, permit the new
   Domain user to use this profile.
