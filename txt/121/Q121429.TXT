TITLE   :Scenes 2.0: Cannot Interrupt Display of Thumbnails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Scenes (all collections), version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot select options or exit the Wallpaper dialog box until all the
wallpaper images have been drawn.

CAUSE
=====

When you press the Choose Wallpaper button, Scenes displays a pictorial listing
of the images for each collection. These small images are saved as *.THM files
in the \SCENES\PICSETS\<COLLECTION NAME> directory and are know as
thumbnail images.

The process of drawing the images in the dialog box cannot be interrupted. You
must wait until all the images are drawn before you can choose another
collection or apply an image as wallpaper. This can cause a long delay on slow
machines.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Scenes version 2.0. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
