PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print from a workstation on a Novell NetWare network, you receive the
following error message:

   LPTx: Windows cannot write to this file. The disk may be full.
   Delete any unwanted files and try again.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft has received reports that this behavior occurs when the workstation is
running PSPRINT.

PSPRINT does not support the "Fast Printing Direct to Port" option. PSPRINT is
functionally similar to RPRINTER, which allows a print queue to be set up for a
printer attached to a workstation instead of a dedicated print server.


WORKAROUND
==========

Disabling the "Fast Printing Direct to Port" option appears to correct this
problem. To change this option, perform the following steps:

1. Open Control Panel and choose the Printers icon.

2. Choose the Connect button.

3. Clear the "Fast Printing Direct to Port" option and then choose the OK
   button.

4. Choose the Close button.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
