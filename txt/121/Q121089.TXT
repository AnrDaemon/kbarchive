-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using an Artisoft Noderunner network card, you receive the
following error message

   ERROR: 2191 - You cannot stop the service you specified at this time.

when you start Windows for Workgroups or after you run the NET START FULL command
from an MS-DOS command prompt.

CAUSE
=====

By default, revisions of the Noderunner card earlier than 6 are not correctly
configured to work with Windows for Workgroups NE2000 or NE1000 drivers.
Revisions earlier than 6 come with a disk that configures this card to an NE1000
only.

RESOLUTION
==========

To properly configure this card for Windows for Workgroups:

 - Run the NRCONFIG.EXE or NRSETUP.EXE that ships with the card. In the
   configuration option, set the card to be NE1000 compatible. For full
   instructions on these files, contact Artisoft technical support.

   -or-

 - Contact Artisoft for the latest chip revision for the card. Chip revisions
   greater than 6 ship with a newer NRCONFIG.EXE or NRSETUP.EXE that allows the
   card to work with Windows for Workgroups 3.11 as either an NE1000 or an
   NE2000.
