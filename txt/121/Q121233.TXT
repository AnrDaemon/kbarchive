The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

When a form is assigned to more than one paper path, Print Manager locates the
first path that has that form assigned to it and prints to it. Print Manager
scans from the list of paper paths from the top down. If the form is assigned to
the lower paper tray while the upper tray was previously assigned to the same
form, Print Manager will always print to the upper paper tray.


WORKAROUND
==========

Manually remove references of undesired paper paths to the same form.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.1 and 3.5.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
