MORE INFORMATION
================

The most common cause of this error message is running in standard VGA mode
instead of 256-color Super VGA.

To check what resolution you are running in Windows 3.1, follow this procedure:

1. From the Program Manager, open the Main group.

2. In the Main group, double-click the Windows Setup icon.

3. View the Display line. If the Display line indicates VGA, then you will need
   to contact the manufacturer of your video card to determine which 256-color
   Super VGA display driver will function properly for your system.

Once you have determined which display driver will benefit you the best, you can
install the driver by choosing Change System Setting from the Options menu in
the Windows Setup dialog window.

NOTE: For further information regarding changing the display driver under Windows
3.1, please consult the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" or the manufacturer of
your video card.

To check what resolution you are running in Windows '95, follow this procedure:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Display icon.

3. Click the Settings tab. View the selection under the Color palette section.
   If the Display line indicates 16 color, then you will need to contact the
   manufacturer of your video card to determine if you are able to run the 256
   color option. If your system will run 256 colors, select this option followed
   my clicking OK.
