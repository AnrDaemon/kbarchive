SUMMARY
=======

Some printers have TrueType (TT) fonts built into the printer. Printer drivers
can increase their throughput by using the printer's internal TrueType device
fonts instead of downloading the fonts to the printer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To get an accurate representation of printer supported TrueType fonts on the
display, there must be an associated TT font that is installed on the system.
The printer manufacturer or driver developer has the responsibility of providing
TT fonts that match the printer's TT fonts. The TT fonts must be installed by
using the Control Panel Fonts or by using the respective Windows API
AddFontResource function.

The printer driver can then use the Enginexxxx functions that are documented in
the Windows version 3.1 DDK's DDAG31WH.HLP file.

The Enginexxxx functions are:

   EngineDeleteFont
   EngineEnumerateFont
   EngineGetCharWidth
   EngineGetGlyphBmp
   EngineRealizeFont
   EngineSetFontContext

The Enginexxxx functions are entry points into the Windows TT rasterizer. These
functions allow a printer driver to treat TT fonts as device fonts. By using its
EnumDFonts() function, a printer driver can enumerate all the TT fonts on the
system, compare them with the printer's TT fonts and return only the TT fonts
that match. Then in the printer driver's ExtTextOut() function, the Enginexxxx
realized TT font can be mapped to the printer's TT font and the associated
printer escapes can be sent to the printer instead of downloading a load of
raster data.
