The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

On a Windows for Workgroups (WfWG) version 3.11 computer with TCP/IP-32, if you
load NetBEUI into real mode (conventional memory) prior to starting Windows you
may encounter problems such as network errors, inability to make network
connections, other machines not able to connect to your shares, or your computer
may stop responding (hang) when attempting to make a network connection.

NOTE: To load NetBEUI into conventional memory, run the following command at the
command prompt prior to starting Windows, or add it to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

      Net Start NetBEUI

WORKAROUND
==========

Remove TCP/IP, or do not load NetBEUI in real mode.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups, and
TCP/IP-32. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
