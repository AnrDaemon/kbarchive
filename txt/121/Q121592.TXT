-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to an AS/400 through the SNA Server's Win5250
applet, the following error message may appear after the user name and password
are entered in the session level sign-on screen:

   Configuration Problem
   Allocation Error. Security Not Valid. RC 0003 080F6051.

CAUSE
=====

This error condition occurs when the AS/400 device security has been set
incorrectly.

NOTE: The following similar error message appears when the incorrect user name
and password are entered at the session level sign-on screen, but should not be
confused with the aforementioned error condition:

   The userid or password is not valid. Try again or contact your system
   administrator. Primary return code: 0003 Secondary return code: 080F6051

WORKAROUND
==========

To correctly sign on, the Limit Device Access value on the AS/400 needs to be
set to "0=Explicit device access not needed." In the failing condition, this
value will be set to "1= Explicit device access needed."

To check this value, do the following:

1. At the AS/400 Main menu, type WRKSYSVAL and then press ENTER. ("WRKSYSVAL"
   means Work with System Values.)

2. Scroll down the list to QLMTSECOFR and place a 5 on the adjacent line and
   then press ENTER.

3. At the Display System Value screen, change the Limit Device Access value to
   0.
