KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While displaying a low percentage rate of remaining battery life, the Battery
Meter utility reports that the battery status is HIGH.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the system has an advanced power management (APM) BIOS
version 1.0 installed. Because the BIOS returns the wrong information when it is
called, the Battery Meter utility reports battery status HIGH when the battery
is actually low.

STATUS
======

This problem has been confirmed to occur on the Compaq Contura Laptop computer
and may also occur on other Compaq computers using APM.

RESOLUTION
==========

Contact Compaq Corporation for information regarding an upgrade to the latest
version of the APM BIOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Compaq Contura Laptop computer is manufactured by Compaq Corporation, a
vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
