======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 2.0, 2.1, 4.0, 4.1 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using Visual C++ version 2.x, after you enter a very long string in the
Browser's Query on Name field, you may receive an error message with the
following information:

   MSVC.EXE - Application Error The instruction at "<hex_address1>"
   referenced memory at "<hex_address2>". The memory could not be "read".

Using Visual C++ version 4.x and later, you may receive an error message with the
following information:

   MSDEV.EXE - Application Error The instruction at "<hex_address1>"
   referenced memory at "<hex_address2>". The memory could not be "read".

CAUSE
=====

Strings entered in the Browser's Query on Name field that exceeds 253 characters
in Visual C++ version 2.x or 2876 characters in Visual C++ version 4.0 and later
causes this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the products listed at the beginning
of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++, version
6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Depending on the video mode, errors resulting from long strings may be displayed
in an error notification box that is partially off the screen. It may be unclear
what action to take. Press ENTER to clear the box.

Visual C++ 5.0 and later do not have a specific Query on Name field. To use this
feature, click Source Browser from the Tools menu. In Visual C++ 5.0 the problem
occurs when you enter the long string into the Identifier edit box.

Visual C++ 6.0 limits the amount of text that it accepts to approximately 900
characters. More than that will be truncated, but it will not generate an
application error.
