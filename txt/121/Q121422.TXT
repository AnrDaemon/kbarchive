The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The MS-DOS version 6.22 DRVSPACE.INI file supports all of the switches supported
by the MS-DOS versions 6.0 and 6.2 DBLSPACE.INI file, plus the following
additional switch:

   UseMRCI1=

MORE INFORMATION
================

This switch can be used as follows:

 - UseMRCI1=0

   If UseMRCI1=0, DRVSPACE.BIN does not look for DBLSPACE.BIN to load MRCI 1d
   (DRVSPACE.MR1) for reading DoubleSpace drives.

-or-

 - UseMRCI1=1

   If UseMRCI1=1, DRVSPACE.BIN tries to load the MRCI 1d.

The default value is 1. However, when this setting is 1, the MRCI 1d still does
not load unless the valid key file (DRVSPACE.MR1) is found.

To change MRCI 1d support:

 - Manually set UseMRCI1= to either 1 or 0 in the DRVSPACE.INI file.

-or-

 - From the Tools menu in the DriveSpace interface, choose Options, and select
   the Read DoubleSpace Drives check box.

-or-

 - Delete the DRVSPACE.MR1 key file on the boot drive (or copy to the boot
   drive).
