from any of the columns.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual FoxPro
-------------

1. Create a form with a ListBox in it.

2. Add the following code to the Init event of the ListBox:

         PUBLIC ARRAY test(1,2)
         * Define the two column array
         SELECT cust_id, company FROM customer INTO ARRAY test
         THIS.RowSource='test' && Ties the ListBox to the array
         THIS.RowSourceType=5 && Tells the ListBox what type of data its using
         THIS.ColumnCount=2   && In order to get other columns to show, you
                              &&  must have a column count greater than 1
         THIS.BoundColumn=2
         THIS.ColumnWidths= '0,' +STR(THIS.Width) && Setting the ColumnWidth
                            && property to 0, <some value> is the key to
                            && displaying the second column.

FoxPro 2.x
----------

NOTE: This example assumes that the CUSTOMER.DBF table has been installed in
FoxPro's TUTORIAL subdirectory.

To display any column of an array in a list or popup, use the Screen Builder to
perform the following:

1. In the Setup Code snippet of a test screen, type the following:

        SET DEFAULT to <FoxPro_directory>\tutorial
        SELECT company, city, state FROM customer INTO ARRAY a3colmns

2. Create a list or popup object. For a list, select the From Array radio
   button. For a popup, select the Array Popup radio option button.

3. Type A3COLMNS in the Array Popup text box.

4. In the Variable text box, type "M.COL" (without the quotation marks).

5. Choose 1st Element.

6. Verify that the Expression radio button is selected. Then type the number 1,
   2, or 3 in the text editing region. The number you type designates which of
   the three array columns will be displayed.

7. Generate and run the screen.

NOTE: The first column of the array contains COMPANY field data, the second
contains CITY field data, and the third contains STATE field data from the
CUSTOMER.DBF table.
