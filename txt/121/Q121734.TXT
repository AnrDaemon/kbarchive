TITLE   :PC Ext: SYS3175 MMTA Error in ASYNC.OVL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: OS/2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the External Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE) encounters a mailbag contention
problem, it tries to generate a report to go into the SYSTEM.LOG file. If the
message has more than three recipients on a postoffice, the External Mail
program may stop responding (hang or crash). In the OS/2 environment, the
following SYS3175 message can result:

   A program in this session encountered a problem and cannot continue.

If the report is generated, it may list recipients that actually did receive the
message rather than list only the recipient whose mailbag could not be
accessed.

Similar delivery problems, such as a corrupted or bad address, a bad group, or an
empty or missing mailbag, may also generate the SYS3175 error.

CAUSE
=====

These errors can occur when multiple recipients are specified for one postoffice
and one of the recipients experiences a delivery problem. As the External Mail
program tries to create the SYSTEM.LOG report, memory can be corrupted.

This problem does not occur for mail sent from user to user within one
postoffice.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2.9 of the External
Mail program. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
