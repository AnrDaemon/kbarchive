SYMPTOMS
========

Net Watcher indicates that another machine is attached, but it does not show
that a file is open when one actually is.

CAUSE
=====

Some applications open a file, read it into memory, and then close it to save
file handles. When the application needs to write to the file, it reopens it.
Examples of such applications are WordPad and Notepad.
