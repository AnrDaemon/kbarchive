TITLE   :Windows 95 Err Msg w/a DISTEC Drive: Missing Operating System
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Windows 95 reboots after Setup is complete, you receive the following error
message:

   Missing operating system

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs when your DISCTEC removable hard disk drive is set as
the boot drive.

DISCTEC removable hard disk drives set the CMOS to drive type 2. The DISCTEC
removable drive device driver (DISCTEC.SYS) then uses an INT 13 function 9 call
to reset the BIOS with the proper hard disk drive type. The hard disk drive type
is stored in the partition sector.

Windows 95, as well as some earlier versions of MS-DOS, rewrites the partition
sector when installed. This causes the code the DISCTEC device driver inserted
to be removed. Therefore, the BIOS can no longer identify the proper hard disk
drive type.

WORKAROUND
==========

 - If you have already installed Windows 95 and are receiving the above error
   message, perform the following steps:

   1. Boot your computer with a bootable floppy disk.

   2. Insert the DISCTEC installation disk in the floppy disk drive and change
      to this drive (A: or B:).

   3. Use DISCTEC's hard disk drive partitioning software to rewrite the
      partition table as follows:

   HDPRT /w /0

      NOTE: The last character above is a zero.

      You are returned to a drive prompt without any messages being displayed.
      This step works correctly as long as the formatting of the hard disk has
      not changed.

   4. Reboot your computer from the hard disk.

 - If you have not installed Windows 95 yet, perform the following steps:

   1. Manually set the CMOS to the proper hard disk drive type.

   2. Remove the DISCTEC.SYS device driver from the CONFIG.SYS file and reboot
      your computer.

   3. Install Windows 95.

   4. Reinstall the DISCTEC software.

If you continue to receive the above error message or experience other problems
with your DISCTEC removable drive, contact DISCTEC technical support at (407)
671-5500.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After booting from a floppy disk and attempting to access your hard disk drive,
you may encounter "Sector not found" error messages. To correct these errors,
make sure that the DISCTEC device driver (DISCTEC.SYS) is loading in the
CONFIG.SYS file on the floppy disk.

The DISCTEC removable hard disk drive is manufactured by Disk Technologies Corp.,
a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
