======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you install Windows NT version 3.5 on a Gateway 2000 machine with an NEC
260 CD-ROM drive (IDE CD-ROM), the Setup program does not detect it. Windows NT
version 3.5 supplies a driver for IDE CD-ROM drives that follow the ATAPI 1.2 or
higher specification. If you experience problems installing the Gateway-supplied
NEC 260 CD-ROM drive, call Gateway Technical Support at (800) 846-2301.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The documentation that is shipped with this Gateway package states that the NEC
260 CD-ROM drive follows the ATAPI 1.8 specification. The documentation should
state that the CD-ROM follows the ATAPI A1.8 specification, which is a
pre-release specification that has not been ratified by the ATAPI council.


NOTE: NEC also manufactures the CDR260R CD-ROM drive, which does conform to ATAPI
1.2 specification and works with Windows NT version 3.5. Starting in November
1994, Gateway 2000 began shipping the CDR260R rather than the CDR260 in its
computers.

The third-party products discussed here are manufactured by vendors independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
