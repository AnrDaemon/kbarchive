TITLE   :NBTSTAT -R Parameter May Fail in Microsoft TCP/IP-32
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER::3.11; WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The NBTSTAT -R command may not appear to function properly in Microsoft
TCP/IP-32. If you attempt to purge and reload the NetBIOS name cache using
NBTSTAT -R, the remote name table may be purged without reloading the NetBIOS
name cache from the LMHOSTS file.

The NBTSTAT -R command appears to function properly and generates the following
message:

   Successful purge and preload on the NBT Remote Cache Name Table.

However, the NBTSTAT -C command shows that the cache has been purged, but the
values in the LMHOSTS suffixed with #PRE have not been loaded.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can work around this problem by enabling the LmHostFile parameter in
SYSTEM.INI:

1. In the Network window, double-click the Network Setup icon, or use the arrow
   keys to select Network Setup, and then press ENTER.

2. In the Network Drivers dialog box, choose the Drivers button.

3. In the Network Drivers list, select Microsoft TCP/IP-32 3.11, and then choose
   the Setup button.

4. In the Microsoft TCP/IP-32 3.11 setup dialog box, choose the Advanced button,
   and then select the Enable LMHOSTS Lookup check box.

Note that this parameter is not enabled by default when you install Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11 with the Microsoft TCP/IP-32 protocol.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft TCP/IP-32. We are
researching this problem and will post new information in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
