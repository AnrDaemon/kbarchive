TITLE   :ADT2: Setup Wizard Cannot Find VSHARE.386 with Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Access Distribution Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Setup Wizard to create installation disks for your custom
application on a computer running Microsoft Windows NT, you may receive the
following error message:

   Can't find file 'C:\NT\SYSTEM\VSHARE.386'


CAUSE
=====

VSHARE.386 is a file-locking management file included with Microsoft Access
version 2.0. The Setup Wizard requires that this file be included on your
application's custom Setup disks in order for your run-time application to work
on a computer running Microsoft Windows version 3.1 or Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups version 3.1 or 3.11. However, because Microsoft Windows NT and
Windows 95 provide their own form of file locking, Microsoft Access Setup does
not install the VSHARE.386 file to computers running these operating systems.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, install the VSHARE.386 file from your original
Microsoft Access disks to your computer's NT\SYSTEM subdirectory. To install the
VSHARE.386 file, follow these steps:

1. Copy the DECOMP.EXE file from Disk 1 of your Microsoft Access disks to your
   Windows NT directory.

2. Insert Disk 4 in a floppy drive, type the following line, and then press
   ENTER:

   DECOMP <drive>:\VSHARE.38_ <drive>:\<directory>

   For example, to decompress the file from a disk in drive A to the NT\SYSTEM
   subdirectory on drive C, you would type the following line:

   DECOMP A:\VSHARE.38_ C:\NT\SYSTEM\VSHARE.386

The size of the VSHARE.386 file when expanded should be 14,933.
