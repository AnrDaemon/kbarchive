KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

There may be a 20 second delay in keystrokes and mouse movements when you are
running Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 with TCP/IP-32. This delay may be
repeated at intervals of 5 to 10 minutes.

This problem occurs when TCP/IP is NOT the default protocol, and the Enable
LMHOSTS Lookup check box is selected in Network Setup.

After your computer stops responding (hangs) for approximately 20 seconds, the
following message appears:

   DOS Error 53: The computer name specified in the network path cannot be
   located.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, make TCP/IP the default protocol.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in TCP/IP-32. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.
