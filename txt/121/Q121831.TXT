Do the following:

1. Run Creative Writer, and log in.

2. When you receive the error message, click Spike to continue.

3. Click the Letterizer Tool and make a note of the font that appears before the
   corrupt/unreadable font on the list.

4. Exit Creative Writer.

5. From the Apple Menu, choose Key Caps.

6. From the Key Caps menu, find the font that follows the font that you made a
   note of in step 3.

7. Remove that font from the System Folder:Fonts folder.

8. Open the MSKids:Users folder.

9. Locate your user folder inside the Users folder and open it.
