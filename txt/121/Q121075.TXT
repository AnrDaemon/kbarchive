TITLE   :DOCERR: Video for Windows Dev Kit ver. 1.1 & JPEG Compression
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1; :1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
 - Microsoft Video for Windows Development Kit, version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In the "Programmer's Guide" for Microsoft Video for Windows Development Kit,
version 1.1, a text search on "JPEG" and selection of the Custom Formats topic
displays the following incorrect information in table in the Custom Formats
section. The information in the table indicates that Video for Windows includes
a compressor supporting JPEG compression:

The following is a list of the compression types used by the compressors included
with Video for Windows.

   Registered by      Four-character code    Compression method
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
   Microsoft          MSVC                   Video 1
   Microsoft          MRLE                   Run-length encoding
   Texas Instruments  JPEG                   JPEG format for images
   Supermac           CVID                   Cinepak
   Intel              YUV9                   411 YUV format
   Intel              RT21                   Indeo 2.1 format
   Intel              IV31                   Indeo 3.0 format

This table is misleading. While it is true that Texas Instruments has registered
the FourCC for JPEG, no JPEG compressor is actually included with Video for
Windows runtimes or with the Microsoft Video for Windows Development Kit version
1.1.
