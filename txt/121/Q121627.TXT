 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

System performance, especially hard disk performance, decreases dramatically
after you install Windows 95.

CAUSE
=====

The NCR C810 PCI SCSI adapter functions correctly only if it is configured to
use IRQ 15. The BIOS setup utility on systems using Phoenix System BIOS version
5.12 or 5.33 allows the PCI SCSI adapter to be configured to use any IRQ in the
7-15 range. If the NCR C810 PCI SCSI adapter is not configured correctly,
Windows 95 is forced to use slower real-mode device drivers.

RESOLUTION
==========

Consult the system manual and change the NCR C810 PCI SCSI adapter IRQ setting
to IRQ 15 in the system BIOS setup utility. This enables Windows 95 to use the
faster protected-mode device drivers.
