When running Windows NT 3.5 setup on a 386 multiprocessor machine you
receive this a STOP message when rebooting from text setup to GUI setup:

   Stop 0x0000003E 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000
   MultiProcessor_Configuration_Not_Supported

This is issued because Windows NT 3.5 no longer supports 386 multiprocessor
machines. The only machine that was supported by Windows NT 3.1 and is
now not supported by Windows NT 3.5 is the Compaq Systempro Dual 386/25.
It has been removed from the Windows NT 3.5 Hardware Compatibility List.
