======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In File Manager, if you type a space on the To line of the Rename dialog box and
choose OK, Windows appears to delete the file. You cannot find the file by
searching for a space.

CAUSE
=====

The file has not actually been deleted. Windows has renamed the file to
"current" (without the quotation marks) in the directory that the file resided
in originally.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correctly rename the file:

1. In File Manager, select the file named "current."

2. From the File menu, choose Rename.

3. Type the new filename on the To line and choose OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups versions
3.10 and 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
