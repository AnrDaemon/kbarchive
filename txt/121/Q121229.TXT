KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you exit or shut down Windows 95, your computer stops responding (hangs).

CAUSE
=====

Norton Antivirus (NAVTSRW.EXE) from Norton Desktop for Windows 3.0 does not
restore INT 21 when it is terminated. This causes Windows 95 to hang when you
exit.

WORKAROUND
==========

At this time, the only workaround is to remove or remark out the NAVTSRW.EXE
line in the WIN.INI file.

In the [Windows] section of the WIN.INI file, change

   Load=NAVTSRW.EXE

   to:

   ;Load=NAVTSRW.EXE

   or to:

   Load=
