SYMPTOMS

When you install Windows NT version 3.5 over the network or from a CD-ROM drive
from MS-DOS using WINNT.EXE, the system stops responding (hangs) during the DOS
portion of the Setup process, and the following status message appears:

You may also experience a Setup failure during the generation of the Windows NT

following error message:

Z is recommended).
