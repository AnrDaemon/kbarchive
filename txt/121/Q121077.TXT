SUMMARY
=======

When you try to move a print job down in the queue of a Windows NT system from a
Windows for Workgroups system, this message is displayed on the WFWG system:

   This request is not supported by the network

MORE INFORMATION
================

The WFWG Print Manager allows various degrees of control over print jobs sent to
a shared printer. How much control you have over the print job depends upon
where you send it. When you print from a WFWG system to a locally attached
printer, you can cancel the job or move it up or down in the queue of pending
jobs.

When you print to a network printer, you cannot move jobs ahead in the queue.
This is by design: it prevents users from advancing their jobs at others'
expense. Users can still move jobs down in the queue.

When you print to a network printer shared by a Windows NT system, you cannot
move jobs up or down in the queue. All you can do is delete your own print jobs.
