PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95 appscomp kbAppCompatibility

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you double-click the Fonts icon in Control Panel, Adobe Type Manager (ATM)
PostScript Type 1 fonts are not displayed.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 displays only fonts that are listed in the registry or in the [FONTS]
section of the WIN.INI file. When ATM is installed, the fonts are not added to
this file. If you manually add the fonts to the WIN.INI file, they are
displayed, but they cannot be opened (or viewed).

RESOLUTION
==========

To view the installed ATM fonts, run the ATM Control Panel application
(ATMCNTRL.EXE) included with Adobe Type Manager.

MORE INFORMATION
