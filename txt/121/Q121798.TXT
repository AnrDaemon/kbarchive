TITLE   :PC Win: Err Msg: You Do Not Have the Proper Access...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error occurs when you log on to a Mail postoffice:

   You do not have the proper access to the post office. Please contact your
   system administrator.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur for a variety of reasons, most of which have to do with
network functionality and network access rights.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the postoffice is a new postoffice, make sure the rights on the postoffice
database are correct. Check the rights in two places: share permissions and file
permissions. Chapter 2 of the Mail 3.2 "Administrator's Guide" describes and
explains specific rights for LAN Manager and Novell network operating system
file and share rights.

If the postoffice is an existing postoffice, you should double check the rights.

To determine the reason for the error message
---------------------------------------------

1. Double check network rights on both shares and directories.

2. Check for locked open files--in particular, check the Mail message files
   (MMFs).

3. Try copying files to and from the client to the Mail database
   subdirectory/share on the postoffice. If a file copy works, there may be a
   problem with the individual MMF, or the MMF or other files may be locked
   open.

4. If the problem is with one client and the MMFs are on the server, try moving
   the MMF locally to see if this corrects the problem. If moving the MMF
   locally does correct the problem, check the rights for that user.

5. If the network operating system is Novell, check the postoffice database for
   ownerless files--specifically, check the MMF, KEY, and MBG subdirectories.
   Mail for Windows users must have RWCEM rights on these subdirectories;
   version 2.1 of Mail for Windows users need RWCEMF rights.
