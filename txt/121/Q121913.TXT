TITLE   :Err Msg: Error 59: An Unexpected Network Error Has Occurred
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER::3.11; WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the NET USE command to a server and share that does not exist, the
following error message may appear:

   Error 59: An Unexpected Network Error Has Occurred

In addition, attempting to connect to a nonexistent server and share using File
Manager causes the system to stop responding (hang). To quit Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11 and reboot the computer, press CTRL+ALT+DEL and press
ENTER when the blue screen appears.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the "DNS for Windows Name Resolution" option is enabled
and the IP address for a DNS server is not specified in the DNS Server search
list.

RESOLUTION
==========

If a DNS Server is not available, disable the "DNS for Windows Name Resolution"
option under Windows Networking Parameters in the Advanced Microsoft TCP/IP
Configuration dialog box. If a DNS Server is available, make sure that its IP
address is added to the DNS Server search list in the Microsoft TCP/IP -
Connectivity Configuration dialog box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you attempt to connect to a nonexistent network server and share using the
NET USE command, the expected error message is "Error 53: The computer name
specified in the network path cannot be located." If the same operation is
performed in File Manager, the same error message should appear in a STOP
message dialog box without "Error 53."
