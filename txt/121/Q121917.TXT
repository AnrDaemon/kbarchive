TITLE   :CONN: Stuck Handshake File When Postoffice on NTAS 3.1
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Mail Connection Gateway version 3.2 MACGATE directory is on an
Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server (NTAS) version 3.1 volume that is shared to
the Macintosh via Services For Macintosh (SFM), the "handshake" file used by the
Connection Gateway to verify that the opposite side of the gateway is still
operating can become "stuck" in the pctomac subdirectory. As a result, it is not
deleted by the Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks mail server running the
Macintosh component of the gateway. Mail will continue to flow from AppleTalk
Mail to Mail for PC Networks, but will not move from Mail for PC Networks to
AppleTalk Mail.

CAUSE
=====

The directory view presented to the Macintosh by SFM does not match the
directory view seen by MS-DOS or by Windows NT. The handshake file in the
pctomac directory is not visible to the Macintosh; thus, the Macintosh cannot
delete it. This causes the PC component to believe the Macintosh has stopped
running, so it will not put mail into the pctomac directory. It will continue to
process the mactopc directory; thus, the Macintosh component will continue to
move messages to the pctomac directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Upgrade the NTAS version 3.1 server to NTAS version 3.5. This version of NTAS
and the corresponding SFM do not display this behavior.
