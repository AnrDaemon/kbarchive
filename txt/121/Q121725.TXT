-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Performance Monitor is capable of correctly detecting conditions where the value
of a parameter falls below the specified limit. When this condition occurs an
alert can be generated and a batch file run. However, Performance Monitor will
not run the batch file correctly.

For example, if Performance Monitor is configured to send an alert and run a
batch file any time CPU utilization falls below 5%, the alert will be sent but
the batch file won't run.

CAUSE
=====

Performance Monitor allows parameters to be passed to the batch job. The "<"
parameter is being interpreted as a redirection from the STDIN port, confusing
the job.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Windows NT Server version 3.5. This problem was corrected in the latest U.S.
Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.5. For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
