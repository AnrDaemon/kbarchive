720-kilobyte (K) fulfillment disks.

RESOLUTION

StepUp disks. If you need this file, you must obtain it from another disk set
(5.25-inch 360K, 5.25-inch 1.2-megabyte [MB], or 3.5-inch 1.44 MB). For
information about obtaining a different disk set, call the Microsoft Sales
Information Center at (800) 426-9400.

STATUS

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS version 6.22. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
