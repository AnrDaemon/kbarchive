The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Space Simulator for MS-DOS, version 1.0

SYMPTOMS
========

The Z order of objects in Space Simulator may appear to be incorrect in some
instances. When viewed from above, an object that is positioned beneath another
object may be drawn as if it were above.

CAUSE
=====

Space Simulator treats all objects as spherical, with a diameter encompassing
the largest dimension of the object. For example, the Zander Freighter that has
a length of 1100 meters is treated by the program as if it were a sphere with a
diameter of 1100 meters. When Space Simulator is required to display two objects
very close to one another, the spherical boundaries of the objects may overlap.
Whichever edge of the spherical boundaries is closer to the view perspective
determines which object is drawn in the foreground, and which is drawn in the
background.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Position the Galactic Explorer so that the cockpit of the craft is between
   the rings of the Ring Station.

2. Switch to Chase view.

3. Position the Chase craft so that it is looking down on the Ring Station from
   above.

The Galactic Explorer is displayed as if it were above the Ring Station, rather
than between its rings. This occurs because the spherical scenery boundary of
the Galactic Explorer is closer to the Chase craft than the spherical scenery
boundary of the Ring Station. As a result, the program determines that the Ring
Station is below the Galactic Explorer when viewed from this angle.

This behavior is consistent throughout the program. Z order problems may be
visible when viewing any two objects that are positioned very close to one
another.
