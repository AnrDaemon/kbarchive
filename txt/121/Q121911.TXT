TITLE   :The Close Button Does Not Appear or Is Disabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95 appscomp kbAppCompatibility

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you start your application, the Close button (the button displaying an "x"
in the upper-right corner of the window) is either dim or does not appear at
all.

Applications known to exhibit this behavior include:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5 and 2.6


CAUSE
=====

Some applications draw their own caption and title bars. This prevents the
Windows 95 Close button from appearing or being enabled.

WORKAROUND
==========

Microsoft FoxPro for Windows
----------------------------

The Close button is dim in FoxPro for Windows because FoxPro deletes all the
items in the System menu. It then enters its own items into the System menu,
thus preventing Windows 95 from properly executing the Close button detection
code.

Currently, no workaround is available for this behavior.
