TITLE   :Problems with Snap To and Focus Enabled with IntelliPoint 1.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::1.0,3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win31

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
 - Microsoft IntelliPoint software, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Erratic behavior occurs in Windows or Windows for Workgroups when you enable
both the Snap-to option (with Return To Previous Position selected) and the
Focus option in Microsoft IntelliPoint Tools & Controls.

RESOLUTION
==========

To eliminate these problems, disable one of these options, or deselect the
Return To Previous Position option.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Examples of erratic behavior include the following:

 - If a window with a default button and any other window are open
   simultaneously, problems may occur when you try to switch between the two by
   moving the mouse pointer over the title bars. Specifically, after moving the
   pointer to the title bar of the second window and then to the title bar of
   the window with the default button, any subsequent attempts to return to the
   title bar of the second window result in the mouse pointer snapping to the
   default button on the first window.

 - In the previous scenario, if the second window (the window without the
   default button) is minimized, slightly different behavior results. After
   moving the pointer to the minimized window, any attempts to go to the title
   bar of the window with the default button result in the mouse pointer
   snapping to the minimized second window.

 - If two windows with default buttons are open simultaneously, similar problems
   may arise when attempting to switch between the two by moving the mouse
   pointer over the title bars. In this case, after moving between the title
   bars of the two windows once, any subsequent attempts to do so result in the
   mouse pointer continuously switching between the two windows.
