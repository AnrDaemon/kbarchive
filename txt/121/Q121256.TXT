KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the FLAG.GLB file size is zero and a remote client dials in to send mail, the
Microsoft Mail Multitasking Message Transfer Agent (MTA) generates the following
error message:

   Drive connection failure. Unable to prompt for a remote user login ID.

Although the Multitasking MTA generates an error, the MS-DOS version of the MTA
works correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

The FLAG.GLB file is normally 2 bytes in length and is used to prevent more than
one Mail administrator running the ADMIN.EXE program on the same postoffice at
one time.

Create a new FLAG.GLB file by copying one from another postoffice.

Additional query words: 3.20
