TITLE   :Scenes 2.0: Transition Effects Occur Only on New Image
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Scenes (all collections), version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The transition effects for Microsoft Scenes affect the new image only, not the
entire screen or the largest image.

CAUSE
=====

If the new image is smaller in size (for example, 640 x 200) than the current
image (for example, 640 x 400), only the area of the new image can be affected
by the transition effect. In this example, a small portion above and below the
new image would not be affected.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Scenes version 2.0. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
