SUMMARY
=======

When programs are run from a logon script, and they are located in the NETLOGON
share, the actual logon script can not determine what drive or path to execute
the program from, and the NETLOGON share is not included in the MS-DOS path
statement. To resolve this, Systems Management Server uses a little known
feature of MS-DOS to determine the drive and path the script is running from.

MORE INFORMATION
================

During a log on and when the logon script is running, the Lmscript.exe program
runs its commands from the NETLOGON share. However, batch files have no way of
determining where they are running from, and the current directory set by
Lmscript.exe is not the NETLOGON share. As a workaround, Systems Management
Server uses the %0\..\ path to indicate the argv[0] present when the batch file
was run. The batch file can then refer to this path and determine its own
location and look for other files there.

An example of this can be found in the Slow Network detection portion of the
Smsls.bat logon script file:

      REM SNET_DOS
      %0\..\netspeed
      if not errorlevel 1 goto NET_DOS
      if not errorlevel 2 goto END
      if errorlevel 2 %0\..\choice /T:Y,30 Slow network detected. Continue
      if not errorlevel 2 goto NET_DOS
      goto END

Prior to use of this technique, Systems Management Server was forced to use
hard-coded drive Z to reference needed files. Now the drive used during a NET
LOGON can be arbitrary, and dynamically determined.
