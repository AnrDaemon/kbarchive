TITLE   :FIX: Omitting Range Keyword After LABEL Directive Causes Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::5.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 5.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a LABEL directive is used without a type specifier, it will cause the
error:

   error A2003: Unknown type specifier

This error will correctly occur if the LABEL directive is the first statement in
the segment. However, if you also have executable statements prior to the LABEL
directive in the code segment, error messages, such as:

   error A2009: Symbol not defined: AX
   error A2006: Phase error between passes

will incorrectly occur on every statement.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 5.1. This problem
was corrected in MASM 5.1a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following program demonstrates the problem. The "mov ax, 1" statement will
incorrectly generate the error message:

   error A2009: Symbol not defined: AX

The statement "pt1 LABEL" will generate an:

   error A2003: Unknown type specifier

as expected.

Sample Code
-----------

   ; Assemble options needed: none

   .MODEL small
   .CODE
   main PROC
       mov ax, 1
       pt1 LABEL   ; This line is incorrect and should generate an error
   main ENDP
   END main
