TITLE   :FIX: Error Message A2051 Incorrectly Generated
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::5.1,5.1a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 5.1, 5.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The code given below generates the following error message:

   A2051: Operand not in current CS ASSUME segment

The error is caused by the JE NEAR PTR statement. However, the first jump
statement assembles without error. Both statements should or should not assemble
as they generate full 16-bit fixup records.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can work around this problem by not using the PTR operator in the JE
instruction.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM)
version 5.1 and 5.1a. This problem was corrected in MASM version 6.0.
