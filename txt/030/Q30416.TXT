TITLE   :FIX: Only First LOCAL Variable Generates CodeView Information
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::5.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 5.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 5.1, only the first LOCAL
variable on a line generates CodeView information. Attempting to put a watch on
a LOCAL variable that is not the first LOCAL variable on a line will cause
Codeview to display the following message box:

   

              --------------------------------
             |              ERROR             |
             |         Unknown Symbol         |
             |  Press Any Key to Continue...  |
              --------------------------------

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid the problem in MASM version 5.1, break up any lines that define more
than one LOCAL variable into multiple lines.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 5.1. This problem
was corrected in MASM version 5.1a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample code can be used to demonstrate the problem:

Sample Code
-----------

   ; Assemble options needed: /Zi
   ; Link options needed:     /CO

       .MODEL small, C    ; A Language specifier is required when using
                          ; the LOCAL directive in MASM 5.1, 5.1A and
                          ; when using QuickAssembler 2.01 and 2.51.
                          ; MASM 6.0 does not require this.

       .CODE

   Start:

       call  procedure    ; Call the procedure
       mov   ax, 4C00h    ; Exit
       int   21h

       procedure proc

       local     first:word
       local     second:word,third:word

       ; To avoid the problem in MASM 5.1, break the preceding line up
       ; into multiple lines:
       ;
       ; local      second:word
       ; local      third:word

       ret

       procedure endp

       .STACK
