The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 5.0, 5.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

There are two errors in the Pascal program on Page 64 of the Microsoft Macro
Assembler version 5.0 and 5.1 "Mixed-Language Programming Guide." The line
containing the following statement:

      procedure Pprog();

should be changed to read as follows (i.e., remove the parentheses):

      procedure Pprog;

In addition, the above line should be moved so that it is directly above the
following line:

      var a,b:integer;

If this line is not moved, the program will generate errors when it is compiled.

Additional query words: 5.0a 5.00 5.00a 5.1a 5.10 5.10a
