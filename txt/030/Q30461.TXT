SUMMARY
=======

The copy utility Nokey that comes with CopyIIPC may cause problems with
Microsoft Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Early versions of Nokey require Nokey to be memory resident when you run a
program that is not copy-protected. Later versions of Nokey perform a complete
conversion and do not require Nokey to be present in memory.

Any program that requires Nokey to be memory resident may not run in Windows and
should be run from MS-DOS instead. Contact Central Point Software to determine
if the version you are running needs Nokey in memory.

The products included here are manufactured by Central Point Software, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.
