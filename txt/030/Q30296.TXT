SUMMARY
=======

The following can cause a call to GlobalLock() to fail:

1. Attempting to Lock an invalid handle.

2. Attempting to Lock an object that has been discarded. (This will occur if the
   object was allocated as discardable and the system has discarded it due to
   low memory.)

3. When an application attempts to lock a DDE object that is in expanded memory
   under low memory conditions. (This act will cause GlobalLock() to fail if
   there is not enough memory below 1 megabyte to allow Windows to make a copy
   of the object that the application wishes to lock. If this problem occurs,
   the program should free some of its Global memory and then try the
   GlobalLock() again.)
