TITLE   :FIX: Command Line Option /Z Is Ignored after Processing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::5.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 5.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The /Z command line option tells the assembler to print out any offending lines
and any error messages it generates. The switch will work up to the first
include statement. When an include file is processed a flag is cleared by
mistake.

RESOLUTION
==========

The workaround for this problem is to bracket the include directive by the
.XLIST or .LIST directive. Do not include a .LIST directive in the include file.
This process will guarantee that the flag is set after the include file is
processed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM)
version 5.1. This problem was corrected in MASM version 5.1a.
