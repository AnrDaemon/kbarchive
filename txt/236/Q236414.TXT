SYMPTOMS
========

After you change the type of authentication to use only NTLM version 2, shares
may not be accessible on other computers.

CAUSE

Starting in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4), Microsoft provided an
enhancement to control the type of security used for authentication using
NTLMSSP. A new registry key named LMCompatibilityLevel was added. With the key
set to "Allow only NTLMv2", the local RDR does not succeed in getting
credentials.

Because of the increased security level, the NET USE command may not work when
the domain is defaulted. This is because the defaulted or non-existent domain is
rejected at this security level. For this command to work the domain name must
be supplied.
