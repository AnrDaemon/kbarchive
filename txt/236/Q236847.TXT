SUMMARY
=======

Configuring Host Security Domains can only be done using SNA Manager. Customers
that rely on SNA Server's command line utility (Snacfg.exe) are unable to set
configurations for Host Security Domains.

SNA Server's command-line interface has been enhanced so it is now possible to
create, delete, or modify Host Security Domains.

The Host Security Integration feature requires that information about Host
Security Domains is stored on the Host Security Database hosted on the Windows
NT primary domain controller. Creating a Host Security domain also creates two
user groups, one for the Users and one for Proxy. Therefore, this enhancement
can't really be used offline: the administrator must be logged on to the Windows
NT domain where the SNA subdomain configuration file will be used.

The syntax of this command is:

   SNACFG HSDOMAIN /LIST
   SNACFG HSDOMAIN hsdomainname
   SNACFG HSDOMAIN hsdomainname /PRINT
   SNACFG HSDOMAIN hsdomainname /ADD [options]
   SNACFG HSDOMAIN hsdomainname [options]
   SNACFG HSDOMAIN hsdomainname /DELETE

Available options are:

   /NAMES:{ MAP | REPLICATE }
   /PASSWORDS:{ MAP | REPLICATE }
   /OVERRIDE:{ Yes | No }
   /ENABLEUSER:<text>
   /DISABLEUSER:<text>
   /ENABLEPROXY:<text>
   /DISABLEPROXY:<text>
   /INSERTCONN:<text>
   /REMOVECONN:<text>

<Text> implies that a comma separated string is accepted.
/ENABLEUSER adds the named users to the group created for the host domain.
/DISABLEUSER removes the named user from the group created for the host domain.
/ENABLEPROXY adds the named users to the group created for the host domain
proxy.
/DISABLEUSER removes the named user from the group created for the host domain
proxy.
/INSERTCONN adds the named connections to the host domain. The connection must
already exist.
/REMOVECONN removes the named connection from the host domain.
