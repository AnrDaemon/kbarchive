======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT users or groups that have been assigned Read (View Only) rights to
the SNA Server Configuration file (Com.cfg) by SNA Server Manager may still be
able to perform the following functions:

 - Update and save changes to the SNA Server configuration.
 - Start and Stop SNA Server services.

NOTE: SNA Server Manager indicates that it is opened with "View Only" mode in the
lower right-hand corner of the Manager status line when it is opened by one of
these users.

These users can also use the SNA Server Command Line Configuration utility
(Snacfg.exe) to make changes to the SNA Server configuration.

Users and groups with Read (View Only) permissions are only supposed to be able
to view (or read) the SNA Server configuration using SNA Server Manager or
Snacfg.exe.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server Manager components do not correctly check security settings to
prevent users from getting Read/Write access to the SNA Server configuration
file.

This problem occurs when the Windows NT users or groups that have been assigned
Read (View Only) rights for SNA Server administration also have the "Manage
auditing and security log" user right assigned to them in Windows NT User
Manager for Domains.

==========
