-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Office 2000 Developer 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you close a project or the program that you started the Visual Basic Editor
from, you may receive the following message:

   Project <path\projectname >has been modified. Do you wish to save the
   changes now?

-or-

When you start the "Package and Deployment" Wizard, you receive the following
message:

   The active project must be saved before it can be packaged and deployed.

-or-

When you try to add a project to Visual SourceSafe, you receive the following
message:

   Please save your Project, '<projectname>', before using source code
   control.

You see one of these messages even though you have not made any changes since you
last saved the project.

CAUSE
=====

You see one of the messages listed in the "Symptoms" section if you have not
saved the project since you closed an Addin Class window, a Data Report window,
or a Data Environment window, or if you still have one of those windows open.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent the messages listed in the "Symptoms" section, close the Addin Class
window, the Data Report window, or the Data Environment window, and then save
your project. You can then close the project or program, add to Visual
SourceSafe, or run the "Package and Deployment" Wizard without seeing these
messages.
