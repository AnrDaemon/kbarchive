The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the SNA Manage Agent Service starts after the SNA Print Service, then some
printer sessions status may not be updated correctly in SNA Manager. This
generally happens on heavy loaded computers running Windows NT Server that have
a lot of services to start.

CAUSE
=====

Because of the high number of services that the Windows NT Server needs to
start, it may happen that the SNA Manage Agent Service is started after the SNA
Print Service. In such a case, some of the SNA Print Server threads to update
status information with SNA Manage Agent may not be initialized correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version
3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, and 4.0 SP2. This problem was
first corrected in SNA Server version 4.0 Service Pack 3.
