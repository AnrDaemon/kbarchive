SYMPTOMS
========

When you cast a spell in Microsoft Asheron's Call, a magical projectile may not
appear although the spell seems to work and your Mana is reduced by the
appropriate amount for that spell.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the spell materializes inside a solid object.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this issue from occurring, make sure an uninterrupted line of sight
exists between you and your target before you cast a spell.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Asheron's Call,
version 1.0 and Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty.
