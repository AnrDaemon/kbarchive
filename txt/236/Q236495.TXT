TITLE   :MOD2000: VSS Login Allows Access with a Blank UserName from VBE
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta modSSafe

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Office 2000 Developer 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

You are able to log on to Microsoft Visual SourceSafe by using a blank username
from a Visual Basic for Applications project in Microsoft Excel 2000 and
Microsoft Word 2000. After you log on, you are able to add, check out, and check
in projects. This behavior occurs even when the SourceSafe Administrator is
password protected.

CAUSE
=====

When you click "Add Project to SourceSafe" or Run SourceSafe in the Visual Basic
Editor, the OK button on the Visual SourceSafe Login dialog box is available if
the Username box does not contain any text.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this behavior, disable the "Use network name for automatic user log
in" feature of Visual SourceSafe. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Open Visual SourceSafe 6.0 Administrator.

2. On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the General tab.

3. Click to clear the "Use network name for automatic user log in" check box.

After you implement this workaround, you receive the following message if you
leave the Username box empty.

   User "" not found

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Behavior:

1. Open a new Excel workbook.

2. On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Visual Basic Editor.

3. On the File menu, click Save <projectname>, and in the Save As dialog
   box, click Save.

4. On the Add-ins menu, point to VBA Source Code Control, and then click Add
   Project to SourceSafe.

NOTE: If you do not get the choice for VBA Source Code Control on the Add-ins
menu, first click Add-in Manager on the Add-ins menu, select VBA Source Code
Control in the list, click to select the Loaded/Unloaded check box, and then
click OK.

5. Delete the name in the Username box, and then click OK. Note that nothing
   happens.
