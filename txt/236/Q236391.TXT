======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you restore the SNA Server configuration (Com.cfg file) that includes Host
Security Domains, the next time you go into the Host Account Manager (UDConfig),
you do not see any of the Host Security Domains that were originally configured.

CAUSE
=====

If SNA Server is removed and then reinstalled through the Setup process, some
registry parameters for the SnaDatabase and SnaPMP keys are also inadvertently
removed. These parameters are needed when using Host Security Integration.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 4.0, 4.0
SP1, and 4.0 SP2. This problem was first corrected in SNA Server version 4.0
Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following steps outline when this problem can be observed:

1. SNA Server is configured using Host Security Domains.

2. The configuration (Com.cfg file) is saved.

3. SNA Server is uninstalled, however, none of the Host Security Components are
   removed.

4. SNA Server is reinstalled and the Com.cfg file restored.

5. When you go into Host Account Manager (UDConfig), the Host Security Domains
   that were listed before the restore are gone.

When you view the application log of the Event Viewer, you see the following
event messages:

   Event 29:
   PMP attempt to read registry values failed.

   Event 531
