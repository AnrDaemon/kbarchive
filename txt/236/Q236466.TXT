STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition.

This problem was first corrected in Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6 and
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The checked version of a product is distributed with Microsoft Developer Network
(MSDN) products and to most vendors, as opposed to the retail version
distributed to most customers. The checked version contains more debugging
information in the code, which is helpful for tracking down problems to a
certain source file and number.

A checked service pack must be loaded onto a checked version of that operating
system. For example, you must load a checked version of SP5 onto a checked
version of Windows NT 4.0. You cannot load a checked version of SP5 onto a
retail version of Windows NT 4.0.
