======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When compiling code that uses templates and contains a mismatched number of
parameters between the declaration and implementation of the template classes,
the compiler may give the following error:

   fatal error C1001: INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR (compiler file '.\template.cpp',
   line 6514)

The line number is 6529 if you have installed Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3
(SP3).

CAUSE
=====

The compiler failed to correctly parse the code and was unable to generate a
syntax error message.

RESOLUTION
==========

Check the number of parameters in the declaration and implementation of the
template classes. Correct the code so that the parameters match.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++ .NET.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code demonstrates the bug:

   template <class T, bool bArray = false>
   class Test
   {
   public:
      Test(T *p);
      T* _p;
   };

   template <class T>                // Comment this line and uncomment 
                                     // the next line for fix.
   //template <class T, bool bArray>

   inline Test<T>::Test<T>(T *p)
   {
      _p = p;
   }

   void main()
   {
      Test<int, false> pInt = new int;
   }
