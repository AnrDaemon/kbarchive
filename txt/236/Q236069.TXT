KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbDesigner kbvfp600bug KbDBFDBC kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When displaying the properties of any field in the Selected Fields list of a
view, only the properties of the first listed field are available.

This worked properly in Visual FoxPro 5.0. However, Visual Studio 6.0 Service
Pack 3 does not fix this problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

Open the Properties dialog box and choose the desired field from the Field
drop-down list. This will cause the field properties to refresh correctly.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a local or remote view in Visual FoxPro 6.0. Use a table that has
   fields of differing data types.

2. With the View Designer open, modify the view by right-clicking on it and
   choosing Modify.

3. Highlight the first field in the Selected Fields list and press the
   Properties button on the View Designer.

4. In the View Field Properties window, note the name of the field displayed in
   the Field text box. Close the dialog.

5. Highlight any other field in the Selected Fields list and press the
   Properties button again.

In the View Field Properties window, observe that the name of the first field
still appears in the Field text box. The Field, Data Type, and Width text boxes
are not being updated.
