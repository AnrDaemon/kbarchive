TITLE   :Changes to the IWAM Account in IIS 5.0
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0, the default setup for a Web
application is to run as "out-of-process pooled" or medium application
protection. This means that if the application should stop for some reason, IIS
itself is not affected.

Because COM+ must run an out-of-process application with some identity, in the
case of IIS, IWAM_<MACHINE NAME>is used. In IIS 5.0, the IWAM_<MACHINE
NAME> account is a very low privilege account, just as in IIS 4.0. This was
done for security reasons. The side-effect of this is that some ISAPI
applications that require the process account to have localsystem-like
capabilities will fail. The most common are those that use reverttoself() to
perform some highly trusted function. The code following a call to
reverttoself() in an out-of-process application in IIS 5.0 (the default) may
fail.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Who is affected?

 - If your Web server does not use any custom ISAPI applications, you should not
   be affected.

 - Any code that worked correctly in an IIS 4.0 out-of-process application will
   also work in IIS 5.0.

 - If you use custom authentication ISAPI applications, you may be affected. The
   errors you may see are based on how the ISAPI application is written.

What should you do?

 - If you see no errors, then do nothing. IIS 5.0 is running in its optimal
   configuration.

 - If you do see an error and you feel the ISAPI application is the point of
   failure, then try the following:

   1. Run the application in-process. If that works, then contact your ISAPI
      application vendor to see if they have an update that runs out-of-process
      pooled.

   2. Run the application out-of-process and give the IWAM account "Act as part
      of operating system" and "Increase application quota" privileges. If this
      succeeds, then contact the ISAPI application vendor for an updated
      version.

 - If you are a developer writing ISAPIs or any functionality relying on
   localsystem after a reverttoself(), then you should start testing your code
   on the released version of Windows 2000 and IIS 5.0.
