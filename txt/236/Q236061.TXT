TITLE   :SMS: Zero Byte DDR Causes High CPU Usage by Discovery Data Mgr
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms120 kbsms120bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If Discovery Data Manager (DDM) attempts to process a Data Discovery Record
(DDR) that is zero bytes in size, the CPU usage by the Systems Management Server
Executive may increase significantly and never decrease. Further review
indicates that DDM is the cause for the increase. No new Drs will be processed.
To work around this problem, stop the Systems Management Server Executive
service, manually remove any zero byte DDRs and then restart the service.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack
Service Pack 1.
