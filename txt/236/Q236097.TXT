SYMPTOMS

specified method. At run time, calling the ReadMethod function returns only the
name of the method.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In Visual FoxPro, create a new project.

2. Change to the Code tab, highlight Programs and click the New button. Add the
   following code in the code window:

   DO FORM form1
   READ EVENTS

3. Save the new program file as main.prg.

4. Change to the Documents tab, highlight Forms and click the New button.

5. Add the following to the events in the form:

FORM.LOAD:

   WAIT WINDOW THIS.READMETHOD('CLICK')

FORM.CLICK:

   'THIS IS THE CODE IN THE CLICK OF THE FORM

FORM.UNLOAD:

   CLEAR EVENTS

6. Save the form as Form1 and close the designer.

7. On the Project Manager, click the Build button and build an executable file
   named Mytest.exe.

8. Change back to the Code tab in the Project Manager, highlight Main.prg, and
   click the Run button. Note that when the form is launched, a WAIT WINDOW
   appears with the text that was entered in the Click method of the form. Close
   the form with the close box.

Now, launch Windows Explorer and navigate to the directory that contains
Mytest.exe (built earlier in step 7). Double-click the executable. Note that a
WAIT WINDOW with only the method name 'Click' appears.
