-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An object other than a list item in a combobox traps mouse clicks on the
scrollbar of the drop-down list of a combobox.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior occurs under the following conditions:

1. The drop-down list of a combobox is opened by clicking on the combobox.

2. The mouse pointer is moved down the center of the drop-down list,
   highlighting the drop-down list items as the mouse pointer is moved.

3. The mouse is clicked more than one time, while the mouse pointer is
   positioned over the scroll bar of the combobox drop-down list and another
   control, such as a text box, command button, option group, check box, etc.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a program named "CBODROP.PRG" using the following code:

   Public cboForm
   cboForm=CreateObject("DemoForm")
   cboForm.Show()

   Define Class DemoForm as Form
      Caption   = "ComboBox Down Arrow Navigation"
      MinButton = .f.
      MaxButton = .f.
      Width     = 300
      height    = 200
      AutoCenter=.t.

      Add Object Combo1 as ComboBox with;
         RowSourcetype = 0, ;
         Style         = 2, ;
         Top           = 5, ;
         Left          = 5

      Add Object Command1 as CommandButton with;
         Caption = "Click Me", ;
         left    = thisform.Combo1.left+(thisform.Combo1.width/2), ;
         top     = 135, ;
         Height  = 25, ;
         Width   = 100

      Procedure init
         For i=1 to 10
            Thisform.Combo1.addlistitem(alltrim(str(i)))
         Endfor
      Endproc

      Procedure Command1.Click
         =MessageBox("Command Button Clicked.")
      Endproc

   Enddefine

2. From the Command window, type "DO CBODROP."

3. Click the combobox.

4. Drag the mouse pointer down the center of the combobox drop-down list.

5. Move the mouse pointer so that it is positioned over the combobox drop-down
   scrollbar and the command button.

6. Click the mouse three or more times.

7. Press the ESC key and observe that the MessageBox appears from the
   Command1.Click method.
