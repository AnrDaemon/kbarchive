SUMMARY
=======

You can grant network access to members of the Domain Admins group on a computer
running Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98, without explicitly adding
the Domain Admins group to share permissions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, members of the Domain Admins group have full access permissions to
all shared resources after you enable user-level security (either by using the
Network tool in Control Panel or by specifying a Setup script).

Remote administration is enabled automatically with access granted to the Domain
Admins groups on a Windows NT domain. On a Novell NetWare network, the
Supervisor account (for version 3.x) or the Admin account (for version 4.0) is
automatically granted access.

Granting remote administration privileges gives a user full access to all shared
resources on the system (including the ability to add and remove other remote
administrators). If you want to enable user-level security without automatically
enabling remote administration, you can use system policies to enable the
User-Level Access Control option.

To manually modify remote administration:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   Passwords.

2. On the Remote Administration tab, clear the "Enable Remote Administration of
   this server" check box.

3. Click Add, to add any appropriate administrators.
