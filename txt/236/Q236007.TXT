PRODUCT :Internet Information Server

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you demote a domain controller that is being used as an Internet
Information Services (IIS) 5.0 computer, all applications marked with
Application Protection: High (isolated) will fail. The following is an example
of an error message that may occur in the Event Viewer's application log:

   DCOM got error "Logon failure: the user has not been granted the requested
   logon type at this computer. " and was unable to logon .\IWAM_servername in
   order to run the server:
   {3D14228D-FBE1-11D0-995D-00C04FD919C1}

CAUSE
=====

The IWAM_servername is removed and recreated when the server's demotion occurs.
The passwords for the COM+ packages are no longer synchronized with the password
for the IWAM_server account.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, open a command prompt and go to the \Inetpub\Adminscripts
directory. Run the Synciwam.vbs script.

Example:

   cscript synciwam.vbs

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Services version 5.0.
