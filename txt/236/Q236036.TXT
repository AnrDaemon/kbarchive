SYMPTOMS
========

When using Network Discovery with Systems Management Server to locate system
resources on a network, those clients that have DHCP reservations are not
discovered.

CAUSE
=====

Network Discovery interrogates the DHCP server for information regarding devices
present on the network. The data requested does not include data corresponding
to DHCP reservations.

RESOLUTION

STATUS

version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 2.0. For information on obtaining the service
