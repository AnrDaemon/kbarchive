TITLE   :Problems with ATAPI Multiple-LUN Devices
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4, Atapi.sys recognizes ATAPI
multiple-LUN devices correctly (such as a CD-ROM/PD combination drive). However,
you may encounter the following problems with the device:

 - With a write-protected PD media, you may receive the following error message:

   The system was attempting to transfer file data from buffers to
   \Device\Harddisk(<x>)\Partition(<y>).
   The write operation failed, and only some of the data may have been written to
   the files.

 - If you replace one PD media with another and then press F5 to refresh the
   view in Windows NT Explorer, the media change is not detected and you
   continue to see the contents of the first media.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 version of the Atapi.sys file does not
correctly handle the Logical Unit Number (LUN).
