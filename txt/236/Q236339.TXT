======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view the lease duration for a DHCP scope, it may be set to 0 days, 0
hours, and 0 minutes.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur after a customized DHCP Option is removed from the DHCP
Scope. Note that this does not happen when you remove a custom Global Option.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, manually set the lease duration back to the
previous value. Note that the default lease duration is 3 days.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DHCP extensibility provides the ability to add custom DHCP options. This is done
within DHCP Manager by clicking Defaults on the DHCP Options menu. In the
Default Values window, the New button permits you to create the custom option.
For example, to create a custom option that assigns an FTP server with an option
number of 161, type the following information in the following fields:

Name: FTP Option
Data Type: IP Address
Identifier: 161
Comment: FTP Server

After this is done, the custom scope option can now be added to global or scope
properties.
