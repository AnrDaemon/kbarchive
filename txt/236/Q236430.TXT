NOTE: On some proxy servers, such as Microsoft Proxy Server, you need to open UDP
port 0 as an additional Subsequent UDP Inbound port.

Ports defined as "Inbound" are those originating from the Asheron's Call server
and going to the client through the firewall or proxy server. Ports defined as
"Outbound" are those originating from the client and going to the Asheron's Call
server through the firewall or proxy server.

Depending on your network configuration, you may also need change the default
network port setting in Asheron's Call. These are available by following these
steps:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Games, point to Asheron's
   Call, and then click Asheron's Call.
