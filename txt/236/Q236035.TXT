SUMMARY
=======

Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 1 Installer (version 2.00.80 or
above) now has two options when using the Call DLL script item:

 - Call function written specifically for SMS Installer: Use this option to call
   a function that is written specifically for SMS Installer. Provide the
   variables, the parameter string, and the action.

 - Call function with variable parameter list: Use this option to call a
   function that has variable parameters and that is not known to SMS Installer.
   If you choose this option, you must provide the variable parameter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ability to call a function written specifically for Systems Management
Server Installer has been available in previous versions. Samples of custom DLLs
and scripts that call them are available in the \DLL and \Samples directories of
your SMS Installer installation directory.

The ability to call a function with a variable parameter list is new to SMS
Installer 2.0.80.00 and later, which is provided with Systems Management Server
2.0 Service Pack 1.

STATUS

version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
