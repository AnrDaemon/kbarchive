TITLE   :XFOR: To Field Empty if User Sends Mail w/AT Command from OV/VM
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When an OV/VM user sends a message with the AT or CT command in the message body
to an Exchange Server recipient by means of the Microsoft PROFS Connector, the
message has an empty To field if the AT command is used and an empty Cc field if
the CT command is used.

CAUSE
=====

The display name used with the AT and CT commands does not have a valid PROFS
address; this causes the Microsoft PROFS Connector to discard the display name.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Microsoft PROFS Connector

+---------------------------+
| File name    | Version    | 
+---------------------------+
| Lsvmhc.dll   | 5.5.2630.0 | 
+---------------------------+
| Lsdiamex.exe | 5.5.2630.0 | 
+---------------------------+
| Lsvmdia.exe  | 5.5.2630.0 | 
+---------------------------+
| Lsdiavm.exe  | 5.5.2630.0 | 
+---------------------------+
| Xfmload.exe  | 5.5.2630.0 | 
+---------------------------+

And add the following entry in the [LME-PROFS] section of the Exchconn.ini file:

PROFS_DummyAddr = Node(Addr)

The Node and Addr need to comply the PROFS address format, that is no more than
eight characters.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.
