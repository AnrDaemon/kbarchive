======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Visual Basic project using the Data control or otherwise has a Reference to
the Microsoft DAO Object Library, is compiled into an executable file. The
Package and Deployment Wizard is used to create a deployment package. When this
package is run on another computer, the following error message appears:

   An error occurred while registering the file expsrv.dll.

CAUSE
=====

Your setup package contains Expsrv.dll version 6.0.0.8268 or earlier.

The setup package is attempting to register Expsrv.dll. Version 6.0.0.8268 is not
a self-registering file. However, it includes the resource tag OLESelfRegister,
which indicates that it is a self-registering file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was first corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. However, we
recommend that you install the latest Visual Studio service pack and create a
new deployment package.
