OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:sna4 kbsna400sp1 kbsna400sp2

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Currently, the OLE DB provider for DB2 does not support ODBC connections to VSE
mainframe environments. Also, support is not available for SQL/DS - DB2/VM. An
excerpt from the Readme file (located on the SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 2 CD)
states:

   9.5.5 DB2 for VM and VSE
   -------------------------

   OLE DB Provider for DB2 and ODBC Driver for DB2 have not been tested with
   SQL/DS - DB2/VM or DB2/VSE. These platforms are not supported with this
   release of the OLE DB Provider and ODBC Driver.

   For more information on Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2 limitations, please
   see the section about programming considerations using OLE DB Provider for
   DB2 in the SNA Server SDK online documentation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although OLE DB does not currently support VSE environments, the StarSQL driver
included with SNA Server 4.0 and SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 1 does support the
VSE version 3.3 or later. An excerpt from the Odbcreadme.txt file (located on
the SNA server 4.0 Service Pack 1 CD) states:

   HOST DATABASES
   --------------

   StarSQL can connect to any of the following host databases:

 - DB2 MVS (DB2 for OS/390) 2.3 and later
 - SQL/DS (DB2 for VM and VSE) v3.3 and later
 - DB2/400 (OS/400 v2r2 and later)
 - DB2 Common Server (Universal Database) for UNIX, OS/2, and Windows NT 2.1 and
   later

Also, after you install the StarSQL driver with SNA server 4.0 or 4.0 Service
Pack 1, updating to Service Pack 2 or later service packs does not remove the
installed StarSQL driver. Therefore, it is still possible to continue to apply
service packs to SNA Server 4.0 and maintain the latest service level.
