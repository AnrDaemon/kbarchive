TITLE   :Event ID 3: IISLOG Unable to Create File
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Internet Information Server (IIS) generates the following event log message
intermittently in Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 3 Source : IISLOG Description: IIS Logging was unable to create the
   file C:\WINNT\System32\LogFiles\W3SVC1\ex990628.log. The data is the error.

NOTE: The data in the event message is 5, Access Denied. The file noted in the
event message is being created and the log entries are written.

CAUSE
=====

IIS attempted to flush its log cache using the credentials of a user who does
not have write access to the log file location.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, see the following Knowledge Base article for hotfix
information:

   Q275032 IISLog Event Can't Create Directory Occurs at Startup

WORKAROUND
==========

In order to avoid receiving the errors in the event log, you must give the
special group Everyone either Change or Full Control permissions to the log file
folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

IIS flushes its log cache periodically and when it does, it uses the security
context of the currently running thread. If that fails, IIS will generate the
event log shown above, and then attempt to write the log using the System
account.
