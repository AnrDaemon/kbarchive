The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual InterDev, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After adding a Visual InterDev project to Source Control you cannot see the
project in the Visual SourceSafe explorer.

CAUSE
=====

This can happen if the Visual InterDev project is added to a different Visual
SourceSafe database than expected. This sometimes happens when Visual SourceSafe
is installed during the Visual Studio setup, which provides two distinct setup
opportunities. The option to install Visual SourceSafe occurs both in the Client
and Server portions of the installation of Visual Studio 6.0. The two
installations are slightly different, and install to different paths.

The Visual SourceSafe installation in the server portion of Visual Studio setup
installs Visual SourceSafe Server into \Program Files\Microsoft Visual
Studio\VSS. This version contains tools for setting up Source Control on remote
computers that utilize a centralized Visual SourceSafe database.

The Visual SourceSafe installation from the client portion of Visual Studio setup
installs to \Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\VSS. This version of
Visual SourceSafe is intended for developers to use locally on their computers,
and does not have the support to set up remote computers to utilize this Visual
SourceSafe database, specifically Netsetup.exe support.

When Visual InterDev is used to put a Web project under Source Control, it makes
requests to the FrontPage Server Extensions (FPSE) to check files in to and out
of Source Control on the users' behalf. The FrontPage Server Extensions attempt
to locate a Visual SourceSafe database they can use by searching the registry
for the location of Ssapi.dll. Since both installations of Visual SourceSafe
install and register this DLL, the setup program that was run last is the DLL
that is found. The server extensions then move up one folder and read the
contents of the Srcsafe.ini file for detailed information on implementing Visual
SourceSafe. Note that this activity occurs on the Web server, and not the client
where Visual InterDev is installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Look in the two paths cited above, or search the hard disk drive for multiple
versions of the Ssapi.dll. Uninstall multiple copies of Visual SourceSafe, and
reinstall the version that you want to use. The Server version of Visual
SourceSafe can be uninstalled from the Add/Remove control panel. The Client
version of Visual SourceSafe can be uninstalled by running the Visual Studio
Setup program. Choose Workstation Tools and Components, and then cancel the
Visual SourceSafe selection in the Add/Remove section.

If you require multiple Visual SourceSafe databases on the Web server and the
FPSE do not find the database you want, you can either reinstall the version of
Visual SourceSafe you want the FPSE to use, or you can manually register
\VSS\Win32\SSAPI.dll for the appropriate installation of Visual SourceSafe for
the FPSE to use.

To register the DLL manually, click Start, Run, and type:

" regsvr32 <full path to dll>\ssapi.dll " (without the quotation marks)

You should receive a success dialog box if the DLL is registered correctly.

Ensure that the Visual SourceSafe Administrator tool adds user accounts to the
correct Visual SourceSafe database by clicking Users/Open SourceSafe Database
and checking the path. Add user accounts to the appropriate Visual SourceSafe
database for each developer's user name that will be working against the project
in Visual InterDev. The password field is ignored and may be left blank.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use Change Connection in Visual InterDev, the FrontPage Server
extensions use the currently registered Ssapi.dll file, and add the Visual
InterDev project to the correct Visual SourceSafe database.

If the Visual SourceSafe project in the wrong database has file histories that
you want to preserve, you can use the Archive and Restore utilities in Visual
SourceSafe to copy the project from one database to another. You should do this
before following the steps in the Resolution section above, and restore the
project as the one that you are using in step 4.
