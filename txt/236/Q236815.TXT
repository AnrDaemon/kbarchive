SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how the ControlSource property of the grid column and the
ControlSource property of the column's CurrentControl affect the display and
manipulation of data.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The display value for a grid's column is determined as follows:

 - If CurrentControl.ControlSource, Column.ControlSource, and Grid.RecordSource
   are not specified, the grid displays the fields from the table that is open
   in the current work area. If a table is not open, nothing is displayed.

 - If the column and the ControlSource of its CurrentControl is not specified,
   the display value is based on the respective fields in the table. (The fields
   are pulled from a table as described in the first above scenario.) For the
   first column, the default is the first field in the table. For the second
   column, it is the second field, and so on.

 - With the second above scenario, if a column already has an explicit
   ControlSource, the respective table field is assigned to the next column that
   does not have a ControlSource specified.

 - If the Column.ControlSource and the CurrentControl.ControlSource properties
   are different and the Bound property of the column is set to .F., the
   following behaviors occur based on the setting of the Sparse property of the
   column:

    - If Sparse = .F., the column always displays the value in the field that is
      specified as the ControlSource of the CurrentControl.

    - If Sparse = .T., the column displays the ControlSource of the column when
      the column does not have the focus. When the column has focus, the
      ControlSource of the CurrentControl is displayed.

The data is updated based on the settings of ControlSource and Bound properties
as follows:

 - If the Bound property of the grid's column is set to .T., the ControlSource
   of the column overrides the ControlSource of the column's CurrentControl.
   Therefore, data changes in the column are written to the table/field
   specified as the column's ControlSource.

 - If the Bound property of the column is set to .F., the ControlSource of the
   CurrentControl is in effect and updates are written to the field/table that
   is specified as the ControlSource of the CurrentControl.
