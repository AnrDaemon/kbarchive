======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If there are more than 11 network adapters configured in Windows NT, with the
DLC protocol bound to them, the Adapter dropdown list in the 802.2 DLC Link
Service properties within SNA Manager is blank.

CAUSE
=====

The 802.2 DLC link configuration uses a small buffer size to hold the list of
adapter names. The drop-down list is being incorrectly blanked out because there
are too many adapter names to fit in the buffer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

In the Control Panel, double-click Network, click the Bindings tab, and unbind
the DLC protocol from some of the network adapters until there are 11 or fewer
bound with DLC. The remaining network adapters that do have DLC bound to them
now appear in the Adapter dropdown list in the 802.2 Link Service properties.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server versions
3.0, 3.0Sp1, 3.0SP2, 3.0SP3, 3.0SP4, 4.0, 4.0SP1, and 4.0SP2. This problem was
first corrected in SNA Server version 4.0 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The buffer size has been increased from 256 to 4096 to prevent this problem from
occurring.
