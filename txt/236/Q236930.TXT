TITLE   :Cannot Open Files if Restrictions in a Policy Are Used
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbui win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using system policies and you enable restrictions in a policy for a
Windows 95-based computer, you may receive the following error message when you
try to open a document that is associated with a program that you specified in
the policy as a program that should be permitted to run:

   This operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this
   computer. Please contact your system administrator.

For example, this problem may occur if you double-click a Microsoft Project file,
when Microsoft Project (Winproj.exe) is on the list of permitted programs.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the registry information associating the file type
with the permitted program is incorrect. For example, this problem can occur if
the path to the permitted program contains spaces, and the path is not enclosed
with quotation mark characters when stored in the registry. If the path in the
registry contains spaces and is not surrounded by quotation marks, Windows 95
does not resolve the path to the program correctly when determining if the
program is on the list of permitted programs.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Microsoft Windows 98.

To work around this problem, edit the path to the program associated with the
file type you want to open:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Windows Explorer. Use Windows
   Explorer to view the folder containing the file you want to work with,
   right-click this file, click Properties, and then note the file type. For
   example, a Microsoft Project for Windows 95 file would have a "Microsoft
   Project 4.1 Project" file type.

2. In Windows Explorer, click Options on the View menu, and then click the File
   Type tab.

3. In the list of registered file types, locate the entry for the file type you
   noted in step 1, click this entry, and then click Edit.

4. Under Actions, click Open, and then click Edit.

5. In the "Application used to perform action" box, add quotation mark
   characters around the path to the program file. For example, if the
   "Application used to perform action" box contains the following text

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\WINPROJ\winproj.exe "%1"

   you would change this text to:

   "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\WINPROJ\winproj.exe" "%1"

6. Click OK, click OK, click OK, and then quit Windows Explorer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 95.

This problem was corrected in Windows 98. This problem is also corrected in
Windows 95 with Internet Explorer 4.01 Service Pack 1 or later installed, and
with Active Desktop enabled..

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem is known to occur with the following Microsoft programs:

 - Microsoft Access 97, Spanish language version

 - Microsoft Project 95, Spanish language version

When these programs are installed, the path to the installed program is not
enclosed in quotation mark characters when the path is entered into the
registry.
