TITLE   :XIMS: URL Not Formatted Properly in IMAP Referral Response
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you connect to Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 143 on an Internet
Mail Access Protocol (IMAP) server, and then attempt to log on to a different
server, the logon request may be authenticated by the second server instead of
the first. You may be logged on successfully, but in the response you receive,
the trailing slash mark (/) is missing from the second server's uniform resource
locator (URL). For example, the response may appear similar to the following:

   OK [REFERRAL imap://<server>;AUTH=*<domain>] LOGIN completed

This URL is not compatible with Request for Comments (RFC) 2192, which indicates
that the URL in an IMAP referral should be in the following format:

   imap://<server>/

RESOLUTION
==========

version 5.5. For additional information, click the following article number to
