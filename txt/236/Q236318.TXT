KEYWORDS:kbServer kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 1, the Server Connection account
is created in the same domain where the Site Server resides. This account has
the name SMSServer_<site code> and is used to connect from Remote Site
Systems to the Site Server.

In Systems Management Server 2.0 (the final released version), this account was
created in the same domain where the Service Account was created for the Site.

If a Systems Management Server 2.0 (the final released version) Site is upgraded
to Service Pack 1, the Server Connection account location is unchanged and will
remain in the same domain where the Service Account was created for the Site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In a Master Domain Model where the Systems Management Server 2.0 Site Server
resides in a Resource Domain and the Service Account is created in the Master
Accounts Domain, the following behavior is observed in the following scenarios:

A New Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 1 Installation Is Performed
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Server connection account will be created in the same domain as the Site
Server. In this example, the account will be created in the Resource Domain.

An Upgrade Is Performed on a Current Systems Management Server 2.0 (the final released version) Site
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Server connection account will remain in the same domain as the Service
Account. In this example, the account will remain in the Master Accounts
Domain.

There will be no changes to the location of the Server connection account between
versions of Systems Management Server 2.0 when in a single domain model.
