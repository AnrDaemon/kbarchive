TITLE   :Write Protect Error Occurs After Program Is Run from Floppy Disk
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a program from a write-protected floppy disk and then quit the
program, you may receive the following error message:

   System - Write Protect Error

   The disk cannot be written to because it is write protected.
   Please remove the write protection from the volume in drive A:.

If the floppy disk is not write-protected, the error message does not occur.

CAUSE
=====

When a program is run from a floppy disk, Windows handles the program file like
a modified page. After the program is quit, the modified page should be removed
without file input/output (I/O). The problem occurs because Windows attempts to
write the page to the floppy disk like a modified data page.
