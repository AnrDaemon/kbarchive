-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In a 16-Bit Windows process on Windows 98 application, the listening socket is
registered for asynchronous notifications using the WSAAsyncSelect() function,
see the following code sample:

   WSAAsyncSelect(hListenSocket, hWind, WM_SOCKET, 
                  FD_ACCEPT | FD_WRITE | FD_READ | FD_CLOSE).

The listening socket receives the FD_ACCEPT notification and accepts the
connection using the accept() function. The socket returned by the accept()
function does not receive the FD_WRITE, FD_READ or the FD_CLOSE notifications.
These properties of the listening socket are not transferred to the accepted
socket. Therefore, the listening socket will not receive any further
notifications.

RESOLUTION
==========

You will need to call WSAAsyncSelect again on the accepted socket with the
required notification.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Accepted sockets don't inherit notifications registered for the listening socket
in a 16-bit applications on Windows 95 computers that have the Winsock2 upgrade
installed.
