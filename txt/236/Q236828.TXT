======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server, versions 7.0, 7.01 
 - Microsoft OLE DB, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft SQL Server OLE DB provider (SQLOLEDB), the following
error is returned from IRowsetChange::DeleteRows():

   HRESULT = E_UNEXPECTED Description = "Catastrophic error"

CAUSE
=====

A pointer to an ISequentialStream interface has been retrieved on the row and
has not been released.

RESOLUTION
==========

Release all ISequentialStream pointers on the row before deleting the row with
IRowsetChange::DeleteRows.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce this Behavior
--------------------------------

1. Create a table in SQL Server with an image field.

2. Use the Active Template Library (ATL) OLE DB Consumer Wizard to create a
   CCommand class that will be used to open up a rowset on the table. The wizard
   will generate code similar to the following in the accessor class:

   	BLOB_ENTRY(2, IID_ISequentialStream, STGM_READ, m_field2)

3. Using the new CCommand derived class, add the following:

      HRESULT hr;
      CMyCommand rs;
      rs.Open();
      rs.MoveNext();<BR/>
   // rs.m_field2->Release(); //un-comment this line to fix the error 
      hr = rs.Delete();

   You will notice that E_UNEXPECTED is returned from the Delete() call.
