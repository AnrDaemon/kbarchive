TITLE   :XFOR: Adding Exchange Address Book to Lotus Notes Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you successfully install the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes,
you may find that the Address Book file, Exchange.nsf (the default name of the
target address book), does not appear when you address messages in the Lotus
Notes client.

CAUSE
=====

The Lotus Notes server's Notes.ini file does not contain a pointer to the
Exchange.nsf database.

RESOLUTION
==========

Edit the Lotus Notes server's Notes.ini file. Change the line that reads

   NAMES=names.nsf

to

   NAMES=names.nsf,exchange.nsf

After you make the change and restart the Notes server, Lotus Notes client users
have the option of selecting names from the Exchange Server Address Book as well
as the Lotus Notes Name and Address Book.
