PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kberrmsg kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On your computer running Windows NT, the Spooler service may stop responding
(hang) and one or more of the following error messages may be appear in the
Event Viewer System log:

   Spoolss.exe. Initialization of the dynamic link library failed.

   %SystemRoot%\System32\Hpbcom.dll failed - the process is terminating
   abnormally.

CAUSE
=====

These error messages may indicate that your computer is attempting to use an
incorrect third-party printer driver. The Hpbcom.dll file is part of the Hewlett
Packard (HP) JetAdmin software for Windows 95 or Windows 98. This software is
not supported on Windows NT Server or Windows NT Workstation even though you can
successfully install this software on Windows NT.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, remove the JetAdmin software:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   Add/Remove Programs.

2. Click to select the JetAdmin software from the list of installed software,
   and then click Add/Remove.

3. Click Yes, click Yes when prompted to remove the shared files that are no
   longer in use, and then click Yes to restart the computer.


NOTE: JetDirect is no longer supported by HP. SDI (Simple Device Installation) is
now used to install network printers. For more information on this, see:
