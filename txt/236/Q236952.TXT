TITLE   :PRB: Sort Order Has Changed with Microsoft Jet Version 4.0

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for Access, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Jet, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Access 2000 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using Microsoft Jet version 4.0, sorting is different than in previous versions.
For example, assume you have the following records in an Access table:

+--------+
| FIELD1 | 
+--------+
| W      | 
+--------+
| W-     | 
+--------+
| WB     | 
+--------+
| W-B    | 
+--------+

In previous versions of the Jet database engine, issuing "SELECT * FROM TABLE1
ORDER BY field1" gives the following results:

+--------+
| FIELD1 | 
+--------+
| W      | 
+--------+
| W-     | 
+--------+
| W-B    | 
+--------+
| WB     | 
+--------+

With Jet version 4.0, you now get the following results:

+--------+
| FIELD1 | 
+--------+
| W      | 
+--------+
| W-     | 
+--------+
| WB     | 
+--------+
| W-B    | 
+--------+

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Jet version 4.0 uses a new sorting order that treats hyphens (-) and
single quotation marks (') as special characters. For example, Co-op and Coop
are now considered equal when sorting. Also O'Connor is treated the same as
OConnor.

RESOLUTION
==========

This behavior is by design. You cannot change any settings to affect this
behavior.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SQL Server full-text queries and Index server have similar behavior when
searching.
