TITLE   :Files and Folders Reappear After Deletion with Roaming Profiles

The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

After you delete files or folders of a user's roaming profile, the files and
folders reappear.

CAUSE
=====

If a user has a roaming profile and logs on to different computers (locally
cached profiles enabled), they may experience the following behavior:

After deleting files or folders on their profile and logging off from computer A,
the files or folders reappear if they log on to computer B, where they have
logged on before.

This problem occurs because the locally-cached profile on computer B still has
the files and directories in the locally-cached profile. When downloading the
roaming profile from the profile server, the user has a local profile with the
former deleted files and folders again. After logging off from this computer,
the complete profile is copied back and the former deletion of files and folders
seemed to have no effect.

WORKAROUND

To work around this problem, disable the locally-cached profiles. To do this,
please see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

   Q173870 How to Automatically Delete Locally Cached Profiles


STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
