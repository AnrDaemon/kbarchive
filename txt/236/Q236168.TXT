TITLE   :XADM: Administrator Able to Change Mailbox Permissions
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

An Exchange Server administrator with the Admin. role can edit and change
mailbox permissions on the Permissions tab when the mailbox is initially
created. If the same administrator attempts to modify or change the same
attributes on an existing mailbox at a later time, he or she receives an error
stating that he or she has insufficient access rights.

While creating the mailbox, the assignment of permissions and other operations
are treated as a single task. Because users with the Admin. role can create
mailboxes, they can assign permissions while creating mailboxes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by design.
