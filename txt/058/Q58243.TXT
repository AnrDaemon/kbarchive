TITLE   :Cannot Run Real Mode Under Enhanced with SHARE
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0a

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run SHARE, run Microsoft Windows 3.0 in 386 enhanced mode, start an
MS-DOS prompt, and run real mode Windows 3.0 in the virtual machine, you receive
the following error:

   Sharing Violation error reading drive C:

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. With SHARE running, the different virtual machines
running act just like different network workstations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem is exactly the same problem as two workstations on a network trying
to run the same installed version of Windows from a network server. You must set
things up properly for this to work. All of the files that Windows opens (*.INI,
*.DLL, *.EXE, *.DRV) must be marked read-only with the MS-DOS ATTRIB command or
you will get sharing violations. The ATTRIB syntax for read-only is as follows:

      ATTRIB <filename> +r

Additional query words: 3.00 3.00a
