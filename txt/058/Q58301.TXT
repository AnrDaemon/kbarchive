SUMMARY
=======

The following setting is required in the [386Enh] section of the Microsoft
Windows SYSTEM.INI file for proper 386 enhanced mode operation on the Epson 386
Portable:

   EMMEXCLUDE=E000-EFFF

This requirement is due to nonstandard ROM mapping by the Epson 386 Portable.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The reason this is needed is because the Epson 386 Portables have ROM at these
segment addresses that do not have proper ROM signatures. Enhanced mode normally
automatically excludes regions of the machine address space that is occupied by
ROM, but this requires that the ROM be correctly marked as ROM. Unfortunately,
Epson copied IBM's design for the PS/2 machines (PS/2s also have improperly
marked ROM at E000-EFFF). This region is properly excluded on PS/2 MCA machines
through MCA specific code, but not on the Epson machines because Epson machines
are ISA machines.
