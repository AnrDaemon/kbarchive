[DEVICES] SECTION
-----------------

The [devices] section names the active printers. The settings in this
section reflect those in the [PrinterPorts] section, without the
timeout values. This section is necessary for Windows Versions 2.x
applications, which look for the [devices] section for this
information.

The [devices] section can contain settings of the following type:

<device-name>=<driver-name, port-name>

Purpose: The <device-name> keyname is the name of the device. The
         <driver-name> value is the driver filename. If a device is
         not currently connected, the <port-name> value should be the
         string specified in the NullPort settings (in the [windows]
         section).

To change: Choose the Printers icon from the Control Panel window.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.0 3.0a 3.00a win30
