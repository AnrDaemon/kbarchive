The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 2.03, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have used all the standard procedures for installation and Microsoft
Windows stops responding (hangs) or performs inconsistently, check the size
of .COM and .EXE files to see if the size is within normal limits. Some
computer viruses can increase the size of .COM and .EXE files. If Windows
does not run properly after setting it up with the correct options, check
these file sizes to determine if a virus has infected the system.
