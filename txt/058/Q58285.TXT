The Microsoft Windows 3.0 8514 driver color table is attuned to the
256-color mode, which requires the IBM 8514 Memory Expansion Kit (to a
total of 1 MB). The colors used may not be as pleasing to the eye when
used on the adapter without the Memory Expansion Kit because it yields a
16-color mode rather than a 256-color mode.

Microsoft is aware of this limitation in the 8514 driver. We are
researching this feature and will post new information here as it
becomes available.

Please note that the Windows 2.x driver for the 8514 adapter requires the
Memory Expansion Kit and will not work without it installed.

Additional query words: 3.0 3.0a 3.00 win30
