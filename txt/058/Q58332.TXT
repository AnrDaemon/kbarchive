[DESKTOP] SECTION
-----------------

The [desktop] section contains optional settings that control the
appearance of the screen background (desktop) and the positioning of
windows and icons on the screen.

The [desktop] section can contain the following settings:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
GridGranularity=<integer>
Default:   0
Purpose:   Specifies the incremental size (in logical units) of the
           grid that Windows uses to position icons and windows on the
           screen. The allowed range is 0 through 49. The grid changes
           in multiples of eight pixels.
To change: Choose the Desktop icon from the Control Panel window.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Pattern=<b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 b7 b8>
Default:   None
Purpose:   Specifies a pattern that is used as a brush to paint the
           screen background. The eight numeric values define a bitmap
           eight pixels wide and eight pixels high. Each decimal value
           represents a byte, and each byte represents eight pixels.
           The following shows the effect of setting a bit:

           Setting   Effect
           -------   ------

           0         Sets the corresponding pixel to the background
                     color.

           1         Sets the corresponding pixel to the foreground
                     color.

To change: Choose the Desktop icon from the Control Panel window.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
TileWallpaper=<0-or-1>
Default:   0
Purpose:   If set to 0, the desktop wallpaper is centered on the
           screen. If set to 1, the wallpaper is tiled across the
           screen.
To change: Choose the Desktop icon from the Control Panel window.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Wallpaper=<bitmap-filename>
Default:   None
Purpose:   Supplies the name of a bitmap file in the Windows
           directory. This bitmap appears on the screen background.
To change: Choose the Desktop icon from the Control Panel window.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
WallpaperOriginX=<x-coordinate>
Default:   0
Purpose:   Adjusts the initial offset of a tiled wallpaper.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Default:   0
Purpose:   Adjusts the initial offset of a tiled wallpaper.
