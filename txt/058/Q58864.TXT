SUMMARY
=======

The following macro can be used to determine the segment from which the macro is
called during assembly of a source file.

In the following example, the "findseg" macro is called from within two
individual segments named code1 and code2, respectively. The macro then uses IF
statements to determine the segment. Then, depending upon the segment, any
desired code can be assembled.

           findseg macro segname
             ifidn <code1>, <segname> ; if in segment code1
                     :                ; do what is desired
             endif

             ifidn <code2>, <segname> ; if in segment code2
                     :                ; do what is desired
             endif
             endm                     ; end macro

             findseg code1   ;macro call in segment code1
                        .
                        .
                        .
             findseg code2   ;macro call in segment code2

Note that invoking the findseg macro with the @curseg equate as a macro argument
will not yield a true condition for the ifidn expression. The value of "segname"
is resolved to the string "@curseg" which, in the example, is identical to
"code1".
