SUMMARY
=======

If you are using an 8514 video adapter with a secondary VGA adapter on a 386
system (also referred to as a passthrough VGA), you may encounter problems when
switching between MS-DOS virtual machines (VMs) in full screen mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem can be easily identified with the following default configuration
(using Program Manager as your shell):

1. Start Windows in 386 enhanced mode.

2. In Program Manager, start an MS-DOS virtual machine (VM) by selecting MS-DOS
   Prompt in the Main Group and pressing the ENTER key.

3. The MS-DOS VM starts full screen and presents you with the standard prompt.

4. Press ALT+ESC. The MS-DOS VM is reduced to an icon, and Program Manager is
   now the active application.

5. Press ALT+TAB (releasing the ALT key first). The icon for the MS-DOS Prompt
   is highlighted. When you releasing the ALT key, the MS-DOS VM appears in full
   screen mode.

If the screen for the MS-DOS VM is all white, then the VGA card may have a
problem with the DAC (digital-to-analog converter). You may want to either
remove the VGA card from your system or contact the board manufacturer to see if
there is a way for you to update your VGA adapter.

NOTE: The display is correct if you run the MS-DOS VM in a Window (ALT+ENTER). To
restore the display, type the following MS-DOS command at the MS-DOS command
prompt, and then press ENTER:

   MODE CO80
