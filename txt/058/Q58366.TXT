SUMMARY
=======

This article contains tips on installing a copy of Microsoft Windows on a shared
network drive.

For complete instructions when setting up a server installation of Windows 3.0,
refer to the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version 3.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following information may be helpful if you are installing a copy of Windows
on a shared network drive, so that it can be run by multiple users.

 - All files in the shared Windows directory must be set to read-only. This can
   be done from within the Windows File Manager, or by using the MS-DOS ATTRIB
   command (see your MS-DOS manual). If this is not done, users may get sharing
   violations while running Windows.

   NOTE: On a Novell network, the share directory access rights under group
   "everyone" can be set to read and file scan only to achieve the same result.

 - Make sure that the shared Windows directory does not contain any .INI or .GRP
   files, or a copy of WIN.COM. Setup will create these files in the user's
   personal Windows directory.
