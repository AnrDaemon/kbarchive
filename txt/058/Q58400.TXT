SUMMARY
=======

One of Microsoft's promotional advertisements for Flight Simulator Version 4.00
shows a picture of the experimental aircraft that, as the caption states, has
been modified to resemble a B-2 bomber.

It is not possible to produce this design in Flight Simulator Version 4.00
because of limits on the design parameters that were established in accordance
with the flight equations.
