MORE INFORMATION
================

Mouse drivers are copied to the hard drive only if they are needed to replace an
existing older version of the same driver.

HIMEM.SYS is copied to the root directory of Drive C because of potential
problems with hard drive partitioning drivers.

HIMEM.SYS is always placed first in the CONFIG.SYS file. If Windows is installed
on a drive other than C:, and a hard drive partitioning driver is used,
HIMEM.SYS will be listed before the partitioning driver and thus will not load
because its drive is not present before the partitioning driver is loaded.
Always placing HIMEM.SYS in the root directory of C: solves this problem.
