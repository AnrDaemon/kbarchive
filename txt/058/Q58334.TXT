[PORTS] SECTION
---------------

The [ports] section lists all available communications ports and
defines default values; it also lists files to which printer output
may be sent.

The [ports] section can contain the following settings:

<portname>:=<baud-rate, parity, word-length, stop-bits>[[,p]]

Purpose: The <portname> keyname must be the name of the communications
         port as it is recognized by DOS. The <baud-rate> value
         specifies the port's baud rate. The <word-length> value
         gives the length of a word (in bits). The <stop-bits> value
         gives the number of stop bits to be used. The [[,p]] option
         specifies that hardware handshaking is in effect.

To change: Choose the Ports icon from the Control Panel window.
