The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Mail version 3.00 allows you to create personal groups of those users
you frequently send messages to through the Personal Groups command (on the Mail
menu).

In Microsoft Mail version 2.00, a user cannot create his or her own personal
groups unless that user is the Network Manager. However, since it is possible to
paste text into the Names box on the addressing screen, an alternative to this
is to save a list of names separated by semicolons in the Scrapbook, then recall
them later when addressing a mail message.

To save a list of names in the Scrapbook, do the following:

1. Open a word processing program.

2. Type the names of the users in the group, separating each name with a
   semicolon. Do not insert spaces or other characters except where they appear
   in the user names.

3. Copy these names without copying the end-of-line character.

4. From the Apple menu, choose Scrapbook, then choose Paste from the Edit menu.

To use these names from the Scrapbook to address a mail message, do the
following:

1. From the Apple menu, choose Scrapbook and move to the screen that contains
   the desired list of names.

2. From the Edit menu, choose Copy to copy the names.

3. From the Apple menu, choose Microsoft Mail 2.0 and select the type of message
   to send.

4. Click the Address icon, then press COMMAND+V to paste the names into the
   Names box. Mail will not allow Paste to be chosen from the Edit menu using
   the mouse.
