SUMMARY
=======

To add the file named fileName to a specified message as an enclosure, use the
following syntax:

   msmail (addEnclosure, messageRef [,fileName])

The filename "fileName" can be a complete path (for example, "Hard
Disk:Documents:Report") or a partial path (for example, ":OtherStacks:Demo").
Partial paths start from the folder that contains HyperCard.

"messageRef" is a reference to a selected message obtained by making a call to
the msmail function using a parameter that returns a message reference.

If no filename is given, the standard Macintosh Open File dialog box is
presented, and you can select the file that is sent.

Microsoft Mail version 2.00 does not support adding multiple enclosures, but Mail
version 3.00 does. To add multiple enclosures, make multiple calls to
AddEnclosure.

This information is taken from the "Microsoft Mail HyperCard Interface
Documentation."
