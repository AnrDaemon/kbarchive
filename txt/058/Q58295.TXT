SUMMARY
=======

Printing from the Microsoft Windows 3.0 PaintJet driver may be fairly slow. The
slowness occurs because the driver is designed to rasterize a metafile, which
produces a very large amount of data. The data is then sent to the Print
Manager, which needs to write this to a temporary file (this could be more than
a megabyte of data).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The best PaintJet print speed can be obtained by checking the "High Speed Direct
LPT" option in the driver. This bypasses the Print Manager and improves print
speed, although it may take longer to regain control of your Windows
application.

This behavior is by design of the HP PaintJet driver option "High- Speed Direct
LPT." With this option turned on, Print Manager is not used, regardless of
whether it is selected in the Control Panel.

If this option is turned off, Print Manager should appear as expected.
