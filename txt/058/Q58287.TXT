If you use Autodesk's AutoCAD application with a plotter, AutoCAD queries
the plotter interactively for document size and other parameters.

When you run AutoCAD under Microsoft Windows 3.0, the return values from
the plotter are incorrect. AutoCAD generates an error message similar to
the following:

   Invalid hard clip limits returned from plotter;
   -211801,21181,16601

AutoCAD polls the communications port to read the data sent by the plotter.
Because the data read is not interrupt driven, you may lose data if other
virtual machines are allowed to be scheduled while this application is
trying to poll data from the communications port.

The only workaround at this time is to run AutoCAD VM-exclusive.
