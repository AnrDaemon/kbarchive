-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Forbin Project Qmodem versions 4.0 and 4.5 MS-DOS
communications program under Microsoft Windows 3.0 or 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode,
the system reboots.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Qmodem 4.0 and 4.5 attempt to use expanded memory,
but do not check for an error return when obtaining the LIM 3.2 expanded memory
page frame address. On machines where no LIM 3.2 compatible page frame is
available, Windows returns an error. Qmodem ignores the error, and attempts to
map data into a nonexistent expanded memory page frame address.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem, do one of the following:

 - Create a .PIF file that specifies a 0 (zero) limit for EMS memory in the
   Advanced Options dialog box; this disables EMS for the MS-DOS command prompt
   under Windows, which allows Qmodem to run properly.

 - Rearrange hardware adapters in the machine to free a 64K contiguous area in
   the upper memory area (UMA) (the area from A000 to EFFF hexadecimal).
