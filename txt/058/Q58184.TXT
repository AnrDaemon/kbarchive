SUMMARY
=======

Every Microsoft Mail server file has a unique serial number encoded within it.
Mail servers use this serial number to communicate with each other.
Consequently, you can install a particular server file on only one Macintosh in
the network. If you install the same server file on two Macintoshes at the same
time, one of them will automatically be removed from the network.

The Network Manager or a user can access the server serial number by signing into
the server and pressing the COMMAND+OPTION+? (question mark) keys
simultaneously. The Mail system information window displays the server serial
number, its name, and other information. When you first install a server, the
server's serial number will appear in the Chooser desk accessory (DA) as part of
the server's name when the Mail driver is selected.
