======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Vaccine is a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program designed to prevent
modification of files such as CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT. Vaccine causes
problems if it is loaded in memory when you install Microsoft Windows operating
system version 3.0, 3.1, or 3.11.

In addition, Vaccine's hard-drive write-protection program, Shelter, is not
compatible with SMARTDrive version 4.0 when SMARTDrive is configured for
write-behind caching.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Vaccine is loaded when you try to install Windows 3.0 or 3.1, Windows Setup
will hang, usually when Setup tries to modify the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
files. Symptoms include an unending beep tone (Vaccine's alarm) and loss of
keyboard control.

You should unload Vaccine before setting up Windows 3.1. You may also encounter
problems, such as beeping, while running Windows when Vaccine is loaded.

Using SMARTDrive with Vaccine's Shelter Program
-----------------------------------------------

Shelter is a hard disk-drive write-protection program included with Vaccine. If
SMARTDrive is configured for write-behind caching, you will receive the
following error message if SHELTER.EXE is loaded:

   Serious Disk Error

To avoid receiving this error message, and possible data loss, either restart the
computer without loading Shelter or configure SMARTDrive for read caching only
on the drive being write-protected. The following example sets SMARTDrive for
write-behind caching on drive C, and read-only caching on drive D, with a cache
size of 1 MB:

   smartdrv c+ d 1024
