SUMMARY
=======

It has been reported that Flight Simulator Version 4.00 will hang after a plane
crashes into the ground after a nose dive if crash detect is set to "OFF." The
plane may appear to be standing on its nose. Resetting the mode, by pressing the
PRINT SCREEN key, allows Flight Simulator to continue as usual.
