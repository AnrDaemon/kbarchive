The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Windows 3.0, certain DOS-related system errors (such as attempts to
write to a full disk, an unformatted floppy, or a write- protected disk) cause
Windows to display an error similar to the following

   System Error: Write protected disk

You then have to choose Cancel three times to exit the error dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

This is a feature of MS-DOS. Even though Windows recognizes the failure in one
pass, MS-DOS insists on performing two more retries. The same behavior can be
observed at the MS-DOS prompt outside of Windows.
