The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

IMPORTANT: All Microsoft Mail version 2.00 customers who have gateways installed
should be using the "MS Mail GW" file version 2.00b and the "Microsoft Mail
Server" file version 2.00b, both of which are located in the System Folder of
the Mail server. An updated "MS Mail GW" file is available through Microsoft End
User Sales and Service at (800) 426-9400 or Microsoft Customer Service at (206)
936-8661, but ONLY for customers using the AppleLink Gateway to Microsoft Mail.
Customers using other gateways must obtain an updated "MS Mail GW" file from the
developer of the gateway they are using. The Microsoft Mail server upgrade can
also be obtained at the above numbers.


Gateway servers are created by using the Gateway Installer program to install the
gateway resources in the data file of a Microsoft Mail server. The gateway
server is the Mail server that has the physical connection to the external mail
service (or any other service such as the stock exchange to receive stock
quotes). In the case of the AppleLink gateway, the gateway server has the modem,
which is used to connect to the AppleLink host, connected to the modem port.

Mail users registered on the gateway server have access to the gateway. When a
user on a gateway server sends a message to a recipient on the external service,
the Mail server passes information about the Mail message to the gateway. The
gateway then forwards the mail message to the external service.

Please note that the sending of gateway messages is based on gateway accounts
defined, if any, and scheduled connect times.
