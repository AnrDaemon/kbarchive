The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for MS-DOS, versions 2.2, 3.0, 3.11, 3.14, 4.0, 4.01, 4.05, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following are several reasons why CodeView doesn't provide
debugging support for spawned processes in MS-DOS:

1. MS-DOS is not a multitasking operating system. CodeView cannot start another
   thread/process to watch the execution of the spawned process.

2. MS-DOS does not provide debugging support for the MS-DOS BIOS calls
   (Interrupt 21h). Since all spawn() and exec() functions in MS-DOS must go
   through the BIOS to run, CodeView cannot follow the spawned program.

3. MS-DOS only recognizes 640K of memory; therefore, there is insufficient
   memory to debug a large program, since both the parent and child processes
   must reside in memory at the same time.
