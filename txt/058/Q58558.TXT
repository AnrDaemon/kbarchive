SUMMARY
=======

To add information to a form with nonstandard fields, use the following syntax:

   msmail (addField, messageRef, data, ident [,onlyOne] [,type])

For standard form types, use the simpler commands, such as addSubject and
addBody.

An application-specific message can use any 4-byte (4 character) value for a
field identification (ident). Multiple fields can be added with the same
"ident". A list of standard field idents can be found in the HyperCard SDK
version 3.00 documentation stack under "Advanced Mail Information."

For more information on field idents, query on the following words:

   getField and idmap

If only one field with a particular "ident" is allowed in a given message, pass a
value of "true" in "onlyOne" when adding that field to the message. When
"onlyOne" is set, addField removes from the message any fields with the
specified ident before adding the contents of data. If no value is passed for
"onlyOne", it defaults to "true".

"messageRef" is a reference to a selected message obtained by making a call to
the msmail function using a parameter that returns a message reference.

"data" is the data to be added to the specified field of the specified message.

The "type" parameter lets advanced users specify the type of the field to be
added. This must be passed only if you are creating nontext fields that do not
occur on the send screen for this message type. In all other cases, the type is
filled in automatically.

This information is taken from the "Microsoft Mail HyperCard Interface
Documentation." For additional information, see the getField function in the
documentation stack.
