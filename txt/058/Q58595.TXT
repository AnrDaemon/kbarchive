SUMMARY
=======

To return the time and date that a message was sent, use the following syntax:

   msmail (getDate, messageRef)=>date

The time is returned in standard Macintosh format (that is, in seconds since
midnight, January 1, 1904). Use the HyperCard command "convert" to change this
number into words. For example, use the following syntax:

   put msmail(getDate, messageRef) into sentDate
   convert sentDate to long date

"messageRef" is a reference to a selected message returned by GetMessage.

This information is taken from the "Microsoft Mail HyperCard Interface
Documentation."
