MORE INFORMATION
================

F1 Key Does Not Activate Help
-----------------------------

In Microsoft Windows 3.0 and 3.1 Solitaire (SOL.EXE), the F1 key does not
activate the Help Index. To work around this problem, from the Help menu choose
the Index command with the mouse or press ALT+H, I.

Help Does Not Close When Exiting Solitaire
------------------------------------------

If Help is active in Microsoft Windows 3.0 Solitaire, and you exit Solitaire
without quitting Help, Help does not close.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Solitaire versions 3.0 and 3.0a.
Due to design changes, this problem does not occur in Windows 3.1.

No Cards Are Displayed in Solitaire
-----------------------------------

If you start Solitaire (SOL.EXE) minimized, no cards are displayed when you
restore the window. This problem occurs if you have Solitaire on the WIN.INI
LOAD= line or if you run Solitaire from the Program Manager with the SHIFT key
pressed.

To start a new game, choose Deal from the Game menu.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows Solitaire version 3.0 and
3.0a. This problem does not occur in later versions of Windows.

Two Instances of Solitaire Cause Screen Redraw Problem
------------------------------------------------------

If you run two games of Solitaire and then close the first game, the second game
has screen redraw problems when you restore or maximize it.

The green background displays only where the cards can be placed, and a white
background displays everywhere else. This is a cosmetic problem only; you can
work around it by dealing the cards again. This works until Solitaire is again
minimized and then restored or maximized. If you run only one game of Solitaire,
this problem does not occur.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows Solitaire version 3.0 and
3.0a. This problem does not occur in later versions of Windows.

Icon Truncated When Solitaire Is Loaded with the LOAD= Option
-------------------------------------------------------------

The Microsoft Windows Solitaire icon is either truncated or nonexistent if you
use the LOAD= line in the WIN.INI file to load Solitaire. This problem only
occurs if SOL.EXE is the first program on the LOAD= line.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows Solitaire version 3.0 and
3.0a. This problem does not occur in later versions of Windows.
