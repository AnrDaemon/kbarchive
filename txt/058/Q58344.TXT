[STANDARD] SECTION
------------------

The [standard] section contains settings that are specific to running
Windows applications in standard mode.

The [standard] section can contain the following settings:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Int28Filter=<number>
Default: 10
Purpose: Specifies how many INT28 messages that Windows should reflect
         from standard mode to real mode. Windows will reflect every
         nth message, where n is the value of this setting. Increasing
         this value may reduce Windows' interference with background
         communications.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
NetHeapSize=<kilobytes>
Default: 8
Purpose: Specifies the size (in kilobytes) of the buffers that
         standard-mode Windows allocates in conventional memory for
         transferring data over a network. Some networks require a
         larger buffer than the default. Increasing this value will
         diminish the amount of memory available to applications.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
ReserveLowMemory=<kilobytes>
Default: 0
Purpose: Specifies the amount of conventional memory to be reserved
         for use by something other than Windows running in standard
         mode.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
