[PRINTERPORTS] SECTION
----------------------

The [PrinterPorts] section lists the active and inactive printers that
can be accessed by Windows device drivers, specifies the
communications port or ports to which the devices are connected, and
their corresponding timeout values.

The [PrinterPorts] section can contain settings of the following type:

<device-name>=<driver-name, port-name, TransmissionRetryTimeout,
               DeviceNotSelectedTimeout>

Purpose: The <device-name> keyname is the name of the device. The
         <driver-name> value is the driver filename. If a device is
         not currently connected, the <port-name> value should be the
         string specified in the NullPort setting (in the [windows]
         section).

         The <TransmissionRetryTimeout> value determines the amount of
         time (in seconds) allowed for attempted transmission retries.
         The <DeviceNotSelectedTimeout> value determines the number of
         seconds Print Manager will wait for a device to be switched
         on. If these values are not set for a particular port,
         Windows uses the default settings in the [windows] section.

To change: Choose the Printers icon from the Control Panel window.
