-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your network administrator disconnects you from an MSNet server, or the
server is rebooted while you are connected, Microsoft Windows 3.0 enhanced mode
drops to the MS-DOS command prompt when you access the disconnected network
resource.

CAUSE
=====

This is not a Windows problem; it occurs in a similar manner at the MS-DOS
command prompt outside of Windows. If you access the disconnected net drive from
MS-DOS, your system will stop responding (hang). This is an inherent problem in
most MSNet-redirector-based networks.

This problem does not occur in Microsoft LAN Manager or Novell NetWare.
