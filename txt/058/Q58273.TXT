SUMMARY
=======

If you are using Microsoft Windows Write and you open a file on drive A, edit
the file, and then save the file, one of the following error messages is
displayed if there is not enough free space on the disk to open the size of the
file you are modifying.

Windows 3.0, 3.0a
-----------------

   Insufficient disk space; delete one or more files to increase available disk
   space, or save to a different disk.

Windows 3.1, 3.11
-----------------

   Not enough disk space to complete this operation. Delete one or more files to
   increase available disk space and the try again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create its temporary file, Write requires at least an amount of free space on
the disk equal to the size of the file, not counting the space occupied by the
current version. This requirement is due to the way that Write (and all of the
Microsoft word processing products) saves the file and makes a backup.

When you save new changes to an existing file (for example, A:\FILE.WRI), Write
creates a temporary file on the same drive, and creates a new document with your
changes (for example, A:\XXX.TMP). If that operation is successful, Write checks
your Make Backup setting and, if appropriate, renames the original file to be
the backup (for example, A:\FILE.WRI is renamed to A:\FILE.BKP) or deletes it.
Finally, Write can rename the new temporary file to be your real document (for
example, A:\XXX.TMP is renamed to A:\FILE.WRI).

This step takes advantage of the speed in renaming a file, rather than making a
copy, so the TEMP environment variable is not used.
