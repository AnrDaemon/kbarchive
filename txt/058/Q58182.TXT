SUMMARY
=======

A Macintosh will react in two ways when it is running low on memory and the
Microsoft Mail desk accessory (DA) is chosen from the Apple menu:

1. An error message may appear stating that there is not enough memory to open
   Microsoft Mail.

2. The Macintosh beeps. Under severe low-memory conditions, Microsoft Mail only
   beeps instead of giving a dialog box that states the problem.

Both conditions require some memory to be freed up on the Macintosh, either by
closing windows or applications; removing unnecessary fonts, DAs, and INITs; or
turning off the RAM Cache in the Control Panel.

A possible workaround, if running under MultiFinder, is to hold down the OPTION
key and select the Mail DA. This opens Mail in the application memory of the
current application.

Another reason for the Macintosh to just beep when a desk accessory is selected
is if the DA Handler file is not present in the System Folder when running under
MultiFinder.
