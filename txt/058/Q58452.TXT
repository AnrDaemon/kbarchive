SUMMARY
=======

To access fields from nonstandard message types created using the Microsoft Mail
versions 2.0 or 3.0 Forms Designer, the identification codes for those fields
are needed. There are no built-in functions for returning the values from these
custom forms, so to access them, these codes are passed to the Microsoft Mail
function call using the parameter "getField".

To find these codes, launch HyperCard and open the stack that contains the custom
form that will be read. In the HyperCard message box on the Send screen or Read
screen of the form's stack, type the following:

   "show background field idmap" (without the quotation marks)

A field then appears, displaying the mapping between the form's field names and
the Mail codes. The idmap field holds the 4-character identification code and
the names of the custom fields and buttons.

Before closing the form, hide the field by typing the following in the message
box:

   "hide background field idmap" (without the quotation marks)

The same field identification codes can be used with the Microsoft Excel Software
Development Kit (SDK).
