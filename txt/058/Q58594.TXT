SUMMARY
=======

AddMacResource adds the data pointed to by a handle to the resource fork of the
current stack. The following is an example:

   msmail(addMacResource, handle, type [,name] [,ID])

The resource is stored with the given resource type, ID, and resource name.

If no "ID" is specified, a unique ID is chosen for the resource. If no "name" is
specified, it remains blank. Any resources in the current stack with the same
type and ID or type and name are removed.

"handle" is a Macintosh handle to a resource. This value is returned by a call to
getMacResource.

The "type" parameter lets advanced users specify the type of the field to be
added. This must be passed only if you are creating nontext fields that do not
occur on the send screen for this message type. In all other cases, the type
will be filled in automatically.

This information is taken from the "Microsoft Mail HyperCard Interface
Documentation."
