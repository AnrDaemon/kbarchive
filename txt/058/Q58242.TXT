KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a PIF file that runs the MS-DOS version 3.x FORMAT.COM utility;
the PIF may have a question mark in the Parameters field. When you run the PIF,
enter a: or b: as the parameter, and then choose the OK button, FORMAT.COM will
start and then print the following error message:

   Drive letter must be specified

FORMAT.COM then exits without doing anything.

This PIF file works properly with Windows/386 Versions 2.x.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do not run FORMAT.COM directly; instead, run
FORMAT.COM from the MS-DOS command prompt, or run FORMAT.COM from the file
manager under the Disk Menu.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Windows version 3.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.

This problem does not occur with MS-DOS version 4.0 or 4.01.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.00a
