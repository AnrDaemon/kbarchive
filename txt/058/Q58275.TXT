-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The /E parameter for the WIN.INI file swapdisk= setting is not supported by
Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, or 3.11.

The swapdisk= /E option allows MS-DOS applications to be swapped directly
to expanded memory under Microsoft Windows/286 versions 2.x.

Instead of using this parameter, create a RAM drive in expanded memory
with the RAMDRIVE.SYS utility included with Windows 3.0, 3.0a, and 3.1,
and swap to the RAM drive by placing its drive letter on the swapdisk=
line.

Note that the swapdisk= setting applies to Windows 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
only in real (available only in 3.0 and 3.0a) and standard mode, not
in 386 enhanced mode.

Additional query words: 3.0 3.00 3.0a 3.00a 3.1 3.10 3.11 win30 win31
