If your network software is loaded in the High Memory Area (the HMA, or
first 64K of extended memory), you may experience problems running
Microsoft Windows 3.0. If this is the case, try disabling the network's HMA
option. Consult your network documentation for more information. An example
of this problem can occur with LAN Manager 1.00 or 1.01 networks running on
MS-DOS 4.00.
