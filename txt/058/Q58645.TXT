DOCUMENT:Q58645  30-JUL-2001  [lanman]
TITLE   :UB Drivers Specified in LANMAN.INI/AUTOEXEC.BAT Truncated
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

If the combined length (in characters) of the filenames and the loader exceeds
128 characters, MS-DOS truncates the string and issues a "file not found" error
message.

CAUSE
=====

This message is seen only when the loader is executed from the AUTOEXEC.BAT
file. However, if the command is issued from the LANMAN.INI file from the
services group, it produces an unsatisfactory error, "could not load ub
drivers."

WORKAROUND
==========

Limit the sum character length (spaces inclusive) to be equal to or less than
128 characters.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Example
-------

Assume LAN Manager operates from the directory LANMAN20.DOS. The following
command is in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

c:\lanman20.dos\drivers\ub\loadniu.exe -r -d -m:d8 -p:4 -i:5 c:\lanman20.do
drivers\ub\ex2niuw.xfm c:\lanman20.dos\drivers\ub\stdlc

At run time, the last file will be truncated to

   c:\lanman20.dos\drivers\ub\ 

and the following error message will be issued:

   File not found

Additional query words: 2.00 2.10 dos fail
