You cannot ALT+TAB out of an MS-DOS application that is performing
constant network access, such as Attachmate "Extra!", under Microsoft
Windows 3.0 standard or real modes.

Using ALT+TAB is not a problem in Windows 3.0 386 enhanced mode because in
this mode, Windows can run MS-DOS applications in the background; thus, the
constant network access may continue.

Extra! is constantly receiving datagram Network Control Blocks (NCBs)
while it is loaded (even when run as a TSR). If you ALT+TAB out during
its operation, Extra! freezes in the current mode and loses the
connection.
