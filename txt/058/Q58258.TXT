-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are attempting to receive help from a Windows application, such as
Microsoft Excel, running under Microsoft Windows, one of the following error
messages is displayed:

   This is not a valid helpfile

   -or-

   This is not a Windows help file

CAUSE
=====

These errors occur because your WIN.INI file [extensions] section contains the
following entry:

      [extensions]
      hlp=winhelp.exe ^.hlp

This entry allows help files to be opened in Windows Help by running them in File
Manager. However, Windows applications that use a help module with the extension
.HLP (such as EXCELHLP.HLP) do not function correctly with this entry present.

Additional query words: 3.00 win30 3.00a 3.10 3.11 winhelp
