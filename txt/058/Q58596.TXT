SUMMARY
=======

To disable notification alerts, use the following syntax:

   msmail (enableNotify [, flag])

If "flag" has the value "false", all forms of new mail notification (for example,
alert windows, chimes, menu bar icons) are disabled.

If "flag" is "true" (or no flag is specified and it defaults to "true"), the
user's notification options are restored to the values in the Mail Preferences
screen.

This information is taken from the "Microsoft Mail HyperCard Interface
Documentation."
