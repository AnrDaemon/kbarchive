SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to redirect stdout to a file from a C program, then
restore the original stdout at a later point in the same program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The C function typically used to redirect stdout or stdin is freopen(). To
redirect stdout to a file called FILE.TXT, use the following call:

   freopen( "file.txt", "w", stdout );

This statement causes all subsequent output, which is typically directed towards
stdout, to go to the file FILE.TXT.

To return stdout to the display (the default stdout), use the following call:

   freopen( "CON", "w", stdout );

In both of these cases, check the return value of freopen() to make sure that the
redirection actually took place.

Below is a short program to demonstrate the redirection of stdout:

Sample Code
-----------

   // Compile options needed: none

   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <stdlib.h>

   void main(void)
   {
      FILE *stream ;
      if((stream = freopen("file.txt", "w", stdout)) == NULL)
         exit(-1);

      printf("this is stdout output\n");

      stream = freopen("CON", "w", stdout);

      printf("And now back to the console once again\n");
   }

This program assumes that stdout is to be redirected toward the console at the
end of the program.
