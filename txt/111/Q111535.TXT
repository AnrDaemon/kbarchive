Trying to log onto a Windows NT Advanced Server domain with the "Access
this computer from the network" policy not assigned to the Everyone group
causes the following error message to appear on Windows for Workgroups
computers:

   No domain server was available to validate your password. You were logged on
   without password validation.

To avoid this error message, start User Manager for Domains on the Windows
NT Advanced Server server for the domain and perform the following steps:

1. Choose User Rights from the Policies menu.

2. Select the "Access this computer from the network" right.

3. Select Administrator and Everyone.

4. Choose OK.
