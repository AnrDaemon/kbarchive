KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

DoubleSpace may not be able to convert a Stacker 3.0 compressed drive if the
stacked volume has a filename other than STACVOL.DSK. If the stacked volume is
not named STACVOL.DSK, you may receive the following error message:

   Dblspace was not able to convert your Stacker drives to dblspace format

CAUSE
=====

The conversion process searches specifically for the stacked volume named
STACKVOL.DSK.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, rename the stacked volume STACVOL.DSK. In addition,
change the reference to the stacked volume in the CONFIG.SYS file. For example:

      device=c:\stacker\stacker.com c:\stackvol.dsk
