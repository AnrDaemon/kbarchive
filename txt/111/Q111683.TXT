TITLE   :New Installation of WFWG with IPX.COM Gives Erroneous Dialog
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows for Workgroups (WFWG) version 3.11 to a new directory,
and IPX.COM is running, the following message is displayed:

   The files for IPX Support Driver (Monolithic) with NetBIOS transport are
   currently installed on your computer.

   Do you want to replace them with the version you are installing now?

   If you want to replace all later files with the version you are installing
   now, press Yes to All.

This message is displayed even though you are installing Windows for Workgroups
to a new directory, and therefore do not have NetWare 3.x workstation drivers
installed that need to be updated.

CAUSE
=====

After Setup copies the NetWare files to your hard disk (including VIPX.386), the
SETUP.INF file instructs Setup to copy them once again. As a result, Setup
detects the files it just copied to your hard disk and displays the message
noted above.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups version
3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, choose Yes to update the files and continue Setup.
Although Setup does not actually update the files, it copies the same version of
VIPX.386 to your hard disk and then continues normally.
