SYMPTOMS
========

When you use any of the Windows for Workgroups Super VGA video drivers with the
Compaq QVision video card, your system stops responding (hangs) when you try to
start Windows.

To work around this problem, use the VGA video driver or one supplied from
Compaq.

To change your video driver:

1. Change your current directory to the Windows directory. For example, type "cd
   \windows" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt, and
   then press ENTER.

2. Run Windows Setup by typing "setup" (without the quotation marks) at the
   MS-DOS command prompt, and then press ENTER.

3. Choose a different video driver, and then exit Setup.
