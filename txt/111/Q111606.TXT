TITLE   :BUG: ROP2 Code Applied Incorrectly in Pie() Function
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When calling the Windows SDK function Pie() using a ROP2 code other than the
default R2_COPYPEN, and using a pen with a width greater than 1 (one), you may
notice that the pie border is not drawn correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The pen position is applied incorrectly and overlaps part of the interior.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Windows version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For a demonstration of this bug, run the sample program SHOWGDI that comes with
the Windows 3.1 SDK or with Microsoft Visual C++. Set the pen width to greater
than 1 and make sure that the pen color and brush color are different. For
example, set the pen width to 5 and the pen color to RGB(0,255,0). Set the brush
color to RGB(255,0,255). Set the ROP2 code to R2_XORPEN and then draw a pie. You
will see three color ranges. The pen position is applied incorrectly and
overlaps part of the interior.
