TITLE   :SMTP: Gateway Does Not Get Outgoing Messages from Postoffice
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft SMTP Mail Gateway may not pick up outgoing messages from the
gateway postoffice. When looking at the log file, the SMTPGET process is never
spawned or executed.

CAUSE
=====

A zero-length FROM_NC.API file probably exists in the M:\SMTP sub-directory.
This file may be created if the gateway is low on memory and causes the gateway
to skip the SMTPGET process completely.

RESOLUTION
==========

Delete the FROM_NC.API file. Ensure the log file shows at least 40K of
contiguous memory (in the Idling line, after the word "largest"). If the gateway
does not have enough memory, load your MS-DOS, TCP/IP, and other network
software outside of conventional memory, and make sure no
terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs are being loaded.
