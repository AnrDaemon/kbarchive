TITLE   :BUG: Debug Kernel Ignores Fatal Exits When OutputTo=
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

By default, the Windows debugging kernel sends its debug messages to the AUX
device (which maps to the COM1 port). When the debug output from the Windows
kernel is redirected by using OutputTo=NUL or OutputTo=<filename> in the
[DEBUG] section of the SYSTEM.INI file, Fatal Exit messages are ignored
automatically.

RESOLUTION
==========

This behavior is by design of the Windows debugging kernel and there is no other
flag to control the output of Fatal Exit messages even if you have a serial
terminal connected to the COM1 or COM2 port.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Windows version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
