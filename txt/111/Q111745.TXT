TITLE   :PRB: "Position off Screen" in FoxPro for Macintosh Application
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.5b,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.5b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Versions 7.0 and 7.1 of the Macintosh system software ship with TrueType
versions of many standard Macintosh fonts. Earlier versions of the system
software (6.0.x) include these fonts in bitmap form. The bitmap and TrueType
versions of the same font have different fontmetrics, which yield unpredictable
results.

For example, if development is done in FoxPro for Macintosh using the TrueType
versions of these fonts and the application is subsequently run on a system
containing bitmap versions of the fonts, object alignment may not be consistent
with what is shown on the development machine, and "Position is off the screen"
error messages may occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent anomalous behavior, machines that will be running the application
should have the same type (bitmap or TrueType) of fonts installed as were used
during development.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The current versions of the Macintosh system software contain TrueType versions
of these system fonts:

   Courier
   Geneva
   Helvetica
   Monaco
   New York
   Palatino
   Times
