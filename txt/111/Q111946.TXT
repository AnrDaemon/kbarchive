TITLE   :X400: Slow Message Transfer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.0,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 may process messages slowly.

CAUSE
=====

Slow message transfer may result from a large (4000 or more names) custom
address map. The X.400 gateway reads the custom address map file (MAPTBL.OUT) in
1K blocks. If a large custom address map exists, it takes time to read the
entire file. Other X.400 gateway read activity is handled in 4K blocks.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or

   File Name      Version

This hotfix has been posted to the following Internet location as X400gy2k.exe:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/mail/gateways-public/All-Y2K/


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400
versions 3.0 and 3.2.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft has made two changes to the X.400 gateway to increase the search speed
when you use a custom mapping table:

 - The algorithm used to search the custom mapping table has been changed to
   search first on the X.400 O/R attribute most likely to be unique (the surname
   attribute).

 - A parameter is now available in the X400GATE.INI file that allows you to move
   the mapping table to the local gateway computer. The table can then be loaded
   into a RAMDrive for quick access. You should add the new parameter to the
   [Microsoft X.400 gateway] section, following the example below:

      [Microsoft X.400 gateway]
      LocalCustomMappingFile=c:\maptbl.out

For more information about the custom mapping table, please see the X.400 Gateway
"Administrator's Guide." For more information about the RAMDrive program, please
see your Microsoft MS-DOS documentation.
