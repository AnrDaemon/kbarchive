TITLE   :FORMAT /S and SYS Copy Invalid System File with 4DOS or NDOS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.0,5.0a,6.0,6.2,6.21,6.22

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you use the MS-DOS FORMAT /S or SYS command to create a system disk, you
receive the following error message when you try to use that disk to start your
system:

   Bad or Missing Command Interpreter
   Enter correct name of Command Interpreter (e.g., C:\COMMAND.COM)

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs if JP Software's 4DOS.COM, Symantec's NDOS.COM, or another
third-party replacement for MS-DOS COMMAND.COM was loaded as the command
interpreter at the time you created the system disk. The FORMAT /S and SYS
commands copy the file currently specified in the COMSPEC environment (for
example, NDOS.COM or 4DOS.COM) to the system disk being created as
"COMMAND.COM."

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, replace the third-party shell, NDOS.COM or 4DOS.COM,
with MS-DOS COMMAND.COM, then transfer the system files to the disk again using
the MS-DOS FORMAT /S or SYS command.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The products NDOS and 4DOS are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
or reliability.
