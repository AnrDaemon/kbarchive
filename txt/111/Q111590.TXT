TITLE   :BUG: Some TrueType Character Pairs Run Together on VGA
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On some displays such as the standard VGA display that ships with Windows 3.1,
certain TrueType font character pairs do not have any space between them and run
together. For example, when using the Arial TrueType font at a point size of 14
or greater, the characters "f7" don't have any space between them.

CAUSE
=====

The standard VGA display driver does not support one-pass opaquing of the entire
glyph black box so GDI must simulate. The simulation is not done correctly for
certain characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are using TextOut() to display the text and this slight cosmetic problem
is not acceptable, you can use the ExtTextOut() function and specify the spacing
between the characters.
