 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1

When the Mail post office is initially created under Windows NT, the
network and post office names are read from the WORKGROUP= and
COMPUTERNAME= lines in the [Network] section of the Windows for Workgroups
SYSTEM.INI file. If no SYSTEM.INI is present, the network name defaults to
WINDOWS and the post office name defaults to the mailbox name of the
postoffice administrator.

Since these default settings are set when the post office is created,
changing the postoffice administrator mailbox after installation will not
change the post office name. The only way to get a different post office
name is to create a SYSTEM.INI file with at least a [Network] section and
the following lines:

   [Network]
   computername=<desired post office name>
   workgroup=<desired network name>

After creating this file, recreate the post office.  For information on how
to delete and recreate the post office, query on the following words in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   postoffice, remove or recreate

To check what the Network and post office names are, choose the About Mail
option from the Help menu or choose Details in the Postoffice Manager
dialog box.

This article is not applicable to Windows NT 4.x.
