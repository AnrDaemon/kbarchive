TITLE   :BUG: IsBadStringPtr() Reports Bad String as Valid
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under a particular condition, IsBadStringPtr() will report that a bad string is
valid. If the pointer passed to IsBadStringPtr() refers to a block of memory of
size 0xFFFF and is filled with all nonzero data, IsBadStringPtr() returns 0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Windows version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For IsBadStringPtr() to validate a string, it must be passed a pointer to valid
memory and the string must contain a NULL character that terminates the string.

The following code illustrates the error:

   #include <windows.h>
   #include <windowsx.h>
   #include <memory.h>

   LPSTR lpPtr;
   BOOL fRet;

        // GlobalAllocPtr is a macro in WINDOWSX.H
   lpPtr = GlobalAllocPtr(GMEM_MOVEABLE, 0XFFFF);

   _fmemset(lpPtr, 'Q', 0xFFFF);

   Ret = IsBadStringPtr(lpPtr, 0xFFFF);

   if (fRet)  // ... etcetera, fRet incorrectly contains zero.
