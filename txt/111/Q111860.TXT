SUMMARY
=======

A hard carriage return character is entered automatically after column 78 in a
message sent from version 3.x of Microsoft Mail for Windows or a version 3.x of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MS-DOS architecture requires that text have a hard carriage return (Carriage
Return and Line Feed) every 78 characters in the message. FFAPI- based gateway,
such as Mail Gateway to SMTP or Mail Gateway to PROFS, are MS-DOS based and
follow the 78 character per line architecture.

If you are sending messages to another Microsoft Mail user, you can eliminate
this 78 character wrapping by sending mail indirect via the gateway. This method
is called Backboning, and it will turn encapsulation on and prevent the 78
character wrapping.

If you are sending to a non-Microsoft Mail user, send any text that requires more
than 78 character columns per line as an attachment.
