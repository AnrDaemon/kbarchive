The Windows NT Resource Guide, Volume 1 of the Windows NT Resource Kit,
incorrectly describes a technical diagram of the Windows NT networking
model in Chapter 15, titled "Windows NT Networking Architecture." In the
first and second paragraph on page 572, it states:

   ...Figure 15.5 includes network adapter cards to illustrate that you can
   use multiple network adapter cards on a computer running Windows NT.

   The model also shows a serial driver and serial card.

These statements are incorrect because figure 15.5 on page 571 does not
show network adapter cards nor serial cards. It illustrates only the
physical layer.
