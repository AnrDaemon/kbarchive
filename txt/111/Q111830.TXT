SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to send a fax to a European number, Microsoft At Work PC Fax
continues trying to dial the number but never actually send the fax. At Work PC
Fax does not generate an error in this situation.

CAUSE
=====

European phones usually transmit ring signals at the same pitch as a United
States busy signal. Although most modems can distinguish between the two, some
cannot. This prevents the fax from being sent since it detects a busy signal.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, enable the Blind Dialing option in Control Panel.
To do this, choose the Fax icon, choose Setup, and then choose Dialing. In the
Dialing dialog box, select the Blind Dialing option, then restart Microsoft
Mail.

NOTE: A disadvantage to this workaround is that it disables redial for other
numbers.
