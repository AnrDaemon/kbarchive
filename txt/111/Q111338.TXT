The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Vector fonts do not rotate properly with a text alignment set to other than the
top left.

To reproduce this problem, create a logical font for the Script vector font. Call
SetTextAlign() to set the text alignment to TA_BASELINE and TA_CENTER. Rotate
the font, perhaps in a whirl pattern as the FONTEST sample does. Note that the
rotation axis is skewed in the northwest- southeast direction. This problem
occurs in all mapping modes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Windows versions 3.0 and 3.1.
