The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After running Microsoft Windows for Workgroups (WFWG) version 3.11 for several
hours, you can connect to other workstations and other network features still
work, but no one can connect to your workstation.

CAUSE
=====

If you are using the Intel EtherExpress 16 network interface card (NIC) with the
EXP16ODI.COM MAC driver, the server portion of Windows for Workgroups 3.11 may
stop functioning. You can use other network features; however, your workstation
is unable to act as a server until it is rebooted.

It appears that NWNBLINK.386 resets the NIC and the ODI MAC driver does not
replace the multicast list for the network after the NIC is reset.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
as it becomes available.
