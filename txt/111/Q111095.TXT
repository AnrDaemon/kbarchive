TITLE   :BUG: Nonscrolling Region in Help File Topic Does Scroll
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows Help file topic that has been formatted to provide a nonscrolling
region does scroll.

CAUSE
=====

A BUILDTAGS section was used in the Help project file to exclude the preceding
topic from the build. The subsequent topic with formatting for a nonscrolling
region will behave as if it was not formatted to be a nonscrolling region. In
other words, the region will scroll.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Help Compiler version 3.1. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Formatting for a nonscrolling region is specified by using the RTF \keepn format
or by using the "Keep Paragraph With Next" command in Word for Windows.
