MORE INFORMATION
================

This update contains the MSMAIL.EXE file, a replacement for the MSMAIL.EXE file
that is included with versions 3.0b and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows. This
resolves the following problems:

 - When an open custom message is deleted from a shared folder, the message
   header still appears in the folder. Trying to open the message again results
   in the error

   The message cannot be accessed.

 - You cannot do a Reply, Reply All, or Forward on a custom message that is
   located in a shared folder.

   NOTE: For this problem to be resolved, two files must be updated: the
   MSMAIL.EXE file (included in this update) and the MAPI.DLL file (update
   included in MAPIUPD.EXE on the MSL).

 - An error is now generated when the ACCESS.GLB file is locked open and a user
   attempts to change his or her password.

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

After you download MAILUPD.EXE to a clean directory, run it (by typing "mailupd"
(without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt) to extract the contents of
the file. You should receive the following files:

   MSMAIL.EXE (300,560 bytes, dated 04-15-95, 9:24 P.M.)
   README.TXT

To replace your MSMAIL.EXE file
-------------------------------

1. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

   " copy <path>:\msmail.exe <destination>" (without the quotation
   marks)

   where <path> is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
   extracting MAILUPD.EXE file and <destination> is the drive and
   directory where your MSMAIL.EXE file currently resides. For example, if you
   ran the self-extracting file from the TEST directory on drive D, and your
   MSMAIL.EXE file is located in the MAILEXE directory on drive C, type the
   following command:

   " copy d:\test\msmail.exe c:\mailexe" (without the quotation marks)

2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

   " copy <mailexe>\setup.inf <mailexe>\setupinf.old" (without the
   quotation marks)

   where <mailexe> is the complete path to the directory containing the
   Microsoft Mail for Windows SETUP.EXE program. For example, if SETUP.EXE is
   located in the MAILEXE directory on drive C, type the following command:

   " copy c:\mailexe\setup.inf c:\mailexe\setupinf.old" (without the quotation
   marks)

3. Using any text editor, edit the SETUP.INF file. In the [MsMail Prog] section,
   replace the following line

   "00" = 1, msmail.exe,,,, 1993-03-09, !DECOMPRESS,, OLDER, !READONLY,,,,,,
   299904,,,, 3.2.0.4027,

   with:

   " "00" = 1, msmail.exe,,,, 1995-04-05, !DECOMPRESS,, OLDER, !READONLY,,,,,,
   300560,,,, 3.2.0.4085," (without the quotation marks)

   Save the file and close the text editor.

   NOTE: For these changes to affect the entire network, each existing user must
   run Setup again.
