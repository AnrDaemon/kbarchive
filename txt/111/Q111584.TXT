TITLE   :BUG: Occasional Gap Between Adjacent Pie() Wedges
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Pie() function is used to draw two pie wedges with the same bounding
rectangle and the end point of the first wedge is equal to the start point of
the second wedge, there can be a gap between adjacent wedges. This gap only
occurs occasionally, and with certain pie sizes and start-and-end points.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Windows versions 3.0 and 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior can be reproduced using the following code fragment on a VGA
display:

Sample Code
-----------

   #define     xLeft     (25)
   #define     yTop     (25)
   #define     xRight     (450)
   #define     yBottom     (450)
   #define     xMiddle     ((xLeft + xRight) / 2)
   #define     yMiddle     ((yTop + yBottom) / 2)
   {
   HBRUSH hbrushRed, hbrushBlue, hbrushOld;

   hbrushRed = CreateSolidBrush(RGB(255, 0, 0));
   hbrushBlue = CreateSolidBrush(RGB(0, 0, 255));

   hbrushOld = SelectObject(hdc, hbrushRed);
   Pie(hdc, xLeft, yTop, xRight, yBottom, xRight, yMiddle, xRight, yTop);
   SelectObject(hdc, hbrushBlue);
   Pie(hdc, xLeft, yTop, xRight, yBottom, xRight, yTop, xMiddle, yTop);

   SelectObject(hdc, hbrushOld);
   DeleteObject(hbrushRed);
   DeleteObject(hbrushBlue);
   }
