SUMMARY

The boot partition on a Compaq computer with Compaq's SmartSCSI disk controller
is limited to 7.9 gigabytes (GB).

following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE : Boot Partition Created During Setup Limited to 4 Gigabytes

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Compaq Smart Controller allows you to create logical drives up to 14 GB.
However, if you set the boot partition to anything larger than 7.9 GB, Windows
NT Setup fails immediately, and an error message appears stating that the
bootable partition is too large.

This error message appears because no miniport driver is loaded to initialize the
Compaq controller. Consequently, the drive geometry is reported to the system
through the BIOS. Therefore, the limitation is a result of the 7.9 GB limit
imposed by the SmartSCSI BIOS.

Compaq uses the SmartSCSI controllers on both Proliant and SystemPro models.

You can call Compaq technical support at (800) 652-6672.
