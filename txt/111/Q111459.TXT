TITLE   :CONFIG and AUTOEXEC on Compressed and Host Drive Do Not Match
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to upgrade to MS-DOS 6.2 while you are running AddStor SuperStor, you
may receive the following error message:

   Error: Setup cannot install MS-DOS on your computer. The copy of the
   CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file on your compressed drive does not match the
   corresponding file on your uncompressed drive

CAUSE
=====

SuperStor maintains two copies of the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files: one on
the compressed drive and the other on the uncompressed drive. If these files are
not identical, you receive the above error.

RESOLUTION
==========

To make the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files identical on both the compressed
and uncompressed drives, do the following:

If the compressed drive (C in this example) has the more current versions of the
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files:

1. Delete the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files from the uncompressed drive (D
   in this example) by typing:

   " del d:\config.sys
   del d:\autoexec.bat" (without the quotation marks)

2. Copy the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files from the compressed drive to the
   uncompressed drive by typing:

   " copy c:\config.sys d:\config.sys
   copy c:\autoexec.bat d:\autoexec.bat" (without the quotation marks)

3. Run SETUP again.

If the uncompressed drive (D in this example) has the more current versions of
the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files:

1. Delete the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files from the compressed drive (C in
   this example) by typing:

   " del c:\config.sys
   del c:\autoexec.bat" (without the quotation marks)

2. Copy the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files from the uncompressed drive to the
   compressed drive by typing:

   " copy d:\config.sys c:\config.sys
   copy d:\autoexec.bat c:\autoexec.bat" (without the quotation marks)

3. Run SETUP again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In most cases, the copies of the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files on the
compressed drive are more current than those on the uncompressed drive. To
verify this, do the following:

1. Go to the uncompressed drive (usually drive D) by typing "D:" (without the
   quotation marks) at the C:\> prompt.

2. At the D:\> prompt, type "dir config.sys" (without the quotation marks)
   and write down the date of this file. Then type "dir autoexec.bat" (without
   the quotation marks) at the D:\> prompt and write down the date of this
   file if one exists.

3. Now go to the compressed drive (usually drive C) by typing "C:" (without the
   quotation marks) at the D:\> prompt.

4. Again, check the date of the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files using the
   process outlined in step 2.
