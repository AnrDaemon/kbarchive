SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using 32-bit disk access and you try to start Windows for
Workgroups, you receive the following error message:

   This program tried to access your hard disk in a way that is incompatible
   with the 32-bit disk-access feature. (wdctrl)

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur if BATTERY.PRO is specified in the CONFIG.SYS file on a
Texas Instruments (TI) model 4000 laptop computer running TI DOS version 6.0.

This error can also occur on other computers that use a 1993 AMI GreenCache 486
system BIOS chip set if the power management options are enabled in the
computer's CMOS setup. The error occurs if the computer's hardware does not
fully support the power management features.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, use any one of the following methods:

 - Disable 32-bit disk access in Windows Control Panel.

 - Remove or remark the BATTERY.PRO line in the CONFIG.SYS file.

   WARNING: According to Texas Instruments, removing or remarking the BATTERY.PRO
   line in the CONFIG.SYS file may cause the TI 4000 to over- heat. Contact TI
   Technical Support for more information.

 - Disable the GreenCache power management options in the CMOS setup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

BATTERY.PRO is the advanced power management (APM) utility for TI laptop
computers. It extends battery life when the laptop computer is not connected to
the docking station.
