======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your user name is greater than 15 characters and you start the basic
redirector, you are not logged on to the network; therefore, your persistent
connections are not restored. Although the basic redirector displays "The
command completed successfully," every subsequent NET command you use causes the
basic redirector to ask you for your user name and password. This problem occurs
because you were not logged on originally.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Use the full redirector.

   -or-

 - Shorten the length of your user name to 15 or fewer characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11 basic redirector. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you load the full redirector (Net Start Full), you can use user names up to
20 characters. If you use a user name greater than 20 characters, the following
error message is displayed:

   Error 7206: An incorrect user name was specified for the password-list file

Windows for Workgroups 3.11 does not allow you to enter more than 20 characters
for your user name when logging into the network.
