SUMMARY
=======

Instrument flight time is not added into the total for the flight in the
logbook.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two types of actual flight time: day and night. These are added
together to calculate the total time of the flight. Instrument flight time is a
separate measurement to determine the amount of time, day or night, spent flying
under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) only. Instrument time is totaled in the
logbook separately from day and night flight time.

Additional query words: flightsim fltsim dos 5.00 VFR FS5
