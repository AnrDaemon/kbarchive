TITLE   :DosReadMailslot Reads Incorrect Data Under Stress
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========


An application can fail because DosReadMailslot sometimes returns a message that
was not addressed to it. Generally this occurs when mailslot traffic is heavy.

CAUSE
=====

The code used when writing mailslot data to a local mailslot is not being marked
as busy early enough in the routine to keep other mailslot datagrams from
affecting the data.

RESOLUTION
==========

A fix for the LAN Manager MS-DOS redirector corrects this problem and is
available as CSD00.079.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in LAN Manager version 2.2. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 2.20 2.2 mailslot
