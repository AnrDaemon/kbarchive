SYMPTOMS
========

When text is displayed on a window with a background different than the
background of the DC (used to display the text), slivers will display between
the characters. The slivers seem to occur only between certain character
combinations, such as "Th".

This problem is only evident with some drivers, such as the standard VGA.

======
