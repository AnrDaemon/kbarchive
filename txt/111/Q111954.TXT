TITLE   :SMB Incorrectly Defined in Windows NT Resource Kit
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - MSPRESS Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows NT Resource Guide, Volume 1 of the Windows NT Resource Kit,
incorrectly defines the functionality of a Server Message Block (SMB) as it
pertains to networking architecture. On page 583, it states:

   The redirector packages SMB requests meant for remote computers in a
   structure known as a Network Control Block (NCB). NCBs can be sent over
   the network to a remote device.

In actuality, NCBs are never sent over the wire. Rather, SMBs are transmitted
over the physical media instead.

RESOLUTION
==========

The NCB functions as an intermediary between the redirector and the protocol
driver in Microsoft network architecture. Requests from the redirector sent down
the network stack to the protocol driver must first be registered as NCB
commands. Examples of NCB commands are ADD.NAME, CALL, RECEIVE, and SEND. Once
the commands are registered in the NCB, the redirector calls the protocol driver
and passes a pointer to the memory location of the NCB. The protocol driver can
then act on the data contained in the SMBs according to the instructions
contained in the NCB. The protocol driver then registers the results of the
completed redirector requests in the appropriate NCB field and returns program
control to the redirector.

The technical classification for an NCB is Interface Control Information, or ICI.
Interface Control Information functions completely within the layered
architecture of an individual protocol stack, and therefore this control
information itself never passes across the physical media of the network. The
SMB may be classified as a Protocol Data Unit (PDU) which ultimately is
transmitted across the physical network connection from one station to another.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Windows NT Resource Kit. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.
