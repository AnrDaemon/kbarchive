TITLE   :BUG: Gaps Between Wedges Drawn with Pie()
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain circumstances, the Windows Pie() API will leave gaps between pie
wedges when there should be a solid line.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Windows version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Pie() takes the following parameters:

      BOOL Pie( HDC hdc,
                int nLeftRect,
                int nTopRect,
                int nRightRect,
                int nBottomRect,
                int nxStartArc,
                int nyStartArc,
                int nxEndArc,
                int nyEndArc )

Pie() draws a pie-shaped wedge by drawing an elliptical arc whose center and two
endpoints are joined by lines.

Using Pie(), if two pie wedges are drawn with the same bounding rectangle and the
end point of the first wedge is equal to the start point of the second wedge,
there can be a gap between adjacent wedges. This gap shows up only with certain
pie sizes and certain start/end points.
