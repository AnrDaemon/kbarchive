TITLE   :BUG: Size of Owner-Draw Drop-Down Combo Box in Dialog Is Wrong
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly kbComboBox kbCtrl kbGrpDSUser kbOSWin310bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When creating an owner-draw drop-down combo box in a dialog box, the size of the
static portion is not the same as a non-owner-draw combo box in the same dialog
box. WM_MEASUREITEM is not being processed, and therefore the size of the
owner-draw combo box and non-owner-draw combo box should be the same.

CAUSE
=====

When creating a dialog box, the Dialog Manager determines how big the owner-
draw combo box should be based on the system font. If you specify a font in your
dialog box resource, this font should be used rather than the system font in
determining the size of the controls. Unfortunately, the Dialog Manager uses the
system font when determining the size of the static portion of an owner-draw
combo box, regardless of whether a different font has been specified in the
dialog box resource.

RESOLUTION
==========

To circumvent this problem, process the WM_MEASUREITEM message, specifying the
height of the items in your combo box. Windows correctly sizes the static
portion when you handle the WM_MEASUREITEM message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Windows version 3.1.
