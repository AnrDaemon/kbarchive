======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft C for MS-DOS 
 - Microsoft C/C++ for MS-DOS, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.51, 1.52 
 - Microsoft FORTRAN Compiler for MS-DOS 
 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 6.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you build an application in Microsoft C, Microsoft Visual C++, Microsoft
FORTRAN, Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation, or Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM),
one of the MS-DOS-extended development tools returns an unhandled exception
error message such as:

   run-time error R6915 -
   DOSX16: unhandled exception

-or-

   DOSXNT : fatal error DX1020: unhandled exception:
   Stack fault;
   contact Microsoft Support Services

-or-

   DOSXNT : fatal error DX1020: unhandled exception:
   General protection fault;
   contact Microsoft Support Services

-or-

   DOSXNT : fatal error DX1020: unhandled exception:
   Page fault;
   contact Microsoft Support Services

CAUSE
=====

Unhandled exception errors can be caused by a system configuration problem such
as an ill-behaved device driver, a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program, or
a memory manager that is not configured correctly for the hardware in a
particular machine.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make backups of both the CONFIG.SYS and the AUTOEXEC.BAT files. Edit your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files to remove all unnecessary device drivers and
TSRs. You can typically get by with a CONFIG.SYS file that contains only a
FILES= statement and a DEVICE=path\HIMEM.SYS. Depending on the hardware or
configuration of a particular machine, other device drivers might be required.
The AUTOEXEC.BAT file can contain a PATH statement and any required SET
statements, but should not invoke any programs.

After creating clean CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files, shut down and restart
your system. Try running the development tool that generated the unhandled
exception error from the MS-DOS prompt, without starting Windows or any other
programs. If at this point the problem goes away, substitute items back into
your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files until you can isolate which device driver
or TSR caused the problem. If the problem occurs under Windows but not MS-DOS,
try cleaning out your SYSTEM.INI file. If the problem does not go away, you will
want to consult the Microsoft knowledge base for other causes of the error.
