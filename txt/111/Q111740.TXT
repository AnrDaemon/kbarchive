KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

In the DoubleSpace maintenance program for MS-DOS 6.2, mouse functionality is not
available with the following commands:

   Compress Existing Drive

-and-

   Create New Drive

When you choose either of these commands, the mouse cursor disappears and input
is limited to the keyboard. In any further screens within either command, mouse
capability remains disabled unless another utility, such as ScanDisk or the
Defragmenter, is initiated. In such cases, the mouse promptly reappears. By
exiting the Compress Existing Drive or Create New Drive menu, mouse
functionality returns.

NOTE: In the MS-DOS 6.0 version of DBLSPACE.EXE, mouse functionality is available
with the Compress Existing Drive and Create New Drive commands, but keyboard
functionality is disabled.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The keys available in the Compress Existing Drive and Create New Drive menus are
