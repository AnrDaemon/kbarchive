SYMPTOMS
========

When you select the Land Me option, Land Me will either take control and land at
an airport other than the one desired, or display the following error message:

   Not close to any LAND ME airport

CAUSE
=====

Land Me is not available for all airports; it is available for selected airports
only. If the aircraft is within range of one of these airports (approximately 60
Nautical Miles) when the Land Me option is enabled, it will attempt to land at
that location. If the aircraft is not within range, you will receive the error
message shown above.
