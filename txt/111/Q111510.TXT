TITLE   :PRB: <ExpC3> of PUTFILE() Is Ignored in FoxPro for Macintosh
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.5b,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.5b 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are developing a cross-platform application and you include <expC3>
in the PUTFILE() function, it will be ignored in FoxPro for Macintosh.

For example, suppose you run the following code in both FoxPro for Windows and
FoxPro for Macintosh:

     ? PUTFILE('Choose a program file', 'test.prg', 'PRG')

In FoxPro for Windows, this code will create a dialog box that displays all files
with an extension of .PRG. In FoxPro for Macintosh, the same dialog box will
display all files in the current folder without filtering them by extension.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design due to the Macintosh standard of not relying on file
extensions for operations.
