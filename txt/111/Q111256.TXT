======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Installation of the Microsoft FoxPro Connectivity Kit should place an ODBC icon
in the Control Panel group, but sometimes this icon does not appear.

CAUSE
=====

The [MMCPL] section of the CONTROL.INI file does not contain the line:

      ODBC=C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\ODBCINST.DLL

RESOLUTION
==========

Reinstalling the Connectivity Kit should write this line to the CONTROL.INI
file. If the ODBC kit has been installed properly except for the icon, manually
adding this line to the CONTROL.INI file (which is located in the Windows
directory) will cause the icon to appear.

Additional query words: FoxWin 2.50 CK
