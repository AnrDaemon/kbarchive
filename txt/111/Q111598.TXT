SYMPTOMS
========

When a TrueType font is rotated, the text background is too small to completely
enclose the glyphs; the same text unrotated is enclosed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Windows version 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can reproduce this problem by running the FONTTEST sample, selecting Arial
72 pt, setting the lfEscapement to 450, and typing in "ff" in the String window.
Note how the upper-right part of the "f" goes outside the background rectangle.
