TITLE   :WFWG 3.11 Resource Kit Err Msg: THREED.VBX Is Out of Date
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start some of the utilities that come with the Windows for Workgroups
Resource Kit version 3.11, the following error message is displayed:

   The file THREED.VBX is out of date. This program requires a newer version.

CAUSE
=====

This error message is displayed because an older version of THREED.VBX is on the
hard disk drive and still in memory. Some of the utilities in the Resource Kit
use the file THREED.VBX to display 3-dimensional controls. Other third party
applications also use THREED.VBX, so this may occur even though the Resource Kit
is not installed on the machine.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, search the hard disk drive for any THREED.VBX files
that are not 64,544 in size and delete them. The correct THREED.VBX, which is
installed by the Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit, should be located in the
Windows SYSTEM subdirectory. The file date should be the date that the Windows
for Workgroups 3.11 Resource Kit utilities were installed on the machine.

After you delete any THREED.VBX files that are not 64,544 in size, exit and
reenter Windows for Workgroups.

If there is not a THREED.VBX file with the size 64,544, you should expand this
file from the Resource Kit disk by using the EXPAND.EXE utility. To expand
THREED.VB_ from the Resource Kit disk, type the following from the Windows
directory at an MS-DOS command prompt

   expand <a>:\mail\threed.vb_ <c>:\windows\system\threed.vbx

where <a> is the floppy disk drive containing the Resource Kit disk,
<c> is your hard disk drive, and <windows\system> is your Windows
SYSTEM subdirectory.
