TITLE   :Stacker Conversion: Your Computer Is Running Stacker...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Stacker Conversion utility for MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2, you may
receive the following error message:

   Your computer is running Stacker. DoubleSpace cannot convert Stacker volumes
   to DoubleSpace format while STACKER.COM is in memory. To convert your Stacker
   volumes, remove all Stacker commands from your CONFIG.SYS file, restart your
   computer, and run DoubleSpace again.

CAUSE
=====

This message occurs when the Stacker Conversion utility detects DBLSPACE.BIN in
memory at the same time as STACKER.COM. The two drivers should not be in memory
at the same time. This problem can occur if STACKER.COM is loading in the
CONFIG.SYS file and the DBLSPACE.INI file is located in the root directory of
the boot drive, causing DBLSPACE.BIN to remain in memory at startup.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can prevent DBLSPACE.BIN from loading in memory by renaming the file
DBLSPACE.INI. The steps below outline this procedure.

1. Change to the root directory of the boot (uncompressed) drive and locate the
   file DBLSPACE.INI.

2. Remove the file attributes from the DBLSPACE.INI file by typing "attrib
   dblspace.ini -s -h -r" (without the quotation marks).

3. Rename the file by typing "ren dblspace.ini dblspace.inx" (without the
   quotation marks).

4. Restart the computer (with the Stacker driver(s) loading in the CONFIG.SYS
   file), and run the Stacker Conversion utility again.
