-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Normally, the StretchBlt() function performs a palette translation when the
destination and source bitmaps do not contain the same color format or palette.
When the destination rectangle is the exact size of the source rectangle (no
stretching is performed), the palette translation is not performed.

CAUSE
=====

When the destination and source rectangles are the same size, no stretching is
performed and BitBlt() is called to perform a straight copy of the source to the
destination. BitBlt() does not perform the palette translation that StretchBlt()
does.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can force StretchBlt() to not call BitBlt() by changing one of the
destination rectangle coordinates by one unit. Then, the palette translation
will be performed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem does not occur in Windows NT version 3.1.
