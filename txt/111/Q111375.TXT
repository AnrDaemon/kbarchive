SUMMARY
=======

Page 90 of the Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer version 1.0 "Developer's

instructions, when you select the check box in the Read form, the following
error message appears:

   Out of Stack Space

Both the mouse event and the code provided on page 90 are incorrect. The Click
event should be MouseUp and the code should be replaced with the following:

      If gUnpackaging = False Then
    
         If chkTest.Value = True Then
            chkTest.Value = False
         Else
            chkTest.Value = True
         End If
    
      End If
