SUMMARY
=======

When you are copying a FoxPro database to a comma-delimited file using the COPY
TO <filename> TYPE DELIMITED command, the trailing blanks of each field
are removed. Occasionally, the entire file, including any trailing blanks found
in a field, needs to be copied to an ASCII file, but no options exist for the
COPY TO command to accomplish this. However, you can use low-level file
functions to transport the entire contents of every field from a database into a
comma-delimited ASCII file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code uses low-level file functions to read the CLIENTS.DBF sample
database file and place the characters and trailing blanks of each field in a
comma-delimited ASCII file named TEST.TXT:

      USE C:\Foxprow\Sample\Organize\dbfs\clients.dbf
      HFILE=FCREATE('c:\Test.txt')
      GO TOP
      SCAN
      =FPUTS(HFILE,Client_id+","+Company+","+Contact+","+Address+;
      ","+City+","+State+","+Zip+","+Areacode+","+Phone+","+Extension;
      +","+STR(startbal,8,2)+","+DTOC(Baldate)+Cuisine+","+STR(Type)+",";
      +Notes)
      ENDSCAN
      =FCLOSE(HFILE)

NOTE: By default, the FPUTS() function expects character type data in the fields.
Therefore, in order to use numeric and date fields, add the STR() and DTOC()
functions to convert the respective fields to character type data. Adding
additional parameters to the STR() function preserves the decimal places in the
numeric fields.
