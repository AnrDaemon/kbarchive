-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using MoveTo() or LineTo() with a delta X or delta Y greater than 16K to draw
within a complex clipping region, causes the system to display the following
error message in a system modal dialog box appears:

   Application Error integer divide by 0

CAUSE
=====

If the change in x or the change in y in the MoveTo/LineTo calls is greater than
16K, and if the line is being drawn to a complex clipping region, a divide
overflow error occurs in GDI.exe. This problem does not occur for smaller
changes in x or y, and it also does not occur if the line is being drawn to a
noncomplex clipping region.

RESOLUTION
==========

This bug can be worked around by avoiding complex clipping regions, or if
complex regions are critical, by ensuring that the changes in x and y in
MoveTo/LineTo calls are always less than 16K.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Windows version 3.1.
