The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Mail Gateway to SMTP may send outgoing mail with attachment names that have
changed case. This may be a problem for hosts with case-sensitive filenames.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The attachment names are changed to upper case from Mail for Windows. When you
compose a message and choose the Attach button, you see a list of files to pick
from in lower case. Once you pick one and it shows up in the message, the name
is in upper case. After the SMTP gateway delivers the message, it is still in
upper case.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can use the Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation. If you type the
filename of the attachment, the case is preserved through the SMTP gateway.
