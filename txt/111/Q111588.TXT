TITLE   :BUG: OpenFile() Doesn't Handle Forward Slash ("/") Character
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

OpenFile() does not correctly handle paths beginning with a forward slash
character ("/") (for example, as in "x:/").

CAUSE
=====

The forward slash character "/" is put into the normalized name as is, instead
of being converted to a backslash character ("\"). OpenFile() is not implemented
to check for the forward slash character.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Windows version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
