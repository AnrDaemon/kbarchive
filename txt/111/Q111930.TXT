The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After you connect to a Remote Access Services (RAS) server under Windows for
Workgroups 3.11, connections to other machines on the remote network are not
possible.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 3.11 RAS Server
-----------------------

The Windows for Workgroups 3.11 RAS server allows a point-to-point connection
only. Therefore, the RAS client can use only resources local to the RAS
server--no other network access is provided. This is a product security feature
implemented because Windows for Workgroups 3.11 provides share-level, not
user-level, security.

Windows NT, Windows NT Advanced Server, or LAN Manager RAS Server
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Connecting to a Windows NT, Windows NT Advanced Server, or LAN Manager RAS server
allows access to the entire network provided that user rights have been granted
to those network resources and that the RAS Gateway has been configured
correctly.

Windows NT, Windows NT Advanced Server, and LAN Manager, unlike Windows for
Workgroups 3.11, provide user-level security; therefore, the user must be
granted specific rights to network resources before the user can use or view
them. For information on configuring user rights, consult your Windows NT,
Windows NT Advanced Server, or LAN Manager documentation; your system
administrator; or Microsoft Product Support for Windows NT, Windows NT Advanced
Server, or LAN Manager.

Additional query words: 3.11 NT AS
