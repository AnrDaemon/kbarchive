SUMMARY
=======

FoxPro for MS-DOS allows the user to place libraries into a project as as an
INCLUDE file, but FoxPro for Macintosh automatically excludes libraries that are
added. However, FoxPro for MS-DOS projects will typically build without error in
FoxPro for Macintosh.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a project containing an included library is brought from MS-DOS to the
Macintosh, the project will build without error if the library filename includes
a .PLB extension. If the default extension was not used, an "API Library not
found" error message will result. In Visual FoxPro, the error is "API Library is
not found."
