TITLE   :BUG: _lread() Functions Incorrectly When No Floppy in Drive
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the function _lread() to read a floppy disk when there is no disk in the
floppy drive results in the System error-message box "Cannot Read from Drive..."
with Retry and Cancel buttons. If the Cancel button is clicked, _lread()
returns, indicating incorrectly that it read the number of bytes requested.
Instead, it should return -1, indicating failure.

RESOLUTION
==========

Before calling _lread(), call SetErrorMode() in your application to disable the
default Windows Critical Error Handler so that the system error-message box will
not be displayed. The _lread() function will correctly return -1, indicating
failure.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Windows version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
