TITLE   :BUG: Dr. Watson Fails to Write Log File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Assume that the drive for the Windows directory is substituted using the MS- DOS
SUBST command. For example:

   subst w: c:\win31

Under this condition, Dr. Watson fails to write to its log file, either the
default DRWATSON.LOG or any other changed log filename. In fact, when the Dr.
Watson icon is double-clicked, the message box that follows shows the log
filename as W:\\DRWATSON.LOG, which is incorrect.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Windows version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
