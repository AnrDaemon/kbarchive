The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows for Workgroups 3.11 on a Zenith computer using the
Zenith-provided ODI drivers for the bundled SMC Ethercard, you receive the
following error message:

   Error 58: The network has responded incorrectly

CAUSE
=====

The Zenith-provided version of the ODI driver is named ZECODI. If the SMC
Ethercard multiple link interface device (MLID) was installed after Windows for
Workgroups was set up, the Bindings= lines in the PROTOCOL.INI file are written
incorrectly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, edit the PROTOCOL.INI file by replacing any instances
of SMC8000 with ZECODI in the Bindings= lines.

Zenith Technical Support recommends that customers use the drivers that ship with
their versions of the network card. Since there is no OEMSETUP.INF file, users
are directed to install the card as the SMC Ethercard Plus. If the MLID is
running before you set up Windows for Workgroups, the Bindings= lines are
written correctly. Windows for Workgroups pulls the MLID name from LSL if the
MLID is running.
