SUMMARY
=======

When you run the Windows NT Resource Kit repair utility to save emergency repair
information for a computer, you will be prompted to insert your original
Emergency Repair Disk so it can be updated. If you do not have your original
Emergency Repair Disk or you do not want to update it and you are running the
utility on a RISC-based computer, you can bypass this by pressing ENTER or
choosing the Ignore button.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you run REPAIR.EXE, the /S option creates a repair directory that contains
information that will be used to generate an Emergency Repair Disk. If you run
repair with the /S switch only, it always assumes you want to update your
current Emergency Repair Disk and it prompts you for the disk. On 80x86-based
computers, pressing the ENTER key at this point bypasses this step and starts
creating the repair directory. On RISC-based computers, such as the DEC Alpha
and the MIPS R400, after you press ENTER, a dialog box with the option to Abort,
Retry, or Ignore appears; choose the Ignore button.

If you also use the /X switch in addition to /S (for example, REPAIR /S /X), it
does not assume you are updating an old Emergency Repair Disk and immediately
starts creating the repair directory.
