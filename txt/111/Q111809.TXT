SUMMARY
=======

The SROWS() and SCOLS() functions return different values in FoxPro for
Macintosh depending on the setting of MACDESKTOP.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Macintosh interface does not require applications to have a controlling
application window the way Windows does. In FoxPro for Windows, SROWS() and
SCOLS() return a value based on the size of the FoxPro application window. Since
this relationship does not exist on the Macintosh, varying results will occur
depending on the setting of MACDESKTOP.

For example, issue the following commands in FoxPro for Macintosh:

      SET MACDESKTOP ON
      ?SROWS()
      ?SCOLS()
      SET MACDESKTOP OFF
      ?SROWS()
      ?SCOLS()

With MACDESKTOP set to ON, the value is based on the overall screen width. With
MACDESKTOP set to OFF, the value is based on the main FoxPro screen.
