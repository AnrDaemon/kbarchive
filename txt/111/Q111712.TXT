TITLE   :WFWG 3.11: 3C509 MLID May Cause Lost Connections and Hangs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the 3COM EtherLink III (3C509) network interface card (NIC) and the
3COM ODI MLID (3C509.COM or 3C5x9.COM) with Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
and Novell NetWare is installed as your secondary network, you may encounter the
following problems:

 - Copying large blocks of data across the network cause the computer to stop
   responding (hang).

 - The computer inadvertently loses network connections.

CAUSE
=====

The 3C509 NIC has a 4-kilobyte (K) FIFO buffer. This allows 2K to receive and 2K
to transmit. If more information than this is passed through the card at one
time, that information is lost.


In addition, the 3C509 uses approximately 88 percent of the CPU's resources when
it is transmitting.

RESOLUTION
==========

As a temporary workaround for this problem, try one of the following:

 - Use the IPX Monolithic driver.

   -or-

 - Use only the NDIS 3 drivers that ship with Windows for Workgroups 3.11.

   -or-

 - Use NetBEUI as your only protocol.

   -or-

 - With the "IPX/SPX Compatible Transport with NetBIOS" set as the default
   protocol, place the following setting in the [Networks] section of the
   SYSTEM.INI file:

         [Networks]
         SlowLANAs=0

   -or-

 - If you installed Windows for Workgroups 3.11 over Windows for Workgroups
   version 3.1, use the MSIPX protocol from Windows for Workgroups 3.1.
