TITLE   :Errors on Token Ring Network with Banyan Vines 5.52 and WFWG
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows for Workgroups adds NDISBAN.COM to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. If you have a
token ring configuration, this entry causes the following errors to occur when
you start your system:

 - Vines NDIS interface error 1010- NDISBAN.DOC

   -and-

 - Error 5739 the Protocol Manager has reported an incompatible MAC driver

CAUSE
=====

Banyan VINES version 5.52 (rev.5) uses NDTOKBAN.COM instead of NDISBAN.COM for
NDIS token ring support. If you have the wrong file (NDISBAN.COM) in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file, the errors occur. The errors also occur if you have both
files in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, remove NDISBAN.COM from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups version
3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
