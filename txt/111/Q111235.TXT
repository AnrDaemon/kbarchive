TITLE   :BUG: D2030 or DX1020 Error on Assumed-Size Array Expressions
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Compiling a file that contains an assumed-size array expression may produce the
following error under Windows NT:

   Command Line Error D2030: INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR

Under straight MS-DOS, the following error may be produced during compilation:

   DOSXNT : fatal error DX1020: unhandled exception: Page fault;

Under the Windows MS-DOS box, no error is produced. The appropriate errors for
this situation are:

   error F2652: array expression: cannot be assumed-size array

   error F2564: incompatible types in assignment

CAUSE
=====

Because the size of an assumed-sized array is not known at compile time, you
cannot use an assumed-size array in an array expression.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not use assumed-size arrays in array expressions.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation 32 for
Windows NT version 1.0 and MS-DOS version 1.0 and 1.0a. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample illustrates the problem:

Sample Code
-----------

   c Compile options needed: none
   c
         INTEGER*2 FUNCTION GETSP(SPVALU)
         INTEGER*2       COMBUF
         INTEGER*2       SPVALU(*)
         SPVALU = COMBUF  !  Array expression sets each element to COMBUF
         END

Additional query words: 1.00 1.00a ICE array operations
