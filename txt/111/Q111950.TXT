SUMMARY
=======

The tag in CMS is the location where the destination USER and NODE information
are held. By using the TAG FILE command, this information can be inserted into
an empty tag. (Tag information is the Destination information associated with a
particular CMS message or file, for example, destination USER and NODE).

Usually this process is used when testing the response of Host Access for mail
addressed to a particular NODE or USER. The command line is:

   TAG FILE rdr_number NEW_NODE NEW_USER

where NEW_NODE and NEW_USER are the respective Node and User information the Tag
the file with.

NOTE: The rdr_number is obtained by typing Q RDR ALL at the CMS prompt.
