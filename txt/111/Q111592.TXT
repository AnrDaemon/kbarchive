TITLE   :BUG: DeleteObject() Generates Debug Errors in WEP
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Freeing GDI objects in the Windows Exit Procedure (WEP) of a dynamic-link
library (DLL) will generate errors from the debug version of Windows 3.1. The
errors are incorrectly generated if the application has an implicit link to the
DLL and the application is terminating.

CAUSE
=====

The debug version of Windows reports errors that a task has exited but has not
freed any GDI resources allocated by the task. Windows calls the WEP of an
implicitly linked DLL when the DLL is unloaded from memory but after the
application using the DLL has already exited. Debug Windows interprets this
situation as an error and gives debug messages in DBWIN or the debug terminal.

RESOLUTION
==========

Although debug Windows reports the GDI objects are not freed, The WEP is still
called and the objects are still freed regardless of the messages displayed by
debug Windows. There is no need to call DeleteObject(). These messages can be
ignored.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Windows version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
