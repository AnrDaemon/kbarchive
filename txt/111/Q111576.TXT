TITLE   :BUG: LineTo() Endcaps Misaligned with Large Pen Width
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If LineTo() is used with a wide pen selected, the endcaps are misaligned with
the line; they are skewed at an angle relative to the line.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Windows version 3.0 and 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To reproduce the problem, select a black pen of width about 100:

   MoveTo(hDC,207,73)
   LineTo(hDC,512,251)

Look at the endcaps; they cause the line to appear twisted or deformed.

NOTE: To invalidate the area, the following was used:

   Rect.top=Y1-nCurPenWidth/2-1
   Rect.left=X1-nCurPenWidth/2-1
   Rect.bottom=Y2+nCurPenWidth/2+1
   Rect.right=X2+nCurPenWidth/2+1

If nCurPenWidth is greater than 103, then the endcaps are not completely erased,
and fall outside the Rect area.

Additional query words: buglist3.00 buglist3.10 3.00 3.10 end caps
