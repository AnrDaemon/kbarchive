SUMMARY
=======

The correct way to test a CString to see whether it is empty (or not empty) is
to use the IsEmpty() member function as shown below:

      CString x = "This is a sample CString";
      if (x.IsEmpty())
         AfxMessageBox("The CString is EMPTY");
      else
         AfxMessageBox("The CString is not EMPTY");

MORE INFORMATION
================

The CString member function IsEmpty() tests a CString for the empty condition.
The function returns nonzero if the string has zero length.

If the CString equality operators (==, !=) are used in an attempt to test whether
a CString is NULL, a general protection (GP) fault may occur. The following code
fragment demonstrates this:

      CString x = "This is a sample CString";
      if (x != NULL)  // GP Fault for (x == NULL) condition, as well
         AfxMessageBox("The CString is not EMPTY");
      else
         AfxMessageBox("The CString is EMPTY");

Because x is a CString object, not a pointer, it is inappropriate to compare x to
a null pointer.

Testing a CString against the empty string, as shown below, is allowed. Because a
temporary CString object is constructed, this method is less efficient than
calling IsEmpty():

      CString x = "This is a sample CString";
      if (x != "")
         AfxMessageBox("The CString is not EMPTY");
      else
         AfxMessageBox("The CString is EMPTY");
