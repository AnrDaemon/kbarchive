The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows for Workgroups and configure it for the Proteon ISA
Token Ring (1346) or Proteon ISA Token Ring (1346) card, you receive the
following error after you restart your computer:

   M2052: Bad protocol.ini - Driver Name not found PRO4AT$.
   M2010: Driver conf error - Error when loading

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by incorrect settings in the PROTOCOL.INI file. The
PROTOCOL.INI file has the following section

      [MS$PRO1347]
      DriverName=PRO4$
      IRQ=<xx>

   -or-

      [MS$PRO1346]
      DriverName=PRO4$
      IRQ=<xx>

where <xx> is the IRQ value.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, edit the [MS$PRO1347] or [MS$PRO1346] section and
change the IRQ= entry to INtLevel=. For example

      [MS$PRO1347]
      DriverName=PRO4$
      INtLevel=<xx>

where <xx> is the IRQ value.
