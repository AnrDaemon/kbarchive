TITLE   :AWFAX Hangs When Faxing a Microsoft Works for Windows Document
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to send a Microsoft Works version 3.0 for Windows document using
Microsoft At Work PC Fax while Works for Windows is running, the machine stops
responding (hangs).

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Microsoft At Work PC Fax calls a ShellExecute
routine for the Microsoft Works for Windows document while Works for Windows is
still running. ShellExecute launches a new instance of Works for Windows and
returns this instance to Microsoft At Work PC Fax. The new instance of Works for
Windows discovers the previous instance and terminates after requesting that the
previous instance prints on its behalf. Microsoft At Work PC Fax waits for the
instance generated by ShellExecute to begin printing; therefore, the machine
hangs.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - If you want to send the document in facsimile format, use the print method
   (that is, choose Print from the File menu in Works for Windows and select the
   Microsoft At Work PC Fax printer driver).

   -or-

 - If you are attaching a Works for Windows document to a Microsoft Mail
   message, make sure that Works for Windows is not already running.
