SUMMARY
=======

The GETFILE() and PUTFILE() functions in FoxPro for Macintosh return strings in
uppercase.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On the Macintosh, filenames can be created in lowercase and uppercase. You can
also use mixed case for filenames when you are working interactively with all
the FoxPro power tools. However, under program control, the PUTFILE() function
is used to allow a filename to be entered. Even if a mixed case filename is
entered, the PUTFILE() function returns the string in all uppercase.

Likewise, the GETFILE() function returns the path and filename in uppercase
regardless of the filename's actual case.

Additional query words: VFoxMac FoxMac Upper lower case
