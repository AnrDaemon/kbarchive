======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade to Windows NT, some of your MS-DOS batch files may fail to
work as expected. This is due to how the SET command's functionality has
changed. Under MS-DOS, the SET command did not reset the error level, enabling
you to SET variables and handle error levels later in your batch files. This
problem also exists in the following batch file commands: PATH, DPATH, and
PROMPT.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Windows NT Server version 3.5. This problem was corrected in the latest U.S.
Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.5. For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
