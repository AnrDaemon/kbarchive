TITLE   :WFWG Error Msg: This Postoffice Cannot Be Updated
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Extensions for Windows for Workgroups or the
Microsoft Mail Update program, you may receive the following error message:

   This post office cannot be updated. Consult Microsoft Product Support
   Services for more information.

CAUSE
=====

There are two possible causes for this error:

 - You are running the Extend utility on a server post office. Extend can be run
   only on a workgroup post office (WGPO).

   If the post office is not a workgroup post office, you do not need to run the
   Extend utility. The Extend utility is designed for Windows for Workgroups
   workgroup post offices to extend them to the functionality of a full
   Microsoft Mail post office.

 - You are trying to run the Microsoft Mail Update program on a workgroup post
   office without first running the Extend utility.

   If you run the Update program without first running the Extend utility, or if
   you do not have a valid Microsoft Mail post office, you receive the above
   error. If you do not have Windows for Workgroups and have not yet created a
   Microsoft Mail post office, you must run the Install program instead of the
   Update program. If you have any existing Microsoft Mail post offices, you
   should run the Update utility to add the features of the new version of
   Microsoft Mail while retaining the definitions of the older post office.
