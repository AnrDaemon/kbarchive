TITLE   :BUG: Pie() and Arc() Functions Fail with a Wide Pen
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When creating a wide (multiple pixel) pen and drawing a reasonably large object,
the drawing function returns 0 (zero) or does not draw anything. Choosing a thin
(single pixel) pen or choosing a pen smaller than X pixels corrects the problem.

CAUSE
=====

GDI builds a polygon that basically puts a circle on every point along the pen's
path and calls Polygon() to fill it. If the point data or the working storage of
Polygon() exceeds 64K, the call is failed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Windows version 3.0 and 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are examples that reproduce the problems in Windows version 3.1.

Pie() Function
--------------

When selecting a bold pen [second parameter of CreatePen() is greater than 7] and
calling Pie() as follows, nothing is drawn; however, the return value of Pie()
indicates that it was drawn:

   hPen=CreatePen(PS_SOLID,9,0L);
   SelectObject(hDC,hPen);
   Pie(hDC, 96, 11, 839, 754, 440, 12, 479, 11);

Arc() Function
--------------

The Arc() function returns an error value when called as follows, even though the
width and height are both within the documented limits of 32767:

   Arc( hDC, -11047, -3493, 806, 8360, 311, 64, 356, 170 );
                x1      y1   x2    y2   X3  Y3   X4   Y4
