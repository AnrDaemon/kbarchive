KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows for Workgroups 3.11 automatic detection incorrectly identifies the
Artisoft NodeRunner network adapter.

CAUSE
=====

The NodeRunner network card works correctly with Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups when it is configured as an NE2000-compatible card. The Artisoft
NodeRunner network adapter card is self-configuring. Sometimes Windows for
Workgroups detection does not properly recognize the card as being NE2000
compatible.

WORKAROUND
==========

If this occurs, manually select the NE2000-compatible network card when you are
setting up the network. This should allow the card to switch to NE2000-
compatibility mode. If problems still exists, use the NodeRunner 2000
NRCONFIG.EXE or NRSETUP.EXE program to reconfigure the card.

For Windows 95, use the NRCONFIG.EXE tool to set the adapter to NE2000 or NE1000
mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
