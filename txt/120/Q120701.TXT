-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Space Simulator for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If the SETUP.EXE program for Space Simulator is run from any active drive other
than drive A or B, Setup will not copy any files to the hard disk.

For example, typing "a:\setup" (without the quotation marks) at the C:\ MS-DOS
prompt will not perform a complete setup because drive C is the active drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SETUP.EXE file will operate in one of two modes depending on the conditions
it detects. If Setup detects that the active drive is either the floppy drive A
or B, it will perform a complete installation, including creating the necessary
directory, copying all files to the disk, and configuring the program. If Setup
detects that the active drive is not drive A or B, it will operate in a
configuration mode, bypassing the directory creation and file copy, and will
only perform the configuration portion of the Setup process.
