======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

The VUDP.386 driver is not copied to the hard disk during installation, although
it is on the installation disk of the released version of Microsoft TCP/IP-32
for Windows for Workgroups 3.11 (file size and date 15838 and 08-10-94,
respectively).

MORE INFORMATION
================

This file isn't copied because it isn't needed; VTCP.386 includes all the
functionality of UDP within it. VUDP.386 is included on the disk because if you
want a Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 computer to be a router only, with a
UDP driver but no TCP driver, you can install this file instead of VTCP.386.

Additional query words: prodtcp32 wfw wfwg 3.11
