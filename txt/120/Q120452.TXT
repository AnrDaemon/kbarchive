KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Sound System, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to open the Microsoft Windows Sound System Audio Control icon, the
following error message is displayed:

   Invalid Machine ID

CAUSE
=====

Toshiba uses a subset of the Windows Sound System that is coded to identify
Toshiba systems. This subset is meant to function on Toshiba systems with
integrated audio only. If it is installed in a non-Toshiba system, the subset
loads correctly but generates the above error when you open the Audio Control
icon.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem may also occur on other systems that include subsets of Windows
Sound System not specifically designed for those particular systems.
