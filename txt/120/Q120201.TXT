SYMPTOMS
========

When you dial a Remote Access Services (RAS) server, the connection is not
established, and the following error message is displayed:

   Error Communicating with Server

   Error 717: Serial Overrun Errors were detected Communicating with your Modem.

Help suggests lowering the bits-per-second (BPS) rate. Although this eliminates
the error message, it prevents you from using the full capabilities of your
high-speed modem.

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs when a high-speed modem with a 16550 UART chip is
being used and the COMxFIFO= setting for the corresponding communications (COM)
port is set to 0 (zero). The COMxFIFO= entry default is normally 1.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, manually edit the SYSTEM.INI file and change the
COMxFIFO= setting (where x is the COM port the modem is on) in the [386Enh]
section to 1.

Additional query words: 3.11 over run zero com1fifo com2fifo com3fifo com4fifo
