The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

If you have Micron Powerstation or Powerserver with Buslogic's BT-946C SCSI
controller, Windows NT setup may hang without an error message while attempting
to load Windows NT to complete the graphic portion of Setup.


MORE INFORMATION
================

According to Micron and Buslogic these steps usually solve the problem:

1. Press CTRL-B to go to Buslogic Auto Configuration.

2. Select Configure Device Menu.

3. Select Disconnection Option.

4. Set "Disconnection on all ID's except 0 and 1" to YES.

5. If these were already set this way you may need to toggle them, because some
   hard drives do not support disconnection.

Buslogic Product Support does not recommend permanently changing the controller
configuration as indicated above unless there is only one SCSI device attached
to the controller. The procedure may disable the functionality of SCSI devices
on the SCSI chain during certain I/O actions carried out by the OS.

If there are no scanning devices on this chain it is possible to Disable the SCAN
MODE option, since this can cause problems with the installation of NT,
according to Buslogic.

If this does not solve the problem, go to the Buslogic Auto Configuration and
verify that the IRQ pin is set to pin A (the default) on the Powerstations and
Powerservers. On P90 models this should be set to pin C (the default); the
adapter is installed next to the power supply. Then verify that the IRQ being
used is set to 15 and that in the "Advanced Options" the BIOS is set to use
4D8.

Additionally Buslogic BIOS should be flashed to the most recent version (1.40E as
of 9/4/96) since this solves most setup or operational problems related to NT
3.51 and NT 4.0.

These steps solve most of the setup hang problems with Windows NT. You can get
