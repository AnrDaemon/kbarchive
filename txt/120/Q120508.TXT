SUMMARY
=======

The Windows Palette Manager (an integral part of GDI) was designed specifically
for 8-bit display adapters with a hardware palette of 256 entries.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Every pixel on the screen is stored as an 8-bit index in the hardware palette.
Images created with a color depth of 16 or 24 bits (32K and 16 million colors)
do not use palettes and control the video output directly. Therefore, the design
of the Windows Palette Manager designates 256 colors as the maximum number
allowed for any palette. It is not possible to make different images with
greater than 256 colors share a common palette; however, it is possible to
reduce the images to 256 colors and then create a common palette for these
images.
