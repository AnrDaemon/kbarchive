PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Changes made to the Windows In Foreground setting in the Enhanced dialog box of
Control Panel do not take effect after restarting Windows. Control Panel shows
different values from those specified for the WinTimeslice= entry of the
[386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the Performance Priority setting in the Startup
Settings dialog box of Control Panel (accessed by choosing the Network icon and
then the Startup button) is set to Resources Shared Fastest or a value too high
(that is, too close to the Resources Shared Fastest end).

RESOLUTION
==========

Move the Performance Priority indicator toward the Applications Run Fastest end.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
