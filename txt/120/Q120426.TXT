The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run the PowerSoft PowerBuilder Watcom database engine DB32W.EXE in a
separate VDM, a General Protection Fault (GPF) occurs when another application
tries to access the database through DB32W.EXE. In tests with Microsoft Query,
the GPF occurred in <unknown> at 00C7:B40A.

CAUSE
=====

When another application sets up ODBC, PowerBuilder's DB32W.EXE passes it a
16:16 pointer what is valid only in the VDM where DB32W.EXE is running.

RESOLUTION
==========

DB32W.EXE will run in a separate VDM if you check the Run In Separate Memory
Space box in the Program Item Properties dialog box in Program Manager. It will
also run in a separate VDM if you launch it with the START command. Run the
querying application and DB32W.EXE in the same VDM.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

Additional query words: prodnt memory violation
