The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to select and delete a group of static mappings from the Static
Mappings dialog box from Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) Manager, only a
subset of the selected mappings are deleted. This problem occurs when a
selection spans more than one page (80 entries).

WORKAROUND
==========

Choose OK and then select and delete the remaining static mappings.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Windows NT Server version 3.50. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
