======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Microsoft Backup for Windows (MWBACKUP.EXE), you receive the
following error message as Microsoft Backup is reading directories:

   There are too many files in the current directory. Not all the files will be
   available for backup.

If you choose OK, Backup continues to load; however, some of the files from the
given directory are not available for backup.

CAUSE
=====

This error message is displayed if one (or more) of the directories on the drive
being read contains more than 1637 files.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

 - Move some of the files from the original directory into a new directory so
   that the total number of files in the original directory is not greater than
   1637.

 - Quit Windows and run Microsoft Backup for MS-DOS (MSBACKUP.EXE) by typing
   "msbackup" (without the quotation marks) at an MS-DOS command prompt. If
   MSBACKUP.EXE is not installed, you can install it by running SETUP /E from
   the MS-DOS Setup Disk 1.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
