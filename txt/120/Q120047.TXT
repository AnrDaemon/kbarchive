SUMMARY
=======

Notes in the Access 2.0 Help section on "Installing ODBC Drivers and Setting up
Data Sources," incorrectly state that an ODBC group and ODBC Admin icon are
created when you install ODBC. No group or icon is created under Windows NT.

The ODBC Admin file (ODBCADM.EXE) is located in the \SYSTEM subdirectory of your
Windows NT directory. Use the path <winnt>\SYSTEM to create an ODBC group
or icon manually.

Additional query words: prodnt 3.10 MSACCESS
