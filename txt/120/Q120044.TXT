PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbBug kbISS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG# SQLDBASE: 2131 (1.01.1928)

SYMPTOMS
========

Calling SQLGetInfo with InfoType=SQL_NON_NULLABLE_COLUMNS for Microsoft Access
ODBC driver returns the value as SQL_NNC_NON_NULL, which implies that the
columns may be non-nullable and that the data source supports the NOT NULL
column constraint in CREATE TABLE statement. However, the Microsoft Access ODBC
driver does not allow NON NULL constraint in the CREATE TABLE. Therefore, the
value returned should be SQL_NNC_NULL to indicate that all columns must be
nullable.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Access ODBC driver version
1.01.1908. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
