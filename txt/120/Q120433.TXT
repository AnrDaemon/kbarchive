The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you print from Adobe Photoshop, the screen image covered by the Print
dialog box does not redraw completely if you used the Printer Setup dialog box
before printing. Under Windows 3.x, the redraw is incomplete only the first time
the image is printed; under Windows NT 3.5, it is incomplete every time.


WORKAROUND
==========

Minimize, then restore the image window.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
