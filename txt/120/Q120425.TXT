The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the Microsoft C/C++ 7.0a Windows SDK, this message appears:

   Unable to find Windows in the specified directory.

when you choose the Windows NT directory or any directory under it. The
installation proceeds if you press Enter to continue.

CAUSE
=====

The SDK installation utility needs to locate all of these files:

     \windows\system.ini
     \windows\progman.ini
     \windows\winver.exe
     \windows\system\gdi.exe
     \windows\system\user.exe

Windows NT places three of these in \SYSTEM32 instead of \SYSTEM and does not
have a PROGMAN.INI file. Because it does not find all of the files, the SDK
utility does not think it has found the Windows directory.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. No work around is necessary. The SDK files install
normally when you press ENTER to ignore the error message and continue the
installation.
