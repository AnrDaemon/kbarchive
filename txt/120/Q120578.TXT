TITLE   :Duplicate IP Addresses Not Detected Correctly
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Duplicate IP addresses are not handled properly by Microsoft TCP/IP-32. A newly
started computer using an already used IP address will join the network
successfully without correcting the duplication problem. Communication with
either of the computers sharing the IP address is not reliable. If the first
computer using the IP address has Microsoft TCP/IP- 32 or Windows NT 3.5, a
notification message appears, but no further error handling occurs.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft TCP/IP-32. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: prodtcp32 wfw wfwg 1.0 WFWG WOLVERINE
