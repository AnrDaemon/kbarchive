The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Removable storage media (for example, CD Juke Box or tapes) may be damaged or
get stuck in the drive or changer mechanism.

CAUSE
=====

In Windows NT 3.1, the Server Service periodically polls all drives for
available free space and logs an event if drive space is low.


On removable media drives, this polling can cause a conflict with the disk or
cartridge drive/changer. If the changer is ejecting the cartridge when a
periodic poll is received, the conflict may damage the tape or CD, or jam the
tape cartridge or CD in the unit.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this behavior Microsoft has modified the Windows NT Server Service
(SRVSVC.DLL) to only poll fixed disks. Removable media, CD-ROMs, and RAM disks
are not polled. The new Server Service no longer creates an x$ administrative
share (where "x" is the media drive letter) for removable media drives.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem has been corrected in Windows NT
Workstation and Windows NT Server version 3.5. This problem has also been
corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced
Server version 3.1. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
