   APPEND GENERAL <fieldname>

STATUS

the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

Type the following commands in the Command window:

      CREATE TABLE test (genfld G, charfld C(10))
      INSERT INTO test (charfld) VALUES ('ONE')
      APPEND GENERAL genfld

Note that no error message is generated.

NOTE: If the INSERT command is not run, an "End of file encountered" error
message is displayed. This error occurs when the APPEND GENERAL command is used
with an empty table.

table, please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
