======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, 16-bit edition, versions 1.0, 1.5 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 1.0, 2.0, 4.1, 4.2, 5.0, 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++.NET (2002) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Trigraphs are three-character sequences used to represent punctuation
unavailable in a character set. When the compiler encounters Trigraph statements
that use ifdef and endif statements, it gives the following erroneous
end-of-file error:

   fatal error C1004: unexpected end of file found.

CAUSE
=====

Trigraph translation is not finished before processing, so the #endif (the
equivalent of ??=endif) is not reached.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

NOTE: This problem did not occur in Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, version
4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is sample code to reproduce the problem:

      /* Compile options needed: none
      */ 

      ??=ifdef TESTING
      int i=0;
      ??=endif
