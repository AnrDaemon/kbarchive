PRODUCT :Miscellaneous Windows Products
PROD/VER::2.0; WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:mnk

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Sound System, version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Natural Keyboard with IntelliType software, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft IntelliPoint software, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to run Microsoft IntelliType or IntelliPoint software with the
ProofReader utility that ships with the Microsoft Windows Sound System, the
following error is displayed:

   The Sound Input Is Busy

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when two input devices attempt to use the sound device at
the same time. The above error can be generated in the Windows Sound System
ProofReader under the following conditions:

 - The IntelliType software is installed and you have enabled sounds for
   keyboard activities, and you have chosen the On Entry command in the
   ProofReader.

   -or-

 - The IntelliPoint software is installed and you have enabled sounds for mouse
   actions with the Microsoft Home or Standard Mouse, and you have chosen the
   Selected Range command in the ProofReader.

WORKAROUND
==========

 - If you are using IntelliType, open the Microsoft Natural Keyboard IntelliType
   Manager. Click the Keyboard Options tab and disable Sounds by selecting
   Sounds Off.

   -or-

 - If you are using IntelliPoint, open IntelliPoint Tools & Controls and
   disable the sound by clicking the Special Effects tab and selecting
   Unassigned under Scheme. As an alternative, you can remove the mouse action
   sound (.WAV file) that is causing the problem by selecting that particular
   mouse action and changing its action sound to None. Both of these techniques
   allow the Windows Sound System ProofReader to proofread selected ranges
   correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are using either IntelliType or IntelliPoint, the software generates a
warning when you first activate or change the sounds. These messages are listed
below.
