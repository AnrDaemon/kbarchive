TITLE   :PRB: Viewer Setup Error in INICM.C Line 185 or in PROGCM.C
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1; :2.0,2.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
 - Microsoft Multimedia Viewer Publishing Toolkit, versions 2.0, 2.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After creating the setup program for your Viewer title by following the
instructions in the Viewer Authoring Guide (Chapter 13, "Completing the
Package"), you test the setup by running SETUP.EXE. This results in the
following setup error message:

   Setup has encountered a problem.
   Please report File='INSTALL\INICM.C', Line='185' to
   Microsoft Product Support Services.

The error message may report a different file and a different line number, such
as:

   Please report File='INSTALL\PROGCM.C', Line='298' to
   Microsoft Product Support Services.
   Please report File='INSTALL\PROGCM.C', Line='468' to
   Microsoft Product Support Services.

CAUSE
=====

You must initialize the seven global variables before the setup will run
correctly. Invalid values in these variables cause the error messages:

 - An error occurs in INICM.C on line 185 occurs when the setup script calls the
   function CreateIniKeyValue if the MVBFileName$ variable is set to an empty
   string ("").

 - An error occurs in PROGCM.C on line 298 occurs when the setup script calls
   the function CreateProgmanGroup if the ProgmanGroup$ variable is set to an
   empty string ("").

 - An error occurs in PROGCM.C on line 468 when the setup script calls the
   function CreateProgmanItem if the ProgmanItem$ variable is set to an empty
   string ("").

RESOLUTION
==========

Fill in correct string values for all seven global variables near the top of the
TITLE.MST file. For information on how to correctly fill in these values, see
the "Completing the Package" chapter of the Authoring Guide, which contains a
section called "Customizing TITLE.MST." Follow these instructions, and read the
comments in the TITLE.MST file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Do not change the name of the TITLE.MST file. If you change the name of the
TITLE.MST file, you may get one of the following errors:

   Setup Initialization Error
   Setup cannot access required initialization file:
   '<path>\TITLE.MST'."

   -or-

   Microsoft Test Driver (dumb shell)
   Can't read the file 'title.mst'"
