TITLE   :Scenes 2.0: SPACEBAR plus ENTER Causes GP Fault
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Scenes (all collections), version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Scenes 2.0 may generate the following error message when you hold down the
SPACEBAR and press ENTER to edit a collection in the "Edit an existing
collection" Wizard:

   Application Error: SCENES caused a General Protection Fault in module
   MSSCMN.DLL at 0004:7CB4.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Scenes version 2.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Launch Scenes.

2. Choose Scenes Wizards.

3. Select Edit an existing collection.

4. Tab over to Edit this collection.

5. Hold down the SPACEBAR and press ENTER.

6. Two Scenes Wizard windows will appear. Close both.

This behavior occurs in other Windows-based applications. For example, in Control
Panel, holding down the SPACEBAR and pressing ENTER on the Edit pattern button
causes two windows to pop up.
