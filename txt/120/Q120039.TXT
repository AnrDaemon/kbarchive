TITLE   :NET VIEW Command Does Not List Novell NetWare Print Queues
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a system running Windows 95 with the Microsoft Client for Novell Networks
installed, performing a NET VIEW \\<NOVELL SERVER> command from an MS-DOS
prompt does not list the print queues.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if you are not logged on to the Novell server. The Microsoft
Client for Novell Networks must have read access to the PRINT_QUEUES information
in the Novell server's bindery in order to display the print queues.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, log on to the Novell server first, then use the NET
VIEW command to view the print queues on that server.

To list the print queues:

1. From an MS-DOS prompt, type the following command

   " net use <drive letter>: \\<novell server>\<share name> "
   (without the quotation marks)

2. Type your logon name when prompted.

3. Type your logon password when prompted.

4. Type the following command:

   " net view \\<novell server> " (without the quotation marks)

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ability to perform a NET VIEW command is one benefit of using the Microsoft
Client for Novell Networks. The "Novell NetWare Client for Workstation Shell 3.x
or Above" uses the IPX or IPXODI protocol. Performing a NET VIEW command from an
MS-DOS prompt does not work correctly with the Novell clients installed.

Novell NetWare is manufactured by Novell, Inc., a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
