TITLE   :6.22 Setup Err Msg with SCSI Device: Hard Disk Write Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install MS-DOS version 6.22 and Setup is 99 percent complete, the
following error message is displayed:

   UNRECOVERABLE ERROR
   Hard disk write Error
   Press Enter to restart system.

After you restart the system, the following error is generated:

   The MS-DOS 6.22 Setup was not completed.
   Insert the uninstall #1 diskette in drive A
   Press the ENTER key to continue

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur on systems with non-bootable SCSI devices (such as a
floptical drive or a CD-ROM drive) configured for SCSI ID 1 or 0 (zero). Device
IDs 0 and 1 are reserved for bootable/writeable "hard disk type" media;
therefore, Setup treats a device mounted as SCSI ID 1 or 0 as a hard disk
device. If the device does not respond appropriately, the above errors are
generated.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, reconfigure the device to ID 2 or higher.
