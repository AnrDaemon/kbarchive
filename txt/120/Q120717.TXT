-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If there is corruption within certain Windows NT system files, a blue screen may
appear with the following text at the top of the screen when you start your
computer:

   Init1         System Processor

CAUSE
=====

This is due to corruption to system files which may include HAL.DLL,
NTOSKRNL.EXE or other system files vital to starting Windows NT.

(Note: Your HAL file may differ from others. Depending on your hardware
environment, it could be called HAL486C.DLL, HALAST.DLL, HALCBUS.DLL,
HALMCA.DLL, or HALNCR.DLL.)

RESOLUTION
==========

If the Server or Workstation is in a production environment, you must have an
up-to-date Emergency Repair Disk (ERD). Using the ERD, you can choose the Verify
System Files option to restore valid files from CD or disk.

If the ERD is missing or corrupt itself, there is another workaround that may
restore your system files:

1. Make a backup of your current Windows NT files. This includes the WINNT
   directory and all subdirectories.

2. Install Windows NT to a different directory.

3. Apply any relevant Service Packs.

4. From the newly installed Windows NT directory, copy the entire SYSTEM32
   directory to the SYSTEM32 directory of the old installation.
