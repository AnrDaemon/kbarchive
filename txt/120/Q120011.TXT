The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to connect to a network resource using a WinLAN network card by
Apexx Technology, the following error message is displayed:

   The device does not exist on the network.

CAUSE
=====

The network resource that you are trying to connect to does not have a unique
network address. WinLAN cards require that a unique network address be set
through Network Setup.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the error message, do the following:

1. Open the Network Setup icon.

2. Choose the Drivers button, then choose the Setup button.

3. Choose the Advanced button, then choose the Configuration button. (This opens
   the Network Address dialog box.)

4. Make sure that the Network Address setting is unique for the network.

   All cards default to address 4 during the setup process; therefore, you need
   to change the number. Valid selections are from 4 to 254. Save your selection
   and then restart your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WinLAN cards are manufactured by Apexx Technology, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
