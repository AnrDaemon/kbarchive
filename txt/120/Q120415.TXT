SUMMARY
=======

According to Intel Corporation, if you are running the NET SatisFAXtion software
version 2.5 with Windows for Workgroups version 3.11, you must remove the
IPX/SPX Compatible Transport for proper operation of the FAXNODE software. The
Windows CAS manager in NET SatisFAXtion is designed to work with Novell NetWare
and does not support use on a Windows for Workgroups network. The FAXNODE
software is designed to operate with a Novell file called NWIPXSPX.DLL, which
conflicts with the Windows for Workgroups 32-bit version of the IPX/SPX
compatible transport.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: The configuration below should not be used if you need to run the Windows
for Workgroups network in conjunction with Novell NetWare or if you need to
communicate with other Windows for Workgroups or Windows NT machines across a
router. (NetBEUI is not a routable protocol where IPX/SPX is a routable
protocol.)

To work around this problem, Intel suggests removing IPX/SPX Compatible Transport
with NetBIOS in Network Setup. To do this, use the following steps:

1. In Program Manager, open the Networks group and double-click the Network
   Setup icon.

2. Choose the Drivers button and select IPX/SPX Compatible Transport with
   NetBIOS.

3. Choose the Remove button. Choose Yes when you are prompted for confirmation
   of this action.

4. Choose Close and then OK. Windows for Workgroups generates a message
   indicating that it has modified your .INI files and you should restart
   Windows to make the changes take effect.

5. Choose Restart Windows.

For more information about this issue and using other versions of NET
SatisFAXtion software with Windows for Workgroups, call the Intel FaxBack
service at either (503) 629-7576 or (800) 525-3019 and request fax #6120.
