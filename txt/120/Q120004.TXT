SYMPTOMS
========

When you run an MS-DOS prompt in a window and press ALT+TAB to switch to another
application, the title of the application you are switching to remains on the
screen in the task-switching window after you release the TAB key.

CAUSE

This problem occurs if you press the ALT+TAB key combination immediately after
pressing the ALT+SPACEBAR key combination without releasing the ALT key between
the two actions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To remove the task-switching window from the screen, you must press the ALT+TAB
key combination again.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
