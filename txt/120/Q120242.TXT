SUMMARY
=======

In FoxPro for Macintosh, you can have a CONFIG.FPM file on a workstation
automatically open when FoxPro is on the network by placing the CONFIG.FPM file
in the System Folder of the workstation. (This file is normally placed in the
FoxPro folder.)

MORE INFORMATION
================

On the Macintosh, there is no AUTOEXEC.BAT file in which to place the line "SET
FOXPROCFG=" in order to define an environment variable that identifies the
location of the CONFIG.FPM file.

Users at workstations can use a shared copy of FoxPro while having individual
CONFIG.FPM files if they start FoxPro by double-clicking the CONFIG.FPM file.
Placing the CONFIG.FPM file in the System Folder allows users at workstations to
have their own individual CONFIG.FPM files and also to start FoxPro by
double-clicking the FoxPro icon.

NOTE: If you double-click the FoxPro icon and there is a CONFIG.FPM file in the
FoxPro folder on the network, that file will be used instead of the CONFIG.FPM
file in the System Folder. Therefore, in a workstation situation, there should
only be a CONFIG.FPM file in the local workstation's System Folder and no
CONFIG.FPM file in the FoxPro folder on the network.

Having individual CONFIG.FPM files allows each user to customize various settings
for FoxPro, such as where to write temporary files to the local hard disk.
