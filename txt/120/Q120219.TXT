-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your Gateway2000 computer with a Mitsumi CD-ROM drive hangs on the first re-
boot during a Windows NT 3.5 install or upgrade.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT automatic hardware detection fails during the first re-boot of
installation with the Mitsumi drive. On subsequent re-boots, NT does not repeat
the hardware detection because it has already recorded information about the
machine in the registry.

WORKAROUND
==========

Remove the CD-ROM interface card (a very small card with a cable leading to the
CD-ROM). Re-boot and complete the installation. Once you have NT installed to
the point where you can log on, turn off your computer and reinsert the card.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
