TITLE   :PRB: ON KEY LABEL CMD+<Key_Name> Causes "Syntax Error"
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.5x,2.6a,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5x, 2.6a 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the command "ON KEY LABEL CMD+<key_name>" (without the quotation
marks), causes a "Syntax Error" error message.

CAUSE
=====

The ON KEY LABEL command does not support the Macintosh COMMAND (CMD) key.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use "ON KEY LABEL CTRL+<key_name>" (without the quotation marks) instead.
FoxPro for Macintosh treats the COMMAND key like the CTRL key, so pressing
either the COMMAND or the CTRL key will activate the ON KEY LABEL CTRL command.

For example, to display a WAIT window when either CTRL+A or COMMAND+A are
pressed, type the following in the Command window:

      ON KEY LABEL CTRL+A WAIT WINDOW 'Test'

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

In the Command window, type the following:

      ON KEY LABEL CMD+A WAIT WINDOW 'Test'

Press COMMAND+A. Note that a "Syntax Error" message is displayed.
