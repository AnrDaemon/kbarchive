======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the version 3.2 Mail Administrator program and choose the Queue
option to check mail queued for an external postoffice, there may be mail
messages that have not been deleted from the queue, even though the External
Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE) has successfully delivered the message to the
external postoffice. Because the mail message remains in the queue, it will be
delivered repeatedly until the administrator deletes the message from the queue.
This symptom has been noted specifically with external postoffices defined as
direct via modem.

CAUSE
=====

Once a message is successfully delivered, the External Mail program updates the
delete bit in the .KEY file to mark the header in the .MBG file as deleted. If
the <HEXID>.KEY file (<HEXID> is the 8-digit ID that corresponds to
the external postoffice) is not updated, the symptoms described above may occur.
This problem can be caused by a lack of sufficient file handles.

RESOLUTION
==========

Confirm that there is a FILES line in the CONFIG.SYS file and that it is set to
30 or more.

The default number of files allocated in MS-DOS is 20. The first 5 of these 20
are always assigned to the standard devices, which default to the CON, AUX, and
PRN character devices. This leaves 15 for the External Mail process.
