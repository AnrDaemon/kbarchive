floppy disk for drive A by using the /F parameter. The contents of this disk
vary based on the destination disk capacity.

   Filename    Attributes                Disk Size
   --------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: When using the 1.44 MB 3.5-inch MS-DOS 6.22 Step-Up disks to create a
startup disk on a 360K floppy, you receive the following error message:

   SETUP ERROR DETECTED

   The following disk error was detected.
   The listed file was not copied.

   Error writing --> scandisk.exe

   To continue, press ENTER.

If you press the ENTER key, the startup disk is created; however, it will contain
the following files only:

                           File
   Filename    Attributes
   ----------------------
   IO.SYS           SHR
   MSDOS.SYS        SHR
   COMMAND.COM        R
   DRVSPACE.EXE    A

NOTE: This problem does not occur when using the 1.2 MB 5.25-inch MS-DOS 6.22
Step-Up disks.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
