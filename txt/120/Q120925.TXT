SUMMARY
=======

The information in this article is included in the documentation starting with
Visual C++ 5.0. Look there for future revisions.

The following is based on the Visual C++ version 2.0 README.WRI file:

Using the Visual C++ Versions 1.5 and 2.0 Profilers
---------------------------------------------------

When you install the Profiler, you can enable the Visual C++ setup program to
modify the [profiler] section of your TOOLS.INI. Visual C++ version 1.5 uses the
same [profiler] block in TOOLS.INI to save Profiler settings. If the INIT
variable already points to an existing TOOLS.INI used by Visual C++, Setup will
modify the settings, preventing use of the Visual C++ version 1.5 profiler. To
use both versions, you must manually save the settings in the [profiler] section
of TOOLS.INI for each version and copy them into place when using a different
version of the Profiler.
