TITLE   :DOC: Documentation on fmod() Is Incorrect

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - The C Run-Time (CRT), included with:
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The fmod(x,y) function returns the floating point remainder of x/y, where x and
y are floating point numbers. If y is 0.0, fmod should return a NAN(not a
number) which it does, but the documentation on fmode says incorrectly that it
should return 0.

The document has been corrected in Visual C++ 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sample Code
-----------


   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <math.h>

   void main(void)
   {
    double x=10.0, y=0.0, z;

    z=fmod(x,y);
    printf("The remainder of %.2f/%.2f is %f\n", x, y, z);
   }


Output
------

The remainder of 10.00/0.00 is -1.#IND00 // Correct output

Additional query words: 1.00 2.00 double remainder
