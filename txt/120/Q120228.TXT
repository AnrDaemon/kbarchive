SUMMARY
=======

This article provides information about the password convention of Remote Access
Services (RAS) Point-to-Point (PTP) in Windows for Workgroups.

MORE INFORMATION
================

During setup of RAS PTP in Windows for Workgroups, you are presented with a
configuration dialog box. Be sure to select Allow Incoming Calls in this dialog
box. You may also want to enter a password in order to limit who has remote
access to your resources. (This password is the one remote users must enter as
their password for successful connection and validation to RAS PTP.) Listed
below are two common problems that occur with password validation.

Your Computer Rejects Valid Incoming Calls
------------------------------------------

If your computer occasionally rejects incoming calls from people using the valid
password, restart RAS on the server computer, and then choose the Answer button
again on your computer. If the problem persists, restart RAS on both the server
and client computers.

RAS Error 691: Invalid User Account or Password
-----------------------------------------------

The password that the remote user must use for validation is the same password
the server setup used in the RAS PTP configuration. If the two do not match, the
above error appears.
