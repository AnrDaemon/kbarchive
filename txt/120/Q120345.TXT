PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER::1994 edition,95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows 1994 edition 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Clicking an option on the menu bar in Microsoft Bookshelf '94 does not select
the correct option, or it causes the menu bar to become difficult to read. For
example, when you click Edit, the Tools menu options become visible instead.

CAUSE
=====

Bookshelf '94 makes changes to its menu bar under the assumption that the menu
bar font is the System font. In Windows 95, this assumption is false.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two methods for changing this behavior:

 - Bookshelf '94 has an option called Normal Menus that you can turn on and off.
   If this option is off, the above symptoms occur. Use the following steps to
   activate Normal Menus:
   1. Press the ALT key on your keyboard, then press the letter "T."

   2. Click Options.

   3. Click the Normal Menus check box to enable this option.

   -or-

 - Changing the menu bar font in Windows 95 to the System font also prevents the
   aforementioned symptoms. If you choose this method, the menu bar font is
   changed for all applications, not just Bookshelf '94:
   1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

   2. Double-click the Display icon. NOTE: You can skip steps 1 and 2 if you
      click the desktop with the right (secondary) mouse button and then click
      Properties.

   3. Click the Appearance tab.

   4. On the Item menu, click Menu Bar.

   5. On the Font menu, click System, then click OK.

STATUS
======

This situation is most likely caused by design changes in Windows 95. Microsoft
has confirmed that it is not caused by a problem in Windows 95.
