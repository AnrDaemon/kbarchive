SUMMARY
=======

The IBM Token Ring II EISA card is not supported in the final release of Windows
NT Workstation and Windows NT Server version 3.5, although it was supported in
the beta versions.

NOTE: It was also not supported by Windows NT 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install the final release of Windows NT 3.5, you will not see a
selection for the IBM Token Ring II EISA card. You must install a different
network adapter.

If a driver for this card was part of a beta installation, and you install the
final release as an upgrade, the card may continue to work using the beta
driver, but this configuration is not supported.

NOTE: This does NOT affect the IBM Token Ring II ISA card or the IBM Token Ring
16/4 card, both of which are supported.
