======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6x 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, version 2.6x 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using one of the following commands results in unexpected behavior when the
appropriate mouse button is subsequently pressed. The WAIT window flashes
briefly on the screen and then disappears:

      ON KEY LABEL RIGHTMOUSE WAIT WINDOW "<Text>"

   -or-

      ON KEY LABEL LEFTMOUSE WAIT WINDOW "<Text>"

   -or-

      ON KEY LABEL MOUSE WAIT WINDOW "<Text>"

RESOLUTION
==========

Two possible alternatives to using a WAIT window are:

 - Instead of using a WAIT window, use a procedure that defines a window,
   activates it, and places an @SAY "<Text>" command inside it.

-or-

 - Use the ON KEY LABEL RIGHTMOUSE SET MESSAGE TO "<Text>" command instead
   of a WAIT window. The text will appear on the status bar when the right mouse
   button is pressed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This command works as expected in FoxPro for MS-DOS.
