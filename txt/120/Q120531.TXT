PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Scenes (all collections), version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are running the "Copy a collection to floppy disk" wizard, and the
collection you are copying has a file that is greater in size than the disk(s)
to which you are copying, the wizard fails. For example, this problem occurs if
you are copying an 800K JPEG file to a 720K disk.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "Copy a collection to floppy disk" wizard will appear to be successful.
However, when trying to add the collection, the failure will occur. The JPEG
file will be unreadable, and the NFO and THM files will be fine.

This problem occurs because the wizard cannot split a file onto separate disks.
