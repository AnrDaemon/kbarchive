SUMMARY
=======

If you install Lotus Improv using the Improv server icon (created by installing
Improv as a server), you get this Improv network licensing dialog box error:

   Another user is attempting to open the license file at the same time you are,
   so Improv is unable to lock the logfile. See your network administrator."

CAUSE
=====

The Improv installation program does not copy a necessary file (IMPROV.V20) into
the IMP_SRV directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

Copy the file IMPROV.V20 manually from the original disk #1 into the directory
IMP_SERV on your hard disk.

If you don't have the original disks, create a file called IMPROV.V20 with a size
of greater than zero bytes in the IMP_SERV directory.
