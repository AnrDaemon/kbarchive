 - Microsoft Space Simulator for MS-DOS, version 1.0

SYMPTOMS
========

Some stars may appear as gray dots against the dawn or dusk sky of Earth.

CAUSE
=====

Stars in Space Simulator are of varying magnitude, very dim and distant stars
are painted against the black background of deep space as dark gray dots. When
these dim stars are painted across the bluish atmosphere of earth at dawn and
dusk, they will still appear as dark gray spots when you are viewing the stars
from a surface location.

RESOLUTION
==========

Reducing the value for the Star Limiting Magnitude in the Options, Preferences,
Scenery menu filters out some of the dimmer stars.
