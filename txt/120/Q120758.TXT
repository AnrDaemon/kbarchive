SYMPTOMS
========

System Error XXXXX messages appear in DHCP Manager (where XXXXX is the error
number) after you perform some actions. For example, a system error appears if
the database becomes corrupt or an administrator tries to exclude a range of IP
addresses from the scope when one of the IP addresses in the range is currently
leased to a DHCP client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Windows NT Server version 3.50. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
