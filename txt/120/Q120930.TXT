When a LAN Manager backup domain controller (BDC) or member server resides
in a Windows NT Server domain, the LAN Manager server may fall out of sync
with the primary domain controller. The following procedure describes how
to re-synchronize a LAN Manager Server in a Windows NT domain:

1. Demote the LAN Manager server to stand-alone. From NetAdmin, choose Security
   Settings from the Accounts menu. Change the Role of the server to standalone.

2. Remove the LAN Manager server from the domain. In Server Manager on the
   Windows NT Server, select the LAN Manager server. Choose Remove from Domain
   from the Computer menu.

3. Remove the LAN Manager server from the Server's group. From User Manager on
   the Windows NT Server, select the LAN Manager server. Choose Delete from the
   User menu.

4. Promote the LAN Manager server to a backup controller or member server. From
   NetAdmin, choose Security Settings from the Accounts menu. Change the role of
   the server back to BDC or Member.

5. From the OS/2 command prompt on the LAN Manager Server, run the following
   command:

   net accounts /sync
