The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta 1994 The Complete Multimedia Encyclopedia 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When trying to save a player in the MindMaze game included with Encarta, you may
receive the following error message

   NAME.SAV
   Cannot access this file.
   Please verify security privileges on the network drive

CAUSE
=====

After doing a slower installation of Encarta 1994, the working directory
(folder) points to the Encarta directory on the Encarta CD. Because files cannot
be saved to a CD-ROM, the error message is generated.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the working directory to the hard drive. Use one of the following
methods:

Set Up Encarta Again Using the Faster Option
--------------------------------------------

1. Run Encarta Setup and choose the Remove All button.

2. Reinstall Encarta and choose Faster from the Setup dialog box. This will
   automatically use the hard drive for the working directory.

Slower Install: Windows or Windows for Workgroups 3.1x
------------------------------------------------------

1. From the Program Manager, single-click the Encarta icon.

2. From the File menu, choose Properties.

3. Change the working directory to the directory on your hard drive where
   Encarta is installed (usually C:\ENCARTA).

4. Choose OK.

Slower Install: Windows 95
--------------------------

1. Click the Start Button, then click Run.

2. Type the Windows folder name (usually C:\WINDOWS), then click OK.

3. When the Windows folder opens, double-click the Start Menu folder.

4. Double-click the Programs folder, then double-click Microsoft Multimedia.

5. Single-click the Encarta icon.

6. On the File menu, click Properties. The property sheet appears.

7. Click the Shortcut tab.

8. In the Start In box, type the directory on the hard drive where Encarta is
   installed (usually C:\ENCARTA).

9. Click OK.

WORKAROUND
==========

To save to a different directory while in Encarta:

1. On the File menu, click Save A Player.

2. In the Save For dialog box, change the drive from the CD-ROM drive to the
   hard drive. The selected drive can be changed in the Drives box in the
   lower-right corner.

3. Under Directories (Folders), change to the Encarta subdirectory.

4. Click the OK button.
