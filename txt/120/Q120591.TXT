======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.6a 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are trying to install FoxPro, the Setup program runs in maintenance
mode, which prompts you to add or remove components of your current
installation, reinstall FoxPro, or remove all FoxPro components.

CAUSE
=====

The Setup program found files on the hard disk from a previous installation of
FoxPro.

RESOLUTION
==========

To install FoxPro from maintenance mode Setup, choose the Reinstall button.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although the main FoxPro folder of a previous installation of FoxPro may have
been deleted, some components of FoxPro may still exist in other folders, such
as the System Folder. When the Setup program finds these components, it switches
into maintenance mode.
