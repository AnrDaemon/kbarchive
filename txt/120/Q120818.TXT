SUMMARY
=======

When you make changes to your Windows for Workgroups network configuration,
Network Setup creates backup versions of your system configuration files in the
Windows for Workgroups directory.

When you complete a change to your network configuration using Network Setup, you
are prompted to either "Restart Windows" or "Continue"; or "Restart Computer" or
"Continue." Choosing to restart in either case causes copies of the system
configuration files to be generated and placed in the Windows for Workgroups
directory. The following example illustrates both the order in which the files
are copied and their respective target file names:

   PROTOCOL.INI  -->   WFW02
   SYSTEM.INI    -->   WFW03
   WIN.INI       -->   WFW04
   CONFIG.SYS    -->   WFW05
   AUTOEXEC.BAT  -->   WFW06

MORE INFORMATION
================

As pictured above, Windows for Workgroups uses the naming convention
"WFW<nn>," where <nn> is five sequential numbers. The range of file
sequences is 2 through 99999. Additional changes to the network configuration
produce five more backup files. These files are sequenced wherever there is a
contiguous gap. As many of these files can be created as free disk space
allows.

These files are backups only and can be removed if no longer needed for
troubleshooting.
