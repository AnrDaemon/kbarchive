The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

Pressing the TAB key in Slide or Notes view results in one of three different
actions, depending on what is initially selected:

1. If an object (or nothing) is selected:

   Pressing TAB selects the next object, following the order in which the objects
   were created. Pressing SHIFT+TAB selects the previous object.

2. If the cursor is within a bulleted text frame (body text):

   If the cursor is at the beginning of a line, pressing TAB demotes the indent
   of that line, while pressing SHIFT+TAB promotes the indent.

   At the beginning of a line, pressing CTRL+TAB (or OPTION+TAB on the Macintosh)
   overrides an indent and inserts a tab, moving the cursor to either the next
   default or user-defined tab stop. To remove these tabs, press the BACKSPACE
   key.

   If the cursor is within or at the end of the line, pressing TAB inserts a tab,
   moving the cursor to either the next default tab or user- defined tab stop.

3. If the cursor is within a text frame created using the Text tool pressing the
   TAB key inserts a tab, moving the cursor to the next default or user-defined
   tab stop.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Body text is the only object that has bullets by default. The TAB key is used to
promote or demote body text, in addition to the Demote and Promote buttons on
the toolbar.

All other objects, such as the text frames on the notes page, have no bullets by
default. You can promote or demote unbulleted text on notes pages by clicking
the Promote and Demote buttons on the toolbar.

If you want to use the TAB key to promote or demote text in the notes pages, you
must first turn on bullets. You can turn bullets on or off by clicking the
Bullet button on the toolbar.
