======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you want to be able to start FoxPro from the Apple menu, place an alias for
the FoxPro application program in the "<volume_name>:System Folder:Apple
Menu Items" folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An alias is a pointer to a file. It is generally safer to leave the original
"Microsoft FoxPro" file (or "Microsoft Visual FoxPro" with Visual FoxPro for
Macintosh 3.0b) in the FoxPro folder and place an alias for it elsewhere.

NOTE: Items placed in the "<volume_name>:System Folder:Apple Menu Items"
folder do not need to be removed when you perform a clean boot.

Steps to Place a FoxPro Alias on the Apple Menu
-----------------------------------------------

1. Open the FoxPro, or the Visual FoxPro, folder.

2. Select the "Microsoft FoxPro", or the "Microsoft Visual FoxPro", file.

3. From the File menu, choose Make Alias. This creates a file called "Microsoft
   FoxPro alias."

4. Open the "System Folder:Apple Menu Items" folder, located on your main hard
   disk (volume).

5. Drag the "Microsoft FoxPro alias" file from the FoxPro folder to the "System
   Folder:Apple Menu Items" folder.

NOTE: You can change the name of the "Microsoft FoxPro alias" file.

The next time you choose the Apple menu, you will see the alias file.
