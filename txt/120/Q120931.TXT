The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

The syntax displayed in the Microsoft TCP/IP-32 FTP utility online Help file,
MTCPIP32.HLP, is incorrect. According to the Help file, the syntax is:

   ftp [-v] [-n] [-i] [-d] [-g] [host] [-s: filename]

The correct syntax should be:

   ftp [-v] [-n] [-i] [-d] [-g] [-s:filename] [host]

The [host] parameter is at the end of the line after the [-s:filename] parameter,
and there is no space after "-s:" and before the filename. If the incorrect
syntax is used with the -s parameter, it pops up the ftp window and closes
before you can read the error message.
