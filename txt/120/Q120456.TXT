======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A RAS server cannot see a client that is connected with IPX Point-to-Point
Protocol (PPP) only. When you use the Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking client to
dial into a Windows NT 3.5x RAS server, the following error appears:

   No Domain server was able to validate your password. You may not be able to
   gain access to some network resources.

CAUSE
=====

Due to the default behavior of the IPX router on the RAS server, the RAS server
cannot see (by such means as a Send Message from Rasadmin, Net View, Net Use,
etc.) a RAS client that is connected through IPX PPP only.

NOTE: This does not affect the client's ability to access the RAS server or other
network resources on the RAS server's network.

RESOLUTION
==========

Connect with NetBEUI and/or TCP/IP in addition to IPX.

-or-

On the RAS server, change the following Registry value from 1 to 0:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
      \NwlnkIpx\Parameters\DisableDialinNetbios

WARNING: Using the Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of the Registry Editor
can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

NOTE: Also check that Windows 95 has NetBIOS support for IPX installed. You will
find this in the Control Panel Network applet, Configuration tab, listed as
"NETBIOS support for IPX/SPX-compatible protocol"
