 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5

SYMPTOMS
========

For no apparent reason, WINS Manager suddenly disappears (terminates).

CAUSE
=====

A WINS Manager thread attempting to automatically refresh the statistics on the
main WINS Manager window conflicts with another thread. This usually happens
when other dialog boxes are opened or closed.


WORKAROUND
==========

In the Preferences dialog box, clear the Auto Refresh check box or set the Auto
Refresh Interval to a higher value (in number of seconds).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Windows NT Server version 3.50. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
