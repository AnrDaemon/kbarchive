TITLE   :Resolved: WFW Popup Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Windows NT 3.1 computer sends a message to a Windows for Workgroups (WfWG)
3.11 computer running only IPX\SPX with NetBIOS, the WfWG 3.11 computer receives
this error (sent either as a print notification or a Net Send message) instead
of a message pop-up:

   There has been a failure of the network

This error does not occur with messages sent from Windows NT 3.5 computers.

CAUSE
=====

The streams stack is piggybacking the ack for the last message sent by the WfWG
3.11 machine (the SMB send message response) on the session end. Instead of
processing this ack, the WfWG stack returns an error because it gets a session
end before an ack. Windows NT 3.5 does not show this problem, because its stack
sends a data ack before the session end.

STATUS
======

A newer version of NWNBLINK.386 has been released and is available on the
Windows NT 3.5 distribution CD-ROM disks.
