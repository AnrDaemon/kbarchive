SYMPTOMS
========

When you print from WordPad on an IBM 4019PS17, the underscore character (_) in
the PostScript printer font Courier does not print.

CAUSE
=====

The PostScript font used by the IBM 4019PS17 has a lower underline position than
the Courier font of most printers. The printer font metrics (PFM) file used for
generic Courier causes a clipping rectangle, which is too small for the font, to
be created. The underscore is then clipped.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, print the document using the Windows 95 Courier New
TrueType font. To do this, you must first set up the printer to download Courier
New as an Outline font in the font substitution table.

To set up the IBM 4019PS17 printer to download Courier New as an Outline font, do
the following:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Use the right (secondary) mouse button to click the IBM 4019PS17 printer
   icon, and then choose Properties.

3. Click the Fonts tab. Click the Send Font As button and verify that the Send
   TrueType As field is set to Outline.

4. Click OK to return to the Fonts menu.

5. Verify that the "Send TrueType fonts to printer according to the Font
   Substitution Table" option is selected.

6. Click the Edit The Table button.

7. Choose Courier New in the For This TrueType Font column and verify that
   Courier is currently set in the Use Printer Font column.

8. In the Printer Font For box, scroll to the top of the list and choose Send As
   Outlines.

9. Click OK to accept the new settings.
