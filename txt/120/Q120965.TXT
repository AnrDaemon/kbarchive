SYMPTOMS
========

Compiling an application that uses a local temporary static union, as does the
sample code shown in the More Information section below, may cause the following
internal compiler error when built with debug information only:

   TEST.CPP(9) : fatal error C1001: INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR
   (compiler file 'e:\b_bld\c2\P2\main.c', line 374)
   Please choose the Technical Support command on the Visual C++ Help menu, or
   open the Technical Support help file for more information

TEST.CPP is the sample code file given in the More Information section below.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use either of these two workarounds:

 - Remove the /Zi compiler option.

-or-

 - Create an object to represent the local static union:

         static union { int z;} tmp;

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was fixed in Visual C++, 32-bit Edition,
version 4.0.
