The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5

SYMPTOMS
========

Under Windows NT, Corel Ventura posts a C runtime error message when it is
started.

CAUSE
=====

Corel Ventura cannot operate in a long path environment such as NT. Under
Windows and Windows for Workgroups, by contrast, path length is limited to 128
characters, and Corel Ventura operates correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Shorten the path length so that it does not exceed 128 characters.
