The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS, version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you share a network printer (NET SHARE PRINTER=LPTx) from a Workgroup
Add-On for MS-DOS machine and you change to a large directory (more than 50
files), your hard disk continuously spins. This continuous access slows down
other commands (such as DIR), making your computer work slower.

CAUSE
=====

Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS uses conventional memory to spool print jobs in
order to be backwards compatible. This spooler requires buffers or a drive cache
to do to operate optimally.

RESOLUTION
==========

To stop the spooler from continuously accessing the hard disk in large
directories, do the following:

 - Open the AUTOEXEC.BAT file in a text editor (such as Windows Notepad) and set
   SMARTDRV.EXE as the first statement.

-or-

 - Open the CONFIG.SYS file in a text editor (such as Windows Notepad) and set
   BUFFERS to a value greater than 30.
