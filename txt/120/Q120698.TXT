-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Space Simulator treats all objects as spherical models, with a diameter
encompassing the longest dimension. This spherical boundary is important due to
the different ways in which Space Simulator can measure distance between two
objects. Space Simulator has three different ways of measuring distance:
Altitude, Distance, and Radius.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Altitude is a measure of the distance, in meters, between the surface of the
spherical boundary of your spacecraft and the surface of the spherical boundary
of the reference object.

NOTE: Objects that appear considerably longer than their width or height (such as
the Zander Freighter) may report an altitude that does not appear correct.

Distance is a measure of the distance, in meters or light years, between the
center of the spherical boundary of your spacecraft and the center of the
spherical boundary of the reference object.

Radius is a measure of the distance, in radii, between the center of the
spherical boundary of your spacecraft and the center of the spherical boundary
of the reference object.
