TITLE   :FIX: DX1020 Using TEXTEQU to Define False IF Block
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::6.0a,6.0b,6.1,6.1a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0a, 6.0b, 6.1, 6.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the TEXTEQU directive to define an IF statement that evaluates to FALSE
produces the following error message in MASM version 6.1 or 6.1a:

   DOSXNT : fatal error DX1020: unhandled exception: General protection fault

When you use ML from MASM version 6.0b, an "Application Error" message box
appears when running from a Windows MS-DOS box. From straight MS-DOS, the
following error message occurs:

   fatal error A1000: cannot open file : error #xx -
   : Macro Called From Main Line Code

Using MLX from MASM version 6.0b produces the following error message:

   run-time error R6915
   - DOSX16 : unhandled exception

Using ML from MASM version 6.0a, the following error messages occur:

   fatal error A2051: text item required
   : Macro Called From Main Line Code
   fatal error A1010: unmatched block nesting : _text

RESOLUTION
==========

Use IFDEF expressions along with the /D assembler option to perform conditional
assembly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the products listed above.

This problem was corrected in MASM version 6.11.

MORE INFORMATION
