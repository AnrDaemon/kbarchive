SYMPTOMS
========

When a RAS client dials into a RAS server that is undocked from its docking
station, the RAS server cannot see the client through the usual means such as
Net View, Net Use, Send Message from Radadmin, etc):

 - "Net View \\<client>" reports: Error 53 - Network path not found

 - Rasadmin "Send Message" reports: The message alias could not be found on the
   network

NOTE: The RAS client can see and access network resources on the RAS server: the
problem is that the server cannot see the client.

CAUSE
=====

When it is on an undocked laptop, the RAS server must be configured for "view
this computer only" in RAS Setup.

RESOLUTION
==========

Control Panel->Network->Configure RAS->Network->NetBEUI / TCP/IP /
IPX- >Configure).

The RAS server now can see the client.
