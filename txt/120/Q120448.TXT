SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft provides a replacement for the MAILMGR.DLL file that is included with
version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows.

For complete information about obtaining and installing the MAILMGR.DLL file, see
the following sections:

 - To download the updated file

 - To update your MAILMGR.DLL file

MORE INFORMATION
================

This update contains MAILMGR.DLL, a replacement for the MAILMGR.DLL file that is
included with version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows. The replacement file
provides additional enhancements to the original MAILMGR.DLL file.

This replacement file resolves the following problem that can occur when you use
version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows:

 - The Check Names function fails to properly resolve partial friendly names and
   returns several selections when a unique resolution is possible. This
   behavior is most obvious when the GAL is selected as the default address list
   and the first and last name of the intended recipient begin with the same
   letter.

   NOTE: To resolve this problem, two .DLL files must be updated: the MAILMGR.DLL
   file (update included in this update) and the MSSFS.DLL file (update included
   in MSSFS.EXE on the MSL).

To download the updated file
----------------------------

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

To replace your MAILMGR.DLL file
--------------------------------

1. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

   " copy <path>:\mailmgr.dll <destination> " (without the quotation
   marks)

   where <path> is the drive and directory where you ran the self
   extracting MAILMGR.EXE file and <destination> is the drive and
   directory where your MAILMGR.DLL file currently resides. For example, if you
   ran the self-extracting file from the TEST directory on drive D, and your
   MAILMGR.DLL file is located in the MAILEXE directory on drive C, type the
   following command:

   " copy d:\test\mailmgr.dll c:\mailexe " (without the quotation marks)

2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

   " copy <mailexe>\setup.inf <mailexe>\setupinf.old " (without the
   quotation marks)

   where <mailexe> is the complete path to the directory containing the
   Microsoft Mail for Windows SETUP.EXE program. For example, if SETUP.EXE is
   located in the MAILEXE directory on drive C, type the following command:

   " copy c:\mailexe\setup.inf c:\mailexe\setupinf.old " (without the quotation
   marks)

3. Using any text editor, edit the SETUP.INF file. In the [MSMAIL] section,
   replace the following line

   1, mailmgr.dll,,,, 1993-03-09, !DECOMPRESS,, OLDER, !READONLY,,,,, SHARED,
   51632,,,, 3.2.0.4027,

   with:

   1, mailmgr.dll,,,, 1994-07-21, !DECOMPRESS,, OLDER, !READONLY,,,,, SHARED,
   51696,,,, 3.2.0.4074,

   Save the file and close the text editor.

   NOTE: For these changes to affect the entire network, each existing user must
   run Setup again.
