SUMMARY
=======

This article describes a script that allows Windows NT Remote Access Service
(RAS) clients to connect to a Microsoft Windows NT RAS server equipped with an
Eicon card over the Sita Group Network X.25 service. Sita Group Network is also
known as Scitor, Inc.

NOTES:

   This script has only been tested at 9600 baud without compression
   enabled.

   This script does NOT work with RAS for Windows for Workgroups (WfWG)
   version 3.11. However, there is a SWITCH.INF script available for RAS
   for WfWG. For information on that, please see the following article in
   the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE : WFW 3.11 RAS: X.25 Script for Sita Group Network Services


MORE INFORMATION
================

Follow these steps to build and install the new script:

1. Make a backup copy of your existing PAD.INF file in your
   %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\RAS subdirectory by copying it to a new filename.

2. Load the existing PAD.INF into Notepad and append the script below to the
   file and save it. Quit Notepad.

3. Start RAS, select the entry for the Sita X.25 provider in the phonebook list.

4. Choose the Edit button.

5. If you don't see an X.25 button, choose the Advanced button, and then choose
   the X.25 button.

6. In the PAD Type field, select Sita Group Network.

7. Contact your system administrator if you don't know any of the following
   information:

   a. In the X.121 Address field, enter the x.121 address of your RAS server.

   b. In the User Data field, enter the NUI number (usually in the format of "NUI
   xxxxxxxx" where the "xxxxxxxx" needs to be replaced by numbers).

   c. In the "Facilities" field, enter the user's password.

8. Choose the OK button.

9. Choose the Modem button. Select the appropriate baud rate up to 9600 bps and
   select Enable Hardware Flow Control and Enable Modem Error Control.

   NOTE: Modem compression is not recommended unless software compression is not
   available, however, this script has not been tested with any kind of
   compression enabled. Leave the Enter Modem Commands Manually check box clear
   and choose OK and then choose OK again to return to the Remote Access
   program.

Remote Access is now ready to use this script and dial the server.

Following is the script to be appended to the PAD.INF file:
