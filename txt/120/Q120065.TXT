TITLE   :BUG: Help Files Not Available After Installing Samples Only
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::6.1,6.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.1, 6.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Run the setup program and install everything but the samples. Run the setup
program again and install only the samples. The NEW-VARS.BAT file is rewritten,
but without setting the HELPFILES environment variable, because the Help files
were not just installed. As a result, the Help files are not available in
Programmer's WorkBench (PWB).

RESOLUTION
==========

Edit the NEW-VARS.BAT and set the HELPFILES environment variable. As an example,
if MASM is installed in C:\MASM611, then set HELPFILES to C:\MASM611\HELP\*.HLP.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in MASM versions 6.1 and 6.11. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
