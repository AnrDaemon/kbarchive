TITLE   :Scenes 2.0: Causes Divide by Zero Error Under Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER:2.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Scenes (all collections), version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When password protection is turned on while you are running Windows NT, and the
screen saver is interrupted and no password is entered, Scenes pauses and then
starts the screen saver. The amount of time Scenes pauses depends on the amount
of time set in the Start Screen Saver After option.

This may cause the following error message:

   Application Error: integer divide by 0.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Scenes version 2.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are running Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.11, Scenes waits
three minutes before starting the screen saver under the above conditions.
Scenes will not wait the amount of time entered in the Start Screen Saver After
option like it does in Windows NT.
