SUMMARY

network cards.

This article provides information about the hardware and configuration options
available with the WinLAN bundles.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Network Software
----------------

The WinLAN network cards are designed to work with both Windows for Workgroups
and Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS.

Cabling
-------

The network uses 802.3 packets and RJ-11 phone cable or twisted-pair cable
(RJ-45) if an RJ-11 end is installed. The network works with or without a hub.
The cards can be daisy-chained together. Apexx does sell a hub, which allows you
to connect daisy-chains of up to eight computers per hub connection.

NOTE: You cannot use a 10baseT (twisted-pair) hub.

Each NIC has two RJ-11 ports similar to a modem. It does not matter which plug is
used for "in" or which is used for "out." The cable plugs into one computer and
then daisy-chains to the next computer. Each computer on the end of a chain
should have a terminator plug (an RJ-11 plug with an 120-ohm terminating
resistor).

The network transmits at 1 MPS. It has a total cable length specification of 600
feet.

Since WinLAN network cards do not classify as Ethernet, ArcNet, or token ring, a
bridge must be used to communicate with a network using one of these
topologies.
