SYMPTOMS
========

A "divide-by-zero" error occurs when you print to a network printer from
CA-SuperProject if the printserver or printer name has a period (".") in it.

CAUSE
=====

If the printer Universal Naming Convention (UNC) name contains a period (eg:
\\printlab.1\bartsimp.son) and SuperProject does not accept periods in a UNC
printer name.

RESOLUTION
==========

Either rename the shared printer using a name without periods or NET USE to the
shared printer and print from SuperProject to the redirected LPT port.
