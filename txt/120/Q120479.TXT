SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when you try to restore a saved
player in Encarta's MindMaze game:

   MindMaze
   You selected a MindMaze game file that is either not valid or is corrupt.
   Please select another file.

This occurs if you try to load a player in Encarta 1994 that was created and
saved in the 1993 edition of Encarta.

STATUS
======

MindMaze 1993 .SAV files are not in the same format as MindMaze 1994 files. You
cannot use saved players from 1993 edition in the 1994 edition.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the 1994 edition of Microsoft
Encarta. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
