TITLE   :"Routine Not Found" Message Box While Viewing Help File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While you are viewing a help file, the "Routine Not Found" message box appears.

CAUSE
=====

The help file invokes the RemoveAccelerator() macro, which is not implemented in
Windows NT 3.1 or 3.5.

The RemoveAccelerator() macro, as documented in the Windows Help Authoring Guide,
is not available on Windows NT 3.1 or 3.5. An accelerator key added using
AddAccelerator() cannot be removed. Invoking RemoveAccelerator() in your help
file brings up the "Routine Not Found" message box.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not invoke the RemoveAccelerator() macro.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
