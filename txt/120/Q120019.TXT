SUMMARY
=======

Although the "Microsoft Windows NT System Guide" states that Print Manager can
create, remove, and administer printers on remote servers, it has the following
limitations administering remote server print queues:

 - The Print menu Connect To Printer option connects printers only on the local
   server, even when the focus is set to a remote server. If you want to create
   a NetWare printer that is shared through the Gateway service, you must create
   it at the local machine (because you have to create a connection to the
   NetWare printer share).

 - When creating a printer on a remote server, Print Manager cannot choose a
   printer that is not physically connected to that remote server. When you
   attempt to create remote printer, the following error message appears:

   The parameter is incorrect

 - The Print menu Connect To Printer option under Windows NT 3.5 can create a
   printer based on a port that is already defined on the remote server. If you
   choose Create Printer from the Print menu and attempt to connect to a port
   for DLC or LPR, the following error appears:

   Could not add port. The network request is not supported.

   This type of action requires the DLL, which is responsible for managing the
   port, to load. Loading the DLL across the network is not supported at this
   time.
