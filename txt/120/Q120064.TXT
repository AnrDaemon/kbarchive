TITLE   :BUG: Error A2005 Generated Due to Conflict with Global Label
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::6.1,6.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.1, 6.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

According to page 354 of the "MASM 6.1 Programmer's Guide," labels within a
procedure that are defined with a single colon are local, provided there is a
language specifier on the .Model statement. However, if the symbol used for a
local label appears as a global label in an earlier part of the source file, the
following error is generated during assembly:

   A2005: symbol redefinition

RESOLUTION
==========

If possible, rearrange the code so that the global label does not appear before
the local label.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in MASM versions 6.1 and 6.11. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample code can be used to demonstrate the problem. If "two proc"
were placed after "one proc", there would be no assembly errors and the "jmp
two" would cause a jump to the local label "two".

Sample Code
-----------

   ; Assemble options needed: none

      .model small, C
      .code

      two proc
         ret
      two endp

      one proc

         jmp two
         nop

      two:            ; error A2005: symbol redefinition : two

      one endp
      end
