SUMMARY
=======

After you click Properties to open a properties dialog box, the default keyboard
focus is on the first control box of the sheet. In the 5 1/4 (or 3 1/2) Floppy
properties dialog box, the focus is on the Label box. If you press any key on
the keyboard at this point, the volume label for the disk in that drive is
removed or replaced.

This can cause problems with software that requires the disk to have a volume
label for verification or security purposes. After the volume label has been
changed, there is no method in Windows 95 to undo the change. You must re-enter
the volume label manually. If you don't know what the previous volume label name
was, you may need to contact the manufacturer of the data on the disk to
retrieve the volume label name.

Additional query words: missing label standard highlight
