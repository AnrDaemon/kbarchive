TITLE   :WINS Manager: Config. and Replication Partners Menus Disabled

When using WINS Manager to administer a remote WINS server, you may notice
that all menu options are enabled except for the Configuration and
Replication Partners options of the Server menu.

Most WINS Manager commands are performed using IP-to-IP (non-NetBIOS)
connections. However, the Configuration and Replication Partners options
run over RPC which requires NetBIOS sessions (over TCP/IP) to be
established. If the NetBIOS connection fails, these two menu items will
appear disabled. Similarly, attempting to use Registry Editor to remotely
access the computer's Registry will fail because it also relies on an RPC
connection to be established. Once a NetBIOS connection is made, these
options are enabled.

To fix this problem:

1. Verify that you are a member of the Administrators or Domain Administrators
   groups and that you are logged in with a proper password.

2. Verify that you are able to get a "Name to IP" resolution of the name of the
   WINS server you are focused on:

   a. From the Options menu choose Preferences. Try setting the address display
      as "Computer Name (IP Address)" and/or "IP Address (Computer Name)" and
      set the focus again on the remote WINS server by selecting it from the
      list of WINS servers.

   b. Use the IPCONFIG /ALL command to find the IP addresses of the primary and
      secondary WINS servers you are consulting. Then enter the IP address and
      name of the remote WINS server as a static mapping into the database of
      the primary and secondary WINS servers you are consulting.

NOTE: Verify that all WINS servers are configured with static (not dynamic)
IP Addresses; they should not be DHCP clients.
