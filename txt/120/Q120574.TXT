TITLE   :TRACERT Does Not Return Correct IP Name
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Using the TRACERT command with Microsoft TCP/IP-32 does not return the correct
IP name (Inverse Mapping). For example, running

   tracert 130.20.7.77

should result with the following output:

   plato.lc.microsoft.com.20.130.IN-ADDR.ARPA

CAUSE
=====

TCP/IP-32 does not send a properly formatted query to a Domain Name Server
(DNS).


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft TCP/IP-32
protocol. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

and 20.18 (information on Inverse Mappings and Pointer Queries).
