The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a printer that you created or connected to in Print Manager becomes
unavailable, Borland Quattro Pro still shows it in the Printer Setup dialog box.
If you try to print to it, a General Protection Fault (GPF) in QPW.EXE at
00BA:0B55 occurs.

CAUSE
=====

Quattro Pro does not verify printer availability when it displays a list of
printers in its Printer Setup dialog box.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Windows NT Workstation and Server version
3.51.

Use Print Manager to verify that a printer is available before using it in
Quattro Pro.

STATUS
======

This problem was corrected in Windows NT Workstation or Server version 3.51.
