-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An OS/2 application with Ring2 code (an IOPL application) running in Windows NT
may hang with the error message:

   Error OS/2 error code 8

Note: This is an OS/2 message. Other OS/2 applications may fail to run after a
number of Ring2 applications are loaded.

CAUSE
=====

By design, an OS/2 application with Ring2 code and no IN/OUT instructions cannot
run on Windows NT. After you run about 90 such applications, no additional OS/2
applications can be run until you stop and restart OS2SRV or reboot your
computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem has been corrected in Windows NT
Workstation and Windows NT Server version 3.5.
