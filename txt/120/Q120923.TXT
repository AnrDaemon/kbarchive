======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The C Run-Time (CRT), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following is based on the Visual C++ version 2.0 README.WRI file:

New Multithreading Routines
---------------------------

The Microsoft Run-Time Library for Visual C++ contains many new routines. Among
these are _beginthreadex and _endthreadex, which are extensions to _beginthread
and _endthread, respectively. Using _beginthreadex and _endthreadex can provide
advantages over using the Win32 APIs CreateThread and ExitThread, especially in
preventing loss of memory resources. See the Run-Time Library Reference for more
information about these new routines.

Other Notes
-----------

The following routines do not behave properly under the conditions cited.

assert
------

The assert function is not compatible with non-console applications. It causes
the application to exit with exit code 0x03 but does not display a diagnostic
message "Assertion Failed" in a pop-up window.

_mbsnbcmp, _mbsnbicmp
---------------------

Each of these functions may return a random value when the value specified for
the third argument causes a terminating NULL character ('\0') to be included in
a string comparison. For example,

   _mbsnbcmp ( "ABC", "ABC", n )
   where n<=3, returns 0. However,
   _mbsnbcmp ( "ABC", "ABC", n )
   where n => 4, returns a random value.

_mbscmp, _mbsncmp, _mbsnbcmp
----------------------------

When comparing an uppercase letter to the corresponding lowercase letter, each of
these functions evaluates the uppercase letter as greater than the lowercase
letter. For example, 'A' is evaluated as greater than 'a.' strcmp and strncmp
correctly exhibit the opposite behavior.
