TITLE   :DRVSPACE /MOUNT Err Msg: Cannot Find the File DRVSPACE.000
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SUMMARY
=======

If your DoubleSpace-compressed drive is already mounted and you run the
following command

   " dblspace /mount <x>: " (without the quotation marks)

where <x> is the drive letter, the following incorrect error message is
displayed:

   Cannot find the file DBLSPACE.000

This message should actually state that drive x is already mounted; it should not
imply that the compressed volume file (CVF) is not found on the system.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine whether the CVF has been previously mounted, type the following
command

   " dblspace /list " (without the quotation marks)

You can use the DIR command and then search for the CVF name stated in the error
message.

NOTE: The error message always returns the CVF file extension .000, which is not
necessarily the correct extension.

Additional query words: 6.00 6.20 6.21 6.22 invalid err msg
