The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows NT Workstation or Server computer with a Mitsumi CD-ROM exhibits
disruptions in video playback: images stop moving, sounds repeat or have gaps.
Files can still be read from the drive as normal.

CAUSE
=====

The Mitsumi CD-ROM driver spends up to a third of a second at the DPC level,
where it has complete control of the computer and locks out all other programs.
This freezes video and fragments audio. When sounds clips are playing and the
hardware does not receive the data for the next part of the clip, the system can
neither complete nor stop the sound, so the drive just repeats the last data it
received.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

The CD-ROM mentioned here is manufactured by Mitsumi, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
