The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you start PowerPoint, two dialog boxes appear before a blank presentation
is opened for you to work in. These dialog boxes are New Presentation and
Autolayout. If you always prefer to begin with the same basic layout and want to
bypass the two initial dialog boxes, you can force PowerPoint to load the
Default.ppt presentation automatically.

NOTE: If you do this, make Default.ppt read-only so that you don't accidentally
overwrite it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To make PowerPoint open directly to a blank presentation, use the appropriate
procedure for your version of PowerPoint.

PowerPoint 7.0
--------------

1. Open a blank presentation in PowerPoint and save the presentation as
   Blank.pot in the same folder that you find Powerpnt.exe (Blank.pot is found
   in the Templates folder initially).

2. Start the Windows Explorer, use the right mouse button to click the Blank.pot
   icon, and drag it to the desktop.

3. A shortcut menu appears. Click Create Shortcut here.

4. Click on this icon when you want to enter PowerPoint with the Blank.pot as
   the default presentation being the first thing you see.

PowerPoint 4.x
--------------

1. Run PowerPoint, choose the options you would like to load as the default,
   make any desired changes to the default slide (for example, font, color, or
   layout), and save the file as Default.ppt. Make sure you save it in the same
   directory as the PowerPoint executable file.

2. Exit PowerPoint.

3. In Program Manager, click the PowerPoint icon. Click Properties on the File
   menu.

4. The Command Line box in the Program Item Properties dialog box contains
   something similar to the following:

   C:\Powerpnt\Powerpnt.Exe

   Change this line to read

   "C:\Powerpnt\Powerpnt.Exe C:\Powerpnt\Default.Ppt" (without the quotation
   marks)

   where drive C is the drive where the PowerPoint directory resides, and
   Powerpnt is the PowerPoint directory.

5. Click OK to save the changes.

6. Open File Manager and select the file C:\POWERPNT\DEFAULT.PPT.

7. On the File menu, click Properties.

8. Under Attributes, select the Read Only check box. Click OK and close File
   Manager.

9. Double-click the icon to start PowerPoint.
