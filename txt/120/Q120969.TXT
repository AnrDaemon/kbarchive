SUMMARY
=======

The Telnet client utility that ships with Windows 95 (TELNET.EXE) does not
support mapping characters to Telnet characters. For example, if you use Telnet
to access a UNIX machine, some utilities let you map the BACKSPACE key to the
DELETE key. TELNET.EXE does not provide this functionality.

The Telnet utility that ships with Windows 95 contains the basic features
necessary to have a Telnet session to a host. Most UNIX hosts let you select the
terminal type; therefore, you can overcome any keyboard incompatibilities.

Additional query words: tty
