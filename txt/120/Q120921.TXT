SUMMARY
=======

The following is based on the Visual C++ version 2.0 README.WRI file:

Interaction Between setjmp/longjmp and C++ Exception Handling
-------------------------------------------------------------

The use of setjmp and longjmp is strongly discouraged in C++ programs. However,
if you use these functions and compile with the /GX option (Enable Exception
Handling), destructors for local objects will be called during the stack unwind.
Note that the use of setjmp and longjmp in C++ programs may degrade performance
by preventing optimization on local variables.

This interaction between setjmp/longjmp and C++ exception handling is supported
only when you include SETJMP.H or SETJMPEX.H.

If you are writing code that is intended to be portable, do not rely on correct
destruction of frame-based objects when executing a non-local goto using a call
to longjmp. The use of C++ exception handling try/catch constructs is
recommended in C++ programs instead of setjmp and longjmp.
