TITLE   :Command Line Does Not Update Print Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1 3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you delete a printer share name from the command line, the Printers folder
(in Windows NT 4.0) or the Print Manager properties (in Windows NT 3.5x) for
that printer are not updated. Instead, the properties for that printer
erroneously show the printer as still being shared.

For example, to delete a share name, use the following command:

   net share <printer share name> /delete

The share still appears to be in the Printer properties Sharing tab (in version
4.0) or the Printer Properties section of Print Manager (in version 3.5x).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5, 3.51,
and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After the share is deleted, you will be unable to connect to the printer with
the NET USE command. You will, however, be able to connect to the printer from a
Windows NT client using the Add printer Wizard (in version 4.0) or by using
Print Manager (in version 3.5x).
