-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The brushes on Photoshop's Brush palette display incorrectly, appearing as
rectangles instead of circles or with lines through them.

CAUSE
=====

Photoshop uses both 4plane/1bpp and 1plane/4bpp bitmaps. It does not send the
correct conversion information for these bitmaps to GDU because it does not read
the DEVCAPS values from Windows NT.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
