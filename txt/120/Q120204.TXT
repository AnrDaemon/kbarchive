The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Multimedia Mozart for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article provides instructions to manually install Microsoft Mozart,
versions 1.0 and 1.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

These instructions assume:

 - Your hard disk is drive C

 - Your destination folder is C:\Mozart

 - Your Windows folder is C:\Windows

 - Your CD-ROM drive is drive D

If your hard disk drive, destination folder, Windows folder, or CD-ROM drive
letters are different, replace the drive letters and folder names throughout
this article with the drive letters and folder names on your computer.

NOTE: The following instructions discuss copying, editing, and modifying folders
and files. For more information about accomplishing these tasks in Windows, see
your Windows printed documentation or online Help.

Steps for Windows or Windows for Workgroups, Versions 3.x
---------------------------------------------------------

If you are running Microsoft Windows 3.x, follow these steps. When copying files,
exit Windows and copy from the MS-DOS command prompt. Allow MS-DOS to overwrite
any files it finds on your hard drive.

1. Create a folder on your hard disk called C:\Mozart.

   For example, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER
   at the end of the line:

   "md c:\mozart" (without the quotation marks)

2. Copy all the files from the D:\Mozart folder to C:\Mozart. The files are:
    - Glossary.idx

    - Index.nam

    - Mozart.map

    - Index.dat

    - Mozart.exe (1.0 Only)

    - Mozart mgf

    - Index.map

    - Msmozart.exe (1.0a Only)

    - Mozart.mpf

    - Readme.txt

   For example, to copy Mozart.exe, type the following at the MS-DOS command
   prompt and press ENTER at the end of the line:

   "copy d:\mozart\mozart.exe c:\mozart" (without the quotation marks)

   IMPORTANT: Media Vision's Mozart sound card also uses a file named Mozart.exe.
   If you are using a Media Vision Mozart sound card, rename the Microsoft
   Mozart 1.0 Mozart.exe file to Msmozart.exe to prevent problems running
   Microsoft Mozart. To make sure you rename the correct Mozart.exe file, use
   the file dates and size to distinguish between the files. The Microsoft
   Mozart.exe file is 248,343 bytes and is dated 9-3-93. Remember to replace the
   file Mozart.exe with Msmozart.exe as it pertains in the following
   instructions.

   NOTE: On the Mozart 1.0a CD, Mozart.exe has been renamed to Msmozart.exe and
   avoids this problem.

3. Create a folder in C:\Mozart called either Illus256 or Illus16, depending on
   the video resolution you are using:
    - If you are using a 16-color video driver, use C:\Mozart\Illus16

    - If you are using a 256-color video driver, use C:\Mozart\Illus256

4. Create a folder named Hd in the folder created in step 3.
    - For 16-color settings, use C:\Mozart\Illus16\Hd

    - For 256-color settings, use C:\Mozart\Illus256\Hd

5. Copy all the files from either D:\Mozart\Illus16\Hd folder or
   D:\Mozart\Illus256\Hd folder to the matching folder on drive C.

6. Copy all the files in the D:\Mozart\Msstp\Shared folder to the
   C:\Windows\System folder.

7. Copy all the files in the D:\Mozart\Msstp\System folder to the
   C:\Windows\System folder.

   d. Click OK.

9. Use a text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad, to make the following changes
   to the Mozart.ini file, which is located in the Windows folder. If the
   Mozart.ini file does not already exist, create one in the Windows folder with
   these entries:

      [Mozart]
      CDPath=D:\Mozart
      HDPath=C:\Mozart

10. Use a text editor to make the following changes to the Windows information
   files, which are located in the Windows folder:
