SYMPTOMS
========

When Windows NT is heavily stressed by LAN Manager 2.2 clients running CadexNet
document control software, the following STOP message appears:

   STOP: 0x0000000A(0x004E00CB, 0x00000002,0x00000000,0x801135D8
   Memory at 0x004E00CB was accessed at IRQL 2 for 0 [r] access from 0x801135D8

   Base 80100000 == NTOSKRNL.EXE

   0x801135D8
   - 0x80100000
   -----------------
   offset: 0x000135D8


This only occurs with LAN Manager 2.2 and 2.2b clients. It does not occur with
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 clients.

CAUSE

open/close operations.
