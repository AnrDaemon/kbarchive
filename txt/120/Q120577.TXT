TITLE   :FIX: GP Fault When Copying Between Two Resource Scripts
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSToolskbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 2.0, on platform(s):
    - the hardware: MIPS 
    - the hardware: Intel x86 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Resource Browser feature to copy and paste multiply selected
resources between two resource scripts, Visual C++ may terminate with a general
protection (GP) fault. This problem occurs only if one of the selected resources
being copied is a string table, and the resource script being copied to contains
a string table.

RESOLUTION
==========

Avoid selecting string tables when doing copy and paste with multiply selected
resources.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the products listed at the beginning
of this article. This problem was not reproducible in Microsoft Visual C++,
32-bit Edition, version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Open or create a resource script that contains one or more string tables and
   at least one other resource. A second resource script must contain at least a
   string table.

2. Expand all of the resources.

3. Select some or all of the resources including the string table and at least
   one other resource type. You can use the Shift+mouseclick selection.

4. Copy the resources using either the keyboard commands or by choosing Copy
   from the Edit menu.

5. Paste the resources into the other script.

6. Click OK to the message box that says "String tables cannot be merged. Open
   string tables and copy individual strings."

At this point, a GP fault occurs.
