======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

 - When you run Windows Explorer, you see a plus sign (+) before each folder or
   tree.

 - When you run File Manager, you do not see the plus or minus signs (+ or -)
   before each folder or directory.

CAUSE
=====

 - In Windows Explorer, the plus sign appears before network directories and
   floppy disk drives for performance reasons. Ghosted connections are used for
   network directories; therefore, the plus sign appears until the directory is
   accessed. Floppy drives display a plus sign because it is time consuming to
   poll floppy drives until you want to access them.

 - In Windows 3.x and Windows for Workgroups 3.x, the plus and minus signs are
   enabled by default for File Manager. In Windows 95, they are disabled by
   default.

RESOLUTION
==========

 - If you click the plus sign, it disappears if there are no subdirectories. If
   there are subdirectories, clicking the plus sign makes the subdirectories
   visible.

 - On the Tree menu in File Manager, click Indicate Expandable Branches to view
   the plus and minus signs in File Manager.
