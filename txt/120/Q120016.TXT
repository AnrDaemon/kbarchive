TITLE   :TCP/IP-32: ARP -S Switch Fails on First Entry Added to ARP Cache
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER::3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

With Microsoft TCP/IP-32, when you attempt to add the first Address Resolution
Protocol (arp) entry into an empty arp cache using the arp -s switch, it will
appear to function correctly, but the entry will fail to load if you provide
only the first two parameters. For example, when you execute the command:

   arp -s 22.101.33.237 08-00-2b-2e-98-b3

it will appear to have been added, but when you interogate the protocol data by
executing the command:

   ARP -a

you will receive no results, indicating the arp cache is still empty.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can work around this problem by providing all three of the arp -s parameters
when adding an initial entry into an empty arp cache.

After the following complete arp -s initial arp cache entry:

   arp -s 22.101.33.236 08-00-2b-30-d1-e0 22.101.33.237

the following results would be reported from the arp cache using arp -a:

Interface: 22.101.33.237

  Internet Address       Physical Address          Type
  22.101.33.236          08-00-2b-30-d1-e0         Static

NOTE: To get a complete description of arp switches and parameters, at the
command prompt type "arp" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS TCP/IP-32. We are researching
this problem and will post new information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
