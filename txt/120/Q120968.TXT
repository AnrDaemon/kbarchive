======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Disabling a warning with #pragma warning will not succeed if the pragma is
placed within the function where the warning occurs and the warning has a value
of 4700 or greater.

CAUSE
=====

Warnings greater than 4699 are generated by the second and third passes of the
compiler.

RESOLUTION
==========

To disable warnings with a value of 4700 or greater, place the #pragma warning
outside of any function.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sample Code
-----------

The following sample code demonstrates the problem:

   /* Compile options needed: /W4
   */ 

   float big;
   float big2;
   int junk1;

   /* Use this pragma instead of the one below to disable all
   warnings     */ 
   /* #pragma
   warning(disable:4756;disable:4706;disable:4699;disable:4244)
   */ 

   void main(void)
   {
      int i;

   /* This pragma will disable only the warnings < 4699 because
   of its placement within the function body */ 

   #pragma
   warning(disable:4756;disable:4706;disable:4699;disable:4244)

      big = +1.0e+99;
      big2 = +1.1e+99;
      junk1 = i;
      if( i=0 )
         i=0;
   }
