TITLE   :Step-Up Runs MAKESYS but Fails SETUP w/Insufficient Memory Err
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the MS-DOS 6.22 MAKESYS command is run, an area of memory exists in which
Step-Up runs MAKESYS and then subsequently fails when SETUP is called. Errors
indicating that there is insufficient memory to run the MAKESYS-invoked SETUP
portion can occur even though the MAKESYS portion ran without generating any
errors.

CAUSE
=====

Before starting, MAKESYS ensures that its own memory requirement (a minimum of
171 kilobytes [K] available memory) is met. MAKESYS does NOT ensure that there
is enough available memory to run the SETUP portion. SETUP fails unless at least
386K of memory is available.


RESOLUTION
==========

Because the SETUP portion has a higher available-memory requirement than
MAKESYS, be sure to run a memory check before you run MAKESYS. Run the MEM
command to check available memory. Make sure that at least 386K of available
memory exists before you try to run MAKESYS.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS version 6.22. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
