TITLE   :Error Message: Bad or Missing Command Interpreter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you restart your computer, you may receive the following error message:

   Bad or missing Command Interpreter
   Enter name of Command Interpreter (for example, C:\Windows\Command.com)

CAUSE
=====

This error message can occur when the Windows 95 or the MS-DOS command
interpreter (COMMAND.COM) is missing or has become corrupted.

The Windows 95 COMMAND.COM file is renamed COMMAND.W40 when the system is booted
to a previous version of MS-DOS. If this file is corrupted or missing, the above
error message appears when you start Windows 95 normally.

The MS-DOS COMMAND.COM file is renamed COMMAND.DOS when the system is booted into
Windows 95. If this file is corrupted or missing, the above error message
appears when you bypass the normal Windows 95 startup by pressing either the F4
or the F8 key at the Starting Windows message.

Note that the Junkie virus is known to infect the COMMAND.COM and WIN.COM files.
When the COMMAND.COM file is infected, its file size increases to 93,187 or
93,907 bytes.

RESOLUTION
==========

To restore the Windows 95 operating system and make the disk bootable, follow
these steps:

1. Start your computer with the Startup Disk created during Setup.

2. Make a backup copy of the current MSDOS.SYS file by typing the following
   lines at the command prompt:

   " c:
   cd\windows\command
   attrib c:\msdos.sys -r -s -h
   ren c:\msdos.sys msdos.xxx " (without the quotation marks)

3. Use the SYS command from the Startup Disk to transfer the system files to the
   hard disk by typing the following lines at the command prompt:

   " a:
   sys c: " (without the quotation marks)

4. Replace the new MSDOS.SYS file with the backup copy by typing the following
   lines at the command prompt:

   " c:
   cd\windows\command
   attrib c:\msdos.sys -r -s -h
   del c:\msdos.sys
   ren c:\msdos.xxx msdos.sys
   attrib c:\msdos.sys +r +s +h " (without the quotation marks)

5. Shut down and restart the computer.
