TITLE   :FIX: .IF with Multiple Tests Adds a JMP Instruction
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::6.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 6.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If two or more values known at assembly time evaluate as TRUE, .IF (below) will
add a JMP instruction. In this first example, only the NOP is assembled:

      .IF 1
         nop
      .ENDIF

In this second example, a JMP instruction is added:

      .IF 1 || 3
         nop
      .ENDIF

If you use a register, as in this third example, the result is a conditional JMP
to the location following the .IF:

      .IF ax || 3
         nop
      .ENDIF

The code runs as expected, despite the extra instructions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To eliminate the extra generated code, replace the "||" with an "OR".

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in MASM version 6.1. This problem was
corrected in MASM version 6.11.
