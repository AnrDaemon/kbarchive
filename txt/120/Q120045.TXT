TITLE   :BUG: Value of cbDSN in SQLConnect is Not Mapped Correctly
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbBug kbISS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 2.0

BUG# ODBCSDK2: 2693 (2.0)

SYMPTOMS
========

When connecting from a 16-bit application to a certain 32-bit driver in a
Microsoft Windows NT environment, you may receive an error from the driver about
incorrect parameter or argument value. This does not happen when SQLConnect is
called from a 32-bit application to a 32-bit driver or from a 16-bit application
to a 16-bit driver.

For example, assume that the datasource name is "DsnName" with cbDSN=8. Then, the
following calls show the behavior:

      //Allocate environment handle
         SQLAllocEnv(phenv);
      //Allocate connection handle
         SQLAllocConnect(henv,phdbc);
      //Specify szDSN="DsnName" and cbDSN= length of ("DsnName")=8
         SQLConnect(hdbc,"DsnName",8,szUID,cbUID,szAuthStr,cbAuthStr);

In looking at the ODBC trace using 32-bit ODBC Spy, you will find that the value
of cbDSN passed is not 8, but a large number (0x3a43).

CAUSE
=====

When connecting from a 16-bit application to a 32-bit driver, the value of cbDSN
in SQLConnect is not correctly passed and is mapped to a large value. However,
the values of cbUID and cbAuthStr are passed correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in ODBC Driver Manager version 2.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
