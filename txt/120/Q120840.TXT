TITLE   :PRB: Setup Does Not Detect Existing FoxPro Installation
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.6a,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.6a 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Setup program prompts you to install FoxPro, rather than running in
maintenance mode to modify an existing FoxPro installation.

CAUSE
=====

FoxPro is installed on a hard disk (volume) other than the boot disk. The setup
program only checks the boot disk for an existing FoxPro installation.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When FoxPro is installed on the boot disk, the FoxPro Setup program starts in
maintenance mode, prompting you to add or remove components of your current
installation, reinstall FoxPro, or remove all FoxPro components of the current
FoxPro installation.
