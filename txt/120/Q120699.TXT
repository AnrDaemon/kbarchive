-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Space Simulator for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If it is necessary to perform a manual setup; the planetary system for the star
Betelgeuse will not be installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The FINISH.BAT file that automates much of the manual installation process has a
typo in the batch file. As a result, one of the planetary texture files,
S10DATA.EXE is not expanded properly. However, even though it has not been
expanded, the file will be automatically deleted at the end of the manual
installation process.

NOTE: This will not affect Space Simulator's performance. The program will
operate normally in all respects except there will be no planets available for
the star Betelgeuse.

Workaround
----------

1. Copy the contents of the disks to a directory on the hard drive.

2. Run the DISK1.EXE file from your hard drive.

3. Using a text editor such as the MS-DOS Edit utility, open the file
   FINISH.BAT, which was decompressed from the DISK1.EXE file.

4. Locate the line that reads:

      S10ATA.EXE

5. Modify the line so that it reads:

      S10DATA.EXE

6. Save the changes and exit the editor.

7. Complete the manual installation by running the FINISH.BAT file, and
   following the on-screen prompts in the Setup utility.

Space Simulator will now be installed completely.
