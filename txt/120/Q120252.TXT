======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Multimedia Viewer Publishing Toolkit, versions 2.0, 2.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running the following Microsoft Multimedia Viewer Publishing Toolkit Setup
command to install a title, you encounter this error: "Setup has encountered a
problem. Please report File='INSTALL\INICM.C', Line='185' to Microsoft Product
Support Services."

   \MVPUBKIT\MVSAMPLE\PROGSAMP\SETUP\USA\SETUP.EXE

CAUSE
=====

SETUP.EXE uses the TITLE.MST file in the same directory for directions on how to
install the title. TITLE.MST has seven variables. The values for all seven
variables must be set by the author of the Viewer title. These variables contain
information such as the name of the Viewer title and the destination directory
for the title. If any of these variables are not initialized, SETUP.EXE will
report an error in INICM.C.

RESOLUTION
==========

The first 85 lines of TITLE.MST contain comments with instructions on how to
initialize the seven variables.
