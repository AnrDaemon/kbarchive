SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to install a MediaVision Pro Audio Spectrum 16-bit (PAS16) sound
card (with the Trantor SCSI adapter) in a DELL Omniplex 560 (with an NCR810 SCSI
controller for the internal C disk), you receive the following STOP Message on
the first boot:

   STOP: INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE.
   Remove the MV PAS16 card. Install. Re-insert the card.

CAUSE
=====

On the first boot of install, Windows NT automatic hardware detection looks for
the boot device on the Trantor SCSI controller on the PAS16 card, cannot find
it, and freezes. On later reboots, Windows NT has recorded in the registry that
the NCR SCSI has the boot device, so it does not perform the auto-detection that
causes the stop message.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Remove the MediaVision PAS16 card.

2. Install Windows NT.

3. Shutdown.

4. Re-insert the card.

5. Reboot.

6. Use the Control Panel's Drivers option to activate the PAS16 card.
