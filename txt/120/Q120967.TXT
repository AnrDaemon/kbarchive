======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 2.0, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A try block within a switch statement may cause the exception to be handled
incorrectly, as illustrated by the sample code in the MORE INFORMATION section
below.

CAUSE
=====

The compiler doesn't recognize catch blocks within the switch statement.
Therefore, the compiler attempts to link the try block to the next catch block
outside the switch. In the sample code in the More Information section below,
the second catch block is executed after the exception is thrown.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sample Code
-----------

The following sample code demonstrates the problem:

   /* Compile options needed: /GX
   */ 

   #include <stdio.h>

   void main(void)
   {
      int i = 0;

      try
      {
         switch ( i )
         try
         {
            case 0:
               throw i;
         }
         catch( int )
         {
         /* Should be caught here but isn't */ 
            printf( "Passed.\n" );
         }
      }
      catch (...)
      {
      /* Is caught here incorrectly */ 
         printf( "Failed.\n" );
      }
   }
