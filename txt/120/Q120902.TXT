KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set the properties of a Windows-based executable file, you cannot
specify the working directory.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 is designed to behave this way because the executable file must be
preserved in its original format so that links assigned to it can rely on stable
(unchanging) data.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you create a link or shortcut to the original executable file, you can then
specify the working directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Moving the original executable to the working directory is NOT recommended
because other links may be dependent upon its current directory.

NOTE: MS-DOS-based applications use program information files (.PIFs); therefore,
you can specify a working directory for them using their properties.

Additional query words: COM EXE BAT
