-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot insert a Paintbrush OLE object into SQLWindows.

CAUSE
=====

The KRNL286.EXE that is run on non-80x86 architectures (primarily RISC) cannot
handle OLE objects that require more than 1 MB of memory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Reduce the size of the Paintbrush object before inserting it, until the memory
requirement for it is less than 1 MB. KRNL286.EXE can then handle it.
