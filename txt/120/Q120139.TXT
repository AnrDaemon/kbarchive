TITLE   :Cannot Interactively Boot Windows 95 with Hardcard Drives
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you press the F8 key at the "Starting Windows" message or choose Previous
Operating System from the Windows Startup menu, Windows 95 still loads.

CAUSE
=====

If a hard disk drive requires that device drivers (such as a hardcard driver)
load from the CONFIG.SYS file, an interactive boot is not possible. Such devices
are read-only until their drivers are loaded.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this situation, use a system disk from the previous operating
system and boot from the floppy disk drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Most hardcards must load drivers from the CONFIG.SYS file to provide read and
write capabilities. If these device drivers do not load, you can only read
information from the hard disk. Without the ability to write information to the
hard disk, Windows 95 cannot rename the CONFIG.DOS, AUTOEXEC.DOS, IO.DOS, and
MSDOS.DOS files to boot to MS-DOS. (Other operating systems may use different
filenames.) This forces Windows 95 to boot using the Windows 95 IO.SYS file.
Because the file-rename process occurs before the CONFIG.SYS file is read, the
device drivers are not yet loaded; therefore, the files cannot be renamed.

Additional query words: plusdrv.sys atdoshc2.sys atdosxl.sys plus quantum development hard card
