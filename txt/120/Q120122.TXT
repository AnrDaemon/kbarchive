TITLE   :Network DDE Applications Fail with TCP/IP-32
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.11

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Network DDE Windows-based applications (like File Manager) fail to operate
successfully between Windows for Workgroups workstations configured with
TCP/IP-32 when they are in different sub-nets connected by routers. The
following error message appears:

   The computer name specified in the network path cannot be located

You can observe workstations with a protocol analyzer. Unsuccessful Name Query
requests broadcasted to the local sub-net are transmitted by workstations to
resolve the name of the workstation in question: "computername <1F>".

The NET USE command functions correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The NetBIOS naming table on the workstation does not include the name required
by Network DDE for computer names specified in the LMHOSTS file. This problem
only occurs under TCP/IP-32 if you use the #PRE keyword.

When a name entry is parsed from the LMHOSTS file, three entries are added to the
workstation's NetBIOS naming table. These are added to provide the computer
name, messenger, and server functionality:

   computername   00h
   computername   20h
   computername   03h

RESOLUTION
==========

TCP/IP-16 Real Mode
-------------------

Use the ADDNAME2 keyword available from the LAN Manager resource kit. The
following syntax adds an additional entry which can then be saved to the LMHOSTS
file:

   addname2 "computername   " /p0x1f

The entire length of the name must be 16 characters including the hidden
character (1f) in the 16th place. You must pad the computer name with spaces so
that it equals 15 characters in length.

TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups 3.11
-----------------------------------------

TCP/IP-32 can add the required NetBIOS name (if you are using the #PRE keyword)
by having the two following lines in the LMHOSTS file of each remote computer:

   ipaddr computername #PRE
   ipaddr "COMPUTERNAME   \0x1F" #PRE

NOTE: The computer name in quotation marks on the second entry must equal 16
characters in length, and it must be in uppercase. The #PRE keyword is optional
for the second entry above. #PRE speeds up resolution of the Network DDE name
which helps to provide a successful connection accross routers providing a
dialup or delayed remote link.
