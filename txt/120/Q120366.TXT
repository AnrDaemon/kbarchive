SUMMARY
=======

The Disk Tools floppy disk, included with the Macintosh System 7.1 package, is a
bootable disk.

You can boot from it directly, or use it to make a new bootable floppy disk by
copying its System Folder to the new floppy disk.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the process of troubleshooting problems on the Macintosh, you may need to
make changes to the System Folder. As a precautionary measure, you should have a
bootable floppy disk ready beforehand.

NOTE: If you have any INITs or CDEVs necessary to run your Macintosh, be sure to
copy them to the System Folder on the newly created bootable floppy disk. You
should not make any changes to the Disk Tools floppy disk.

Steps to Copy the Disk Tools' System Folder to Another Floppy Disk
------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Insert a blank floppy disk in the disk drive. A floppy disk icon will appear
   on the desktop, labeled Untitled (unless the floppy disk has been given a
   different name).

2. From the Special menu, choose Eject Disk. Note that the Untitled floppy disk
   remains on the desktop and becomes gray.

3. Slide the write-protect tab open on the Disk Tools disk, then insert it into
   the floppy disk drive. When the Disk Tools icon appears on the desktop,
   double-click it to open its window.

4. Drag the System Folder from the Disk Tools window to the Untitled disk icon.

5. You may be prompted multiple times to insert the Untitled or Disk Tools disks
   as the files are copied. Insert the appropriate disk as instructed until the
   System Folder has been copied.

6. Drag the Disk Tools icon to the Trash icon to remove it from the desktop.

7. Drag the Untitled icon to the Trash icon to eject it from the disk drive.

The Untitled floppy disk is now bootable. To boot from it, turn off the
Macintosh, insert the disk in the drive, then turn the Macintosh on.
