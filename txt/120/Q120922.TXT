The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 2.0, on platform(s):
    - the hardware: Intel x86 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following is based on the Visual C++ version 2.0 README.WRI file:

SDK Requirements for National Language Support
----------------------------------------------

Visual C++ version 2.0 correctly handles all multibyte-character set (MBCS)
issues, including use of Input Method Editors (IME). However, to enable MBCS
behavior for the development environment and build tools, you must develop on
the appropriate MBCS platform, namely, with Windows NT "Daytona" for Japan,
Korea, Taiwan, or the People's Republic of China. The Windows NT "Daytona" SDK
and the Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) SDK included with Visual C++ version
2.0 do not include MBCS-enabled libraries or header files. To use the
MBCS-enabled versions of these Windows APIs, you must use the Windows NT SDK and
ODBC libraries and header files for the appropriate country/region.

Help Files With Japanese DBCS Characters
----------------------------------------

In order to build help files with Visual C++ version 2.0 that contain Japanese
double-byte (DBCS) characters, you must replace the installed versions of the
help file components with those found on the CD-ROM disk in the
\MSVC20\BIN\HELP.JP directory. Replace the following files:

HC30.EXE
HC31.EXE
HC31.ERR
HC.BAT

NOTE: These help compilers, while DBCS-enabled, do not work on .RTF files created
with Microsoft Word version 6.0.

Additional query words: 2.00
