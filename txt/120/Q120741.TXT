-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Services For Macintosh (SFM) version 3.1, then change the drive
letter of the drive that NT is installed on, the MacFile control panel applet no
longer appears in File Manager. This can also happen if you upgrade by
installing Windows NT version 3.5 over Windows NT version 3.1 and the drive
letters had been changed the same way.

CAUSE
=====

In Windows NT 3.1 the path to the .CPL file for the MacFile menu item was hard
coded to the system root directory:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\
   FileManager\AddOns\AfpManager: REG_SZ: E:\NTS612\System32\sfmmgr.cpl
   (in this example E:\NTS612 is where Windows NT 3.1 was installed)

Changing the drive letter renders this path invalid.

RESOLUTION
==========

In Windows NT version 3.5 the path is not hard coded in the registry. Edit it to
read as shown below using REGEDT32.EXE:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\
   FileManager\AddOns\Afp Manager: REG_SZ: sfmmgr.cpl

   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
   problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
   Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
   Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.1. This
problem has been corrected in Windows NT version 3.5.
