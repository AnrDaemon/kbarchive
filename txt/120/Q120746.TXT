The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT Workstation or Server version 3.5 on a computer
where Disk Administrator has been used to assign non-default drive letters to
externally connected disks, Windows NT installation offers only the default
drive letters as options on which to install the system, NOT the assigned
letters. The volume labels are listed correctly.

CAUSE
=====

During initial installation, the complete file system is not yet installed, so
assigned disk letters are unavailable.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use volume labels (which the installation software lists correctly) instead of
disk letters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
