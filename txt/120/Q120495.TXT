SUMMARY
=======

To prevent a bitmap image from flashing or becoming distorted when a video clip
is played or another bitmap is displayed at the same time, you can change the
palette of the bitmap image.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Graphic images that use different palettes can be modified to use a common one.
This prevents screen flashing and/or distortion from occurring when you view
multiple files. To do this:

1. Copy the palette (or the image that contains the palette) you want to use to
   the Clipboard. For example, in Media Player, open the desired file, and then
   choose Copy from the Edit menu.

2. Open the bitmap file in BitEdit. From the Edit menu, choose Paste Palette to
   paste the new palette into the bitmap image.

You can now save the change to the existing file or to a new filename. Use this
procedure to copy the desired palette to all images that are displayed
simultaneously.

NOTE: The new palette permanently changes the appearance of the bitmap image.
