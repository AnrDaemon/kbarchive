SUMMARY
=======

Although you can use WinPopup to send messages to someone using NWPOPUP, there
are some limitations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 95 lets you run the client for Windows networks (VREDIR) and the Client
for NetWare networks (NWREDIR) together. If you send a message using WinPopup,
VREDIR handles the request. In the event that VREDIR fails, WinPopup attempts to
send the pop-up message to everyone on your preferred or default NetWare
server.

The fact that the recipient must be on your preferred server is one of the
limitations. The other limitation is that the message cannot exceed 38
characters.

Novell NetWare is manufactured by Novell, Inc., a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
