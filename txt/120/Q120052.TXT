TITLE   :NBT Query Can Hang Computer or Drop Back to MS-DOS
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER::3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Your computer running Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 with TCP/IP-32 network
protocol stops responding (hangs) or drops back to MS-DOS when the 32-bit
NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT) makes a query to the Domain Name Service (DNS).

CAUSE
=====

The buffer allocated for the DNS name query in 32-bit NBT is one byte too short.
The code that creates the DNS name query does not count the length byte of the
domain name and allocates a buffer that is one byte short.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has released a new file, VNBT.386, that corrects this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in TCP/IP-32. This problem has been
corrected in an updated TCP/IP-32 version 3.11a. For information on the
availability of TCP/IP-32 3.11a, see article Q122544 in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base.
