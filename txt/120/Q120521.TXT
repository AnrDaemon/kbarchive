KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you remove Windows components using the Windows Setup program, the Windows
Setup screen shifts to the background after you remove the component. When you
try to bring Windows Setup to the foreground or double- click the Windows Setup
icon in Task Manager, Windows appears to stop responding (hang). Windows Setup
may not return control from several minutes.

NOTES:

 - This behavior does not occur when you are reinstalling Windows components.

 - The screen savers or wallpapers that you selected to remove are indeed
   removed from the hard disk.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups 3.11. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
