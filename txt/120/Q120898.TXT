The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22

SUMMARY
=======

File Manager and the MS-DOS Shell may report 128 megabytes (MB) as the total
size of a CD-ROM and zero (0) MB as the amount of free space. This occurs
because the Microsoft CD-ROM Extensions (MSCDEX) reports 128 MB as the capacity
of a CD regardless of the real capacity or true remaining free space on the CD.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MSCDEX reports 128 MB for the MS-DOS DISK INFO function call. This MS-DOS API is
used by File Manager and Shell. Although it is not difficult to find the
capacity of a CD-ROM, MSCDEX does not use this information. MSCDEX reports a
total of 65,535 clusters of 2 kilobytes each and 0 free clusters.
