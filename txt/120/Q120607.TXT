TITLE   :Cannot Browse If No SMB Server Exists in Your Workgroup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You can browse only Novell NetWare servers in your workgroup.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 does not support browsing in a workgroup that does not contain an SMB
server.

RESOLUTION
==========

If your workstation is in a workgroup containing no SMB servers, follow these
steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Network icon.

3. Click the Identification tab.

4. In the Workgroup box, enter the name of a workgroup that contains an SMB
   server.

5. Click OK.

These steps enable you to browse SMB servers in other workgroups.

Note that this creates two workgroups with the same name in Network Neighborhood.
One workgroup displays "Microsoft file and print" and the other displays
"Microsoft file and print services for NetWare."
