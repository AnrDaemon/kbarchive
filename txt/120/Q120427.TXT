The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5

SYMPTOMS
========

The edges or hairline borders around charts, graphs or graphic images in Quattro
Pro spreadsheets do not print on 300 dpi PostScript printers. They may print
with reduced width on 600 dpi (or better) PostScript printers. Complete images
print to non-PostScript printers.

CAUSE
=====

PostScript does not deal with clipping properly in the GDI model. GDI is
inclusive/exclusive while PostScript is inclusive/inclusive. In a rectangle from
(1,1) to (2,2), GDI lights the pels at (1,1) only. PostScript would light the
pels at (1,1), (1,2), (2,1) and (2,2).

Quattro Pro generates a clipping region by creating a very large rectangle,
intersecting it with the desired drawing area, then using a series of PatBlt's
to output the edges with very precise coordinates. The difference in clipping
between GDI and PostScript makes some of the lines (pels) disappear.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
