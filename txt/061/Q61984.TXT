SUMMARY
=======

LAN Manager applications should be linked with libraries that contain the LAN
Manager API functions. These functions reside in static-link or dynamic-link
libraries (DLLs). The type of link library used depends on the operating system
used by the application (MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows version 3.0, or Microsoft
OS/2 version 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3).

LAN Manager operates in similar ways with OS/2, MS-DOS, and Windows, although the
operating system allows more functionality when LAN Manager operates with
Microsoft OS/2. OS/2 supports multiple program threads and all LAN Manager
services; when installed with HPFS, OS/2 also supports long filenames. MS-DOS
and Windows support only one program thread, FAT "8.3" filenames, and the
Messenger, Netpopup, and Workstation services.

In systems with MS-DOS, the LAN Manager API functions reside in the static-link
library DOSLAN.LIB. MS-DOS applications are linked with static-link libraries in
one step at link time. Only one library is needed.

In systems with OS/2 and Windows, the LAN Manager API functions reside in the DLL
file. More than one link library may be needed for these operating-system
platforms, depending on the platform and the LAN Manager API functions called by
the application. The Print category API functions reside in the PMSPL library;
all other API functions reside in the LAN library. The following is a list of
the link libraries:

   Platform       Import Library      Dynamic-Link Library
   --------       --------------      --------------------

   MS OS/2 1.2+   LAN.LIB             MAILSLOT.DLL, NETOEM.DLL
                  PMSPL.LIB           PMSPL.DLL, NETAPI.DLL

   MS OS/2 1.1    LAN.LIB             MAILSLOT.DLL, NETOEM.DLL
                  NETSPOOL.LIB        NETSPOOL.DLL, NETAPI.DLL

   Windows 3.0    LAN.LIB             NETAPI.DLL
                  PMSPL.LIB           PMSPL.DLL

   MS-DOS         DOSLAN.LIB

Note: Microsoft OS/2 and Windows do not use the same PMSPL and LAN files.
