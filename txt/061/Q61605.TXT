======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS, versions 5.01.21, 5.02, 5.03, 5.05, 5.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The EXPORT statement used in module definition (.DEF) files is incorrectly
documented in several places with the last two parameters reversed. The "pwords"
parameter should be the last parameter, but it is listed second from the end.
The "NODATA" parameter is listed last, but should be second from the end. The
correct EXPORT statement syntax is as follows:

      entryname [=internalname] [@ord[RESIDENTNAME]] [NODATA] [pwords]

Note that the "pwords" parameter is listed as "iopl-parmwords" in some of the
documentation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The documentation with the incorrect EXPORT statement syntax with reversed
parameters is as follows:

 - The C versions 6.0 and 6.0a online help for LINK under the EXPORT statement
   syntax

 - On page 334 of "The Microsoft CodeView and Utilities User's Guide" for
   version 2.3 in Section 19.9, "The EXPORTS Statement" (shipped with FORTRAN
   5.0 and BASIC PDS 7.0)

 - On page Update-52 of "The Microsoft CodeView and Utilities Update" for
   version 2.2 in Section 7.8, "The EXPORTS Statement" (shipped with C 5.1, MASM
   5.1, and Pascal 4.0)

LINK version 5.13 (shipped with MASM 6.0) was corrected.
