TITLE   :FIX: PWB 1.0 Requires Decimal Value for Stack Size LINK Option

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) version 1.0, there is a problem with
changing a program's stack size in some situations. When specifying the stack
size in the Link Options dialog box (from the Options menu), you must enter the
value in the form of a decimal integer. Although the Help menu tells you this
field accepts positive integers in octal and hexadecimal form, PWB 1.00 will not
accept them.

CAUSE
=====

When an octal or hexadecimal value is entered in the stack-size field, any
digits specified as A-F are discarded and replaced by 0 (zero). If digits
precede a letter, the digits are retained and the letters are discarded.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in PWB version 1.0. This problem
was corrected in PWB version 1.1.
