SUMMARY
=======

You should not start the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) by typing PWBED. This is
incorrect. Type PWB to start the Programmer's WorkBench environment.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the REAL MODE directory specified during setup, there will be two executables
for the PWB, PWB.COM and PWBED.EXE. PWB.COM actually spawns PWBED.EXE. If you
use PWBED to start the PWB, it will consume approximately 500K of memory. By
executing a DOS SHELL from within the PWB and running CHKDSK, you will notice
there is very little memory left.

When you invoke the PWB the correct way (by typing PWB), then shell- out and do a
CHKDSK, you will see that the PWB has only consumed approximately 8K of
available memory.

The PWB appears to work correctly if you invoke it with PWBED. However, since it
is using so much memory, you will receive memory problems, such as "out of
memory," "cannot compile," "cannot build," "program too big to fit in memory,"
and "could not execute C1.EXE." These are caused because there is not enough
memory to spawn either NMAKE, the compiler, or the linker.
