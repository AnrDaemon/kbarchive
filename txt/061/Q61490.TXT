SUMMARY
=======

The notifier options in Microsoft Mail conflict with Claris products. When a
Mail message is received while using MacWrite and Claris CAD, the Macintosh
hangs. If you are in MacDraw II, you will not receive notification of new mail
regardless of your preferences.

Microsoft and Claris are both researching this problem and will post new
information here as it becomes available.

To avoid this problem, turn off all notifier preferences and do not attempt to
read your mail while using a Claris product.
