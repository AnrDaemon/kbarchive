SYMPTOMS
========

In the Programmer's Workbench (PWB) version 1.0, it has been observed that
certain unusual editing sequences can cause the following errors:

In MS-DOS:

   Run-time error R6003 - integer divide by 0

In OS/2:

   SYS1943 protection violation, trap number 13

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in PWB version 1.0. This problem
was corrected in PWB version 1.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sequences reproduce the errors:

   Select Linker options.                L
   Select Set Debug Options.             ALT+G
   Pull up help on the options.          F1
