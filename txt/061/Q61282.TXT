SUMMARY
=======

The instructions for installing the Microsoft Mail workstation files involve
using the Microsoft Mail Workstation Installer disk as the start-up disk on the
workstation. When following this procedure on the Macintosh Portable, Classic,
LC, IIci, IIfx, and IIsi, the machine may crash, displaying the sad Macintosh
icon.

The System on the Microsoft Mail Workstation Installer disk is version 6.0.3 (or
6.0.2 if purchased before January 1990). This version of the System software
does not support the above Macintoshes. To install the Microsoft Mail
workstation files, you must start up (boot) from the start-up disk provided with
the Macintosh. You can then drag the "MS Mail 2.0" driver into the System Folder
and use the Font/DA Mover to install the "Microsoft Mail 2.0" desk accessory
(DA).

This problem was addressed in Microsoft Mail version 3.0. The Workstation
Installer for Mail 3.0 does not require using the Workstation disk as the
start-up disk.
