The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.1 
 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an option is added to the TOOLS.INI file under the PWB tag to read either
"Edit:yes" or "Edit:no", PWB returns the following error message:

   Edit is not an editor switch.

CAUSE
=====

The edit switch for the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB), documented on page 79 of
the Microsoft C version 6.0 "Microsoft C Reference" manual, is not implemented
in PWB versions 1.0 and 1.1. The documentation is incorrect.

RESOLUTION
==========

To open a file as read only, invoke PWB with the /r option.
