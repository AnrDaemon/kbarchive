The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to install the SMARTDrive disk-caching utility that comes with
Microsoft Windows on a machine with no local hard drive, you may receive the
following message when you boot your computer:

   No hard drives on system

CAUSE
=====

Setting up SMARTDrive on a diskless workstation on a network is a typical
configuration that could cause this problem. Since the network software is not
loaded until after you've booted up, SMARTDrive does not see any hard drives. As
a result, it returns the error message.
