SUMMARY
=======

Sets of supplemental flight maps are available for Flight Simulator versions
3.00 and 4.00 that detail six major flight areas: New York, Boston, Chicago,
Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.

The maps for Flight Simulator version 4.00 include frequencies and locations for
nondirectional radio beacons (NDB) and have the Microsoft Flight Simulator logo
imprinted in their lower-left corner.

The maps for version 3.00 do not include either the logo or the frequencies and
locations for the nondirectional radio beacons.

The version 4.00 maps can be obtained by sending in the coupon included in the
Flight Simulator package or by calling Microsoft Customer Service at (800)
426-9400.
