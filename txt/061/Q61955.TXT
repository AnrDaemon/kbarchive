-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under OS/2, if MSHELP.DLL is not installed correctly or is not on the
LIBPATH, an error such as the following may appear in a window when
starting the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB):

   Cannot Autoload Extension
   e:\c600\binp\pwbhelp.pxt

   MSHELP: SYS0002: The system cannot find the file specified

   < OK > < Help >

 
Make sure that the latest version of MSHELP.DLL (the one that was
included with the package in which you obtained PWB) is installed in a
directory contained in your LIBPATH.

The default for OS/2 DLLs is the C:\OS2\DLL directory. If you choose
to install the DLLs in some other directory, you must edit the LIBPATH
in your CONFIG.SYS file and restart the system.

Additional query words: kbinf 1.00 1.10 PWBIss
