SUMMARY
=======

The superscript and subscript formats that are applied to text using the
predefined key combinations automatically raise or reduce the font size of the
selected text. To create easy-to-apply custom superscript and subscript formats,
use the appropriate method for your version of Word.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The predefined key combinations for superscript and subscript are as follows:

 - Superscript CTRL+SHIFT++ (Plus Sign)
 - Subscript CTRL+= (Equal Sign)

Because the predefined key combinations cannot be assigned to a specific point
position, use the following process to assign key combinations to different
character positions:

1. On the Tools menu, click Customize.

2. Click the Commands tab.

3. Click Keyboard.

4. In the Customize Keyboard dialog box, under Categories, select Format.

   Under Commands, select Raised (for superscript position) or Lowered (for
   subscript position).

5. Change the number in the Raised (or Lowered) list to the scripting height you
   want (for example, 5 pt).

6. Click in the "Press new shortcut key" text box, and press a key combination
   (press the keys simultaneously).

7. Click Assign to assign the key to the selected scripting height command.
