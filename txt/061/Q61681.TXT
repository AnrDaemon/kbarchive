SUMMARY
=======

When FASTOPEN is loaded and the BASIC program listed below is executed, a "Disk
full" error occurs. When FASTOPEN is not loaded, this error does not occur.

The following BASIC program creates a random file with a size of 64 MB, and then
asks for a "START" and an "END" record within the file to write the records
between "START" and "END":

   OPEN "TESTDAT" FOR RANDOM AS #1 LEN = 1024
   CLS
   PRINT "************** Write into TESTDAT 1024 - Byte Records *********"
   PRINT
   INPUT "Start writing at record:"; START
   INPUT "Stop writing at record :"; FINAL
   FIELD #1, 1024 AS A$
   LSET A$ = STRING$(1024, "H")
   FOR I = START TO FINAL
           PUT 1, 65539
           PUT 1, I
           LOCATE 10, 10
           PRINT I
           IF INKEY$ = CHR$(27) THEN EXIT FOR
   NEXT I
   CLOSE
   END

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS versions 4.01 and 5.0. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.
