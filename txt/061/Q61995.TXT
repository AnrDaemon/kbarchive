SUMMARY
=======

Files and/or directories you create when shelled out of MS-DOS Shell will not
display when you exit back to Shell. To have Shell display the file created at
the DOS prompt, place the cursor over the drive letter to select the drive where
the file or directories were created. This will force the Shell to reread the
drive information.

If using MS-DOS version 5.0, you can also force the DOSSHELL to reread a disk by
choosing the Refresh option under the View menu or pressing F5. The current
directory can be reread by pressing <ctrl-F5>.

When you shell out to the command prompt from Shell, a temporary file is created
to store status information while you are shelled out. Returning to Shell by
typing "exit" (without the quotation marks) at the command prompt causes Shell
to read this status information. This temporary file will not reflect any
changes made at the command prompt.

For more information on this process, query in this knowledge base on the
following words:

   " dosshell and temporary and files " (without the quotation marks)
