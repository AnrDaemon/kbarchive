SUMMARY
=======

When using the Source Browser functionality within the Programmer's WorkBench
(PWB) versions 1.0 and 1.1, you can expect to have zero-length .SBR files on
your disk. This is by design of the PWBRMAKE utility.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PWBRMAKE.EXE is a utility that converts the .SBR files created by the compiler
for each program module into a single database file that can be read by the
Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) Source Browser. The resulting Source Browser
database file has the extension .BSC.

When a Source Browser database (a .BSC file) is built from .SBR files, the .SBR
files are truncated to zero length to save disk space since they can be quite
large. .SBR files are truncated to zero length, rather than being deleted,
because PWBRMAKE performs incremental updates to the database and, therefore,
needs the time and date stamp from the files.

When you rebuild part of your project, new .SBR files are built for those
modules. Each .SBR file that has not been re-created during a build is included
as a zero-length file. This tells PWBRMAKE that the file has no new contribution
to make to the database, so no update of that part of the database is required.
