TITLE   :FIX: U1001 w/ Corrupted MAKEDIR Macro in Real Mode NMAKE 1.11
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:1.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft NMAKE Utility for MS-DOS, version 1.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

NMAKE version 1.11 may produce a U1001 "syntax error: illegal character
<character> in macro" while building a project because of a problem with
the MAKEDIR macro. The problem occurs only with the DOS version of NMAKE 1.11
and not the protected mode version.

CAUSE
=====

NMAKE has an internal macro, MAKEDIR, which contains the full drive and path to
the directory from where NMAKE was invoked. This macro is corrupted in NMAKE
version 1.11 under DOS. Rather than the correct pathname, the macro contains
"garbage" or graphics characters. This macro can cause the U1001 "illegal
character" error message.

To display the contents of MAKEDIR, invoke NMAKE with the /P switch. This switch
causes all macros to be displayed to the screen.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, manually set MAKEDIR in the .MAK file for the
project. Set it to the drive and path where the project is being built. If
MAKEDIR is manually set in the .MAK file, it will override the default setting
and correct the problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in NMAKE version 1.11. This problem
was corrected in NMAKE version 1.12.
