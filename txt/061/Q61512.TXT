The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If a msmail function is used with the "put" command without an "into
<container>", the message box containing the result of the function will
appear. For example, the following command

      put msmail(getmessagelist)

will cause the message box to appear. However, the following command

      put msmail(getmessagelist) into data

will not.

This feature of HyperCard can be used for debugging purposes.

For more information on this behavior, examine the script in the "Out of Office"
stack. This script works around this problem and supplies error checking at the
same time.

For more information on HyperCard in general, see "The HyperTalk Beginner's
Guide" supplied with the program, or Microsoft Press's "Programmer's Quick
Reference Guide to HyperTalk."
