The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit (SDK) for HyperCard, versions 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When a script is run, if HyperCard gives the error message "Can't understand
msmail," this means that the function needs a verb in front of it, as follows:

   put msmail(....
   get msmail(...
   add msmail(....

A line can't begin with

   msmail(....

MORE INFORMATION
================

The function msmail takes its arguments and returns a mailresult or data
variable. It is not a HyperTalk action verb. Note: If "put" is used preceding
the function, use the following form:

   put msmail(...) into <container>

If "into <container>" is left off, the result or data will be put into the
message box and the message box will appear.
