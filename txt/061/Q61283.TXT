SUMMARY
=======

If you change your Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks chime to a custom
chime, although the SND ID and the Purgeable check box are correctly set, the
chime may not sound when new mail arrives.

The problem may be caused by Suitcase II, version 1.2.5. If the Suitcase II INIT
loads before the Microsoft Mail driver, the custom chime will not sound when
mail arrives. To correct this problem, change the order in which the INITs load
so that the Microsoft Mail driver loads before Suitcase II. This problem does
not occur with the standard mail arrival chime, just the custom chime.
