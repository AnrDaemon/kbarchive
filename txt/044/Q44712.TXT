TITLE   :Mac Wkst: Identifying Which Users Are Logged On Local Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For Appletalk Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To verify which users are currently signed in to Microsoft Mail, you must use
the Address Mail window. To check which users are signed in, click the Address
icon in any of the Send windows, then click the Local icon. Those users
currently signed in have the word "connected" enclosed in parentheses next to
their names. In versions of Mail earlier than version 2.0, users who were signed
in had small Macintosh computer icons next to their names.

This feature applies only to users with accounts on the server you are signed on
to, and only when the Local icon has been selected. Mail cannot check whether
users on other servers are signed in and cannot check for signed-in users on
your server if the All icon is selected.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to the above method, a Network Manager can check any logged-in users
if the Microsoft Mail Server is running as an application. Running the Mail
server in this fashion will display an "AppleShare 2.0" type of window that
displays users who are currently logged in to the server. However, the upkeep of
this window is considered low priority for the server and, therefore, the
information shown in the window may be slightly out of date.
