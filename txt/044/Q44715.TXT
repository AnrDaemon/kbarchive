SUMMARY
=======

A Microsoft Mail server running on a Macintosh Plus may not see itself in the
Chooser unless the AppleTalk file has been copied into the System Folder on the
hard disk of the Macintosh Plus. This file is provided on the Microsoft Mail
Server Installer disk.

If you installed a Mail server on a Macintosh Plus without using the Installer,
be sure to copy the AppleTalk file that came with that disk into the System
Folder. If you use the Installer, the AppleTalk file is automatically copied
into the System Folder of a Macintosh Plus server.

Macintosh Plus servers do not show up in their own Chooser because a Macintosh
Plus cannot treat itself as an AppleTalk node on an AppleTalk network. The ROM
(read-only memory) on a Macintosh Plus does not support self-addressing.
