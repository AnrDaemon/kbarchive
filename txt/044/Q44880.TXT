A Windows "temporary" file is created under these circumstances:

 - Windows Desktop (Write, etc.) and MDI (multiple document interface)
   applications (such as Excel) create temporary files to handle necessary user
   editing.

   Because a Desktop application cannot have multiple documents open at once, it
   must immediately create a temporary file that allows you to "undo" any
   editing, etc. MDI applications create temporary files only when needed (for
   related editing), rather than for every worksheet that is open.

 - When running an MS-DOS standard application under Windows/286, Windows/286
   creates a temporary file (for example, ~PIFCHFA.TMP) so it can swap to disk
   to make room for other applications to use memory.

 - When printing from Windows or any Windows application with the spooler
   enabled, Windows creates temporary files on the hard disk. Windows spools the
   print job to the temporary file and then sends it to the appropriate printer
   as a background operation.

Microsoft recommends that there be approximately 2 MB of free disk
space available for the creation of temporary files.
