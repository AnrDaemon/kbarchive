SUMMARY
=======

In an NMAKE makefile, you can specify a path in an inference rule. The syntax of
an inference rule without a path is as follows:

   .<from extension>.<to extension >:

This syntax is somewhat limited because both the "from file" and "to file" are
evaluated as if each exists in the current directory. In NMAKE, you can add a
path specifier to an inference rule by using the following syntax:

   {frompath}.<from extension>{topath}.<to extension>:

Note: If you specify a path for one element of an inference rule, you must
specify a path for both rules. For example, to compare a C source code file in
the current directory with its corresponding object file in the C:\OBJECTS
directory, use an inference rule like the following:

   {}.c{c:\objects}.obj:
   cl /c $<;

MORE INFORMATION
================

When NMAKE encounters a target and dependency line that is not followed by any
commands, NMAKE searches the makefile for an inference rule to use. During the
process of searching for a match, NMAKE uses the directories of the target and
the dependent. In other words, the following target and dependency line does not
use the inference rule defined above because the object file path does not match
the path specified in the inference rule:

   test.obj : test.c

This line would invoke the predefined .c.obj: inference rule. To invoke the above
inference rule, modify the line to the following:

   c:\objects\test.obj : test.c
