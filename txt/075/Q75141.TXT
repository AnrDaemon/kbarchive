TITLE   :Using SMARTDRV.SYS and RAMDRIVE.SYS with QEMM's QEXT.SYS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

According to Quarterdeck, MS-DOS version 5.0's RAMDRIVE.SYS and SMARTDRV.SYS may
fail to load if they are placed after the line that loads QEMM 50/60's or QRAM's
driver QEXT.SYS in the CONFIG.SYS file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, modify the CONFIG.SYS file so that both lines that
load RAMDRIVE.SYS and SMARTDRV.SYS appear before the line that loads QEXT.SYS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An updated version of QEXT.SYS is available that corrects this problem. It is
available on the Quarterdeck bulletin board service (BBS) or from Quarterdeck
Technical Support. Contact Quarterdeck for more information.
