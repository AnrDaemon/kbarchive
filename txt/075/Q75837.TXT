SUMMARY
=======

After installing the Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade, the BACKUP command can return
the message "Incorrect DOS version" if you try to format a disk during the
backup procedure using the /f[:size] parameter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

BACKUP can appear to work correctly for the first few disks, but when the BACKUP
command tries to back up the OLD_DOS.X directory it attempts to use the older
version of FORMAT.COM.

To correct the problem, remove or rename all old FORMAT.COM files from your
computer OR delete the OLD_DOS.X directory using DELOLDOS.EXE.

To find all occurrences of FORMAT.COM, type the following from the root
directory:

   " DIR/S FORMAT.COM " (without the quotation marks)

More information on the BACKUP command can be found in the "Microsoft MS-DOS
User's Guide" on pages 370-373.
