SUMMARY
=======

After you set up some third-party icon files from an icon library and change the
icons in Windows, the icon (.ICO) files are deleted from the hard drive. Even if
you exit and restart Windows, the third-party icons still appear in the groups
where they were placed for specific applications.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The icon (.ICO) file is merely a visual representation of the icon itself. The
actual association for the icon is retained within the specific group (.GRP)
file where the icon resides. Any time an icon is changed, that change is written
to the group file. As long as the icon is not replaced with another icon, the
association remains and Windows continues to use that icon representation.
