SUMMARY
=======

According to Matthew Bender's technical support, several customers have reported
the following error when using Matthew Bender's Search Master software with
MS-DOS version 5.0:

   CDR 103 Error: Not of High Sierra Format or ISO 9960 Format

The error is caused by using outdated versions of the Microsoft CD-ROM
extensions. Matthew Bender recommends using version 2.2, the most current
version of the CD-ROM extensions, to eliminate the error.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Based on licensing agreements with OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), the
Microsoft CD-ROM extensions are not available directly from Microsoft. Instead,
they are distributed to OEMs and bundled with their CD-ROM drive packages.
Customers must contact their drive manufacturers to obtain the current
MSCDEX.EXE.


Version 2.03 is the most commonly found release, and version 2.10 is expected
within the next couple months. Search Master provides the ability to search an
entire compact disk for specific words. It is usually invoked via the file
MBSEARCH.BAT, which in turn executes MB.EXE. Before Search Master can work
correctly, both the CD-ROM driver and the extensions should be current and
working correctly.
