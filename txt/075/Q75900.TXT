======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A second hard disk cannot be accessed in enhanced mode when you use SMARTDRV.SYS
version 3.03. Symptoms of this problem include

   sector not found

and

   Violated System Integrity

errors when you attempt to use non-Windows-based applications.

WORKAROUND
==========

You may need to add the /b- switch to SMARTDRV.SYS to access a second hard drive
consistently.

To load SMARTDRV.SYS correctly, rewrite the device line in the CONFIG.SYS file as
follows:

   DEVICE=C:\DOS\SMARTDRV.SYS 1792 256 /b-

MORE INFORMATION
================

The /b- switch turns off the double buffering feature. It is used primarily for
SCSI hard drives, although it is sometimes necessary when a system includes a
SCSI CD-ROM drive. This switch may also be needed even if the CD- ROM drive does
not contain a disk.
