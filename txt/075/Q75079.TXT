TITLE   :FIX: NMAKE 1.13 May Return U1002: Invalid Macro Invocation '$'
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER::1.13
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft NMAKE Utility for MS-DOS, version 1.13, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: MS-DOS 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

NMAKE version 1.13 generates the following error when an "extra" dollar sign ($)
is used in an environment variable:

   fatal error U1002: syntax error : invalid macro invocation '$'

CAUSE
=====

Unlike previous versions, NMAKE version 1.13 evaluates all environment variables
as inherited macros at initialization time. Because the $ character indicates
that a macro follows, NMAKE attempts to evaluate the character following the
final dollar sign in the context of a macro. For example, using a command such
as "Prompt $p$g$" to set the system prompt, and then using NMAKE 1.13, causes
this error.

RESOLUTION
==========

The online help for the U1002 error indicates that it occurs when a single
dollar sign ($) appears without a macro name associated with it. This error can
be eliminated by avoiding extraneous dollar signs in environment variables.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in NMAKE version 1.13 for MS-DOS
and OS/2. This problem was corrected in NMAKE version 1.2 for MS-DOS and OS/2.
