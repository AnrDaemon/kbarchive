TITLE   :Using SHIFT+PRINT SCREEN with Setup Video Problems

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

On certain machines, Setup can conflict with the video hardware and display a
partial, scrambled, or condensed screen.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, attempt to print the screen by pressing the
SHIFT+PRINT SCREEN keys. If the printout shows a readable screen, the Setup
program can be completed by printing each screen as it appears and following the
instructions on the printouts.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On certain machines, it may be necessary to use a key combination other than
SHIFT+PRINT SCREEN. Possible combinations include CONTROL+PRINT SCREEN or PRINT
SCREEN by itself. CAUTION: Other key combinations can toggle printer echoing of
the screen output.

This workaround may not work on some machines because of different PRINT SCREEN
interrupt handlers or corrupted video memory.
