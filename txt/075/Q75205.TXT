-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1e, 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2, 3.2a, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: MS-DOS 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you use Micro and Monitor with Microsoft Mail for PC Networks while you are
running an MS-DOS application in graphics mode, screen garbage will appear upon
mail notification.

For example, if you load Micro and Monitor prior to running an MS-DOS application
such as Word Perfect or Microsoft Word for MS-DOS in graphics mode, the MS-DOS
application graphics screen will become corrupted when mail is received;
however, the mail notification dialog box will appear correctly.

CAUSE
=====

Micro and Monitor are terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs used with
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks that notify the user of incoming mail. Running
any MS-DOS application in graphics mode causes conflicts with Micro and Monitor,
which are text mode TSR applications.

RESOLUTION
==========

After you press the ENTER key to close the notification dialog box, you can do a
screen redraw to regain the correct screen appearance of the MS-DOS application
in graphics mode.
