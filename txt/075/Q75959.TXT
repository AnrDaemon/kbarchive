The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit (SDK) for HyperCard, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0b, 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The HyperCard Software Developers Kit's external function (XFCN) resource for
Microsoft Mail version 2.0 does not work with Mail version 3.0. All HyperCard
stacks created with version 2.0 of the Mail Interface Document stack must be
updated with the 3.0 version of this document stack, which is included on the
Extras Disk that ships with Mail 3.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To update an existing stack:

1. Open the Mail Interface Document stack in the Extras Disk.

2. Select Installing from the list of topics.

3. Click the Install Interface button.

4. Select the stack to be updated and click the Open button.

5. A warning message will appear: "Some resources which you are attempting to
   add already exist in the destination file. Would you like to replace them?"
   Click OK. This installs the new XFCN resource over the old one.

NOTE: The version 3.0 HyperCard Software Developers Kit's XFCN resource has many
new and expanded features. Three functions were updated in a way that might not
be completely compatible with the old version. Check scripts for GetEnclosure,
GetField, and RemoveField commands. The Mail Interface Document stack has more
information on how these functions changed.
