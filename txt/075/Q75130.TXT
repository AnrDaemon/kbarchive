SYMPTOMS
========

If you run MS-DOS Shell on a system using a CGA monitor, some colors may blink.

RESOLUTION
==========

Possible solutions to this situation are to re-expand the video files, remove
the "bright" color selections if they are unsupported, and to refresh the screen
within Shell. These options are described below:

 - Expand the CGA files for MS-DOS Shell to the MS-DOS directory. In some cases,
   Setup detects a different graphics card and expands the wrong graphics
   support with MS-DOS Shell. Check to see what kind of monitor is present, then
   expand the appropriate files. The proper files for each type of monitor are
   listed in the MS-DOS 5.0 "Microsoft MS-DOS Getting Started" manual.

 - Some CGA cards don't support the bright colors. Any color scheme listed in
   the DOSSHELL.INI file that has a bright prefix blinks if bright colors are
   not supported by the CGA card. To prevent these colors from blinking, use a
   color scheme that does not include bright colors, or edit the color schemes
   in the DOSSHELL.INI file to remove the bright prefix on the colors.

 - If you have a screen saver loaded and task swapping is enabled, when you swap
   applications, the colors may blink. Press SHIFT+F5 to refresh the screen and
   eliminate the blinking.
