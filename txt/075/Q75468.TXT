SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a Windows application capable of printing or when you try to print
from some Windows applications, the following error message is displayed:

   ATM fonts and Postscript fonts don't match on Fontname

CAUSE
=====

This error message means that there is a mismatch in the ATM.INI and/or the
WIN.INI files. The two most common mismatches are:

 - More font entries are in the ATM.INI than in the PostScript printer section
   of the WIN.INI file.

 - More line entries for fonts are in the Postscript printer fonts section of
   the WIN.INI file than on the softfonts=## line in the same section.

RESOLUTION
==========

Edit your WIN.INI fileso that the mismatches are corrected.
