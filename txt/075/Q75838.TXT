SUMMARY
=======

Setup may change the settings for the Logitech mouse settings back to the
default value every time Setup is run to change any other option.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To demonstrate this, assume you have a computer with a mouse port. The mouse is
connected to COM1 and is a serial mouse. Assume the settings were

      [LOGIMOUSE]
      Type=2
      Port=1

which means a serial mouse was on COM1.

Then, the settings were changed to

      [LOGIMOUSE]
      Type=1
      Port=

This change prevents the mouse from working.

To make the mouse work correctly, change the SYSTEM.INI settings to the correct
settings for the mouse.
