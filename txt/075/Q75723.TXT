TITLE   :AT&T 6300 Needs Driver for Date/Time Stamping
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:msdos

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After you install Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0 on an AT&T 6300, the machine will not
display the correct date or time at startup. This problem occurs on the AT&T
6300 and AT&T 6300 WGS (Work Group System) machines, which are
8088/8086-microprocessor based.

Another problem that has been reported with the AT&T 6300 clock is that it
will not read or display a 1992 date. This problem occurs because the calendar
chip was designed to function only up to and including 1991. At the time the
chip was developed, it was assumed customers would upgrade their computers
before the 1992 calendar year.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have AT&T MS-DOS version 4.0 or 4.01, you will find ATTCLOCK.SYS on
the original diagnostic disk. The file is not found on earlier releases of
AT&T MS-DOS or releases from other OEMs. Once you locate the file, copy it
to the root directory of the hard drive, and add the following line to your
CONFIG.SYS file:

      device=c:\attclock.sys

After rebooting the machine, the time and date can be correctly set, and the
machine will maintain correct time and date. The one exception to this solution
is if you have an AT&T 6300 Plus and are using AT&T MS-DOS 3.3.

The device driver ATTCLOCK.SYS is available on CompuServe in the IBMHW forum, or
from the AT&T bulletin board at (908) 769-6397.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
or reliability.
