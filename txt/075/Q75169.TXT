The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

IBM is shipping their own version of the Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade called
PC-DOS 5.0 Upgrade. It is currently available from software retailers. This is
quite different from the Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade released by Microsoft.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some of the major differences are as follows:

1. Setup: IBM's Setup works basically the same, with some exceptions to the
   options available. You cannot install to floppy disks, and you must have IBM
   PC-DOS installed on the hard drive. Only IBM PC-DOS versions 2.1 to 5.0 are
   supported. You also must boot from the Upgrade to install.

2. IBM PC-DOS 5.0 Upgrade has 122-key keyboard support.

3. IBM PC-DOS 5.0 Upgrade has Icelandic code page support.

4. IBM PC-DOS 5.0 Upgrade ships with Microsoft Mouse Driver version 7.04.

5. IBM PC-DOS 5.0 Upgrade includes a utility to convert version 4.0 DOS Shell
   .MEU files into the current DOSSHELL.INI file.

6. IBM PC-DOS 5.0 Upgrade does not include DEBUG.EXE and EXE2BIN.EXE. These
   programs must be purchased separately as part of the IBM Technical Reference.

7. Date and Time of IBM PC-DOS files are 05-09-91 at 12:00p.

8. The "IBM PC-DOS Getting Started" manual recommends using SMARTDRV.SYS as
   opposed to IBMCACHE.

9. IBM PC-DOS 5.0 Upgrade includes AUTOCONF.EXE, which will make your original
   CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files compatible with DOS 5.0.

The product included here (IBM PC-DOS) is manufactured by vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
