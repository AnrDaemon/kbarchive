======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Colorado Memory Systems (CMS) tape software must be version 2.46 (or later)
to be compatible with MS-DOS version 5.0 or later. While earlier versions may
appear to work, they may err intermittently and compromise data integrity.

MORE INFORMATION
================

CMS produces tape drive subsystems that either use an adapter card or the floppy
controller to control the tape drive (neither of which are seen as logical
devices by DOS). The tape software (TAPE.EXE) versions prior to 2.46 are not
compatible with MS-DOS 5.0 or later. While earlier versions may appear to run
correctly, intermittent errors and/or data corruptions will occur.

Owners of CMS drives should contact CMS to get the new version (2.46) of the tape
software. As of 8/14/91, CMS is shipping the new version at no charge to owners
of CMS tape drives. Owners of the CMS tape drives must provide the serial number
of the tape drive to receive the new software.

The products included here are manufactured CMS, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
