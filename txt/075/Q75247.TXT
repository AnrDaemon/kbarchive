-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 5.10, 5.10a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The LOCAL directive used inside a procedure requires a language specifier on the
.MODEL directive in the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) versions 5.1 and 5.1a,
and in the Microsoft QuickAssembler versions 2.01 and 2.51. If a language is not
specified on the PROC line, the warning

   A4001: Extra characters on line

will be generated by MASM 5.1 and 5.1a. The error

   A2135: feature requires language specifier on .MODEL

will be generated by QuickAssembler 2.01 and 2.51.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To correct the code, specify a language on the .MODEL statement. To correct the
following program, replace the statement ".MODEL small" with ".MODEL small,
language" where language is either FORTRAN, PASCAL, Basic, or C.

MASM 6.0 does not require a language specifier on the .MODEL statement to use the
LOCAL directive.

Sample Code
-----------

   ; Assemble options needed: none

         .MODEL small
         .CODE
         PUBLIC proc1
