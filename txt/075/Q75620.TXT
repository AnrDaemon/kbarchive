The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade contains MS-DOS-aware drivers for MS-NET,
Microsoft LAN Manager 1.0 and 2.0, Novell NetWare, and other current versions of
several networks. The LAN Manager files include the minimum you should use on an
MS-DOS 5.0 machine running LAN Manager. Additional files that could not be
included because of disk space limitations are available.

As mentioned in the MS-DOS 5.0 README.TXT file, the LAN Manager Supplemental
Disks can be ordered from the Microsoft Sales Information Center at (800)
426-9400. (Note: This number is different from the one in README.TXT; that
number is out of date.)

MORE INFORMATION
================

The LAN Manager Supplemental Disks are available on two 5.25-inch disks or one
3.5-inch disk. The files are a superset of the files shipped with the MS-DOS 5
Upgrade package. For example, several utilities are now able to load LAN Manager
2.0 services (such as Netpopup, Encrypt, and Messenger) into UMBs on a
service-by-service basis. The README.TXT file shipped with the disks explains
how to correctly configure your system.

Additional query words: 5.00 5.00a lanman net redirector msredir
