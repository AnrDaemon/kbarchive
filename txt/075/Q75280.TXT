TITLE   :FIX: ALIGN or EVEN Cannot follow DUP in Same Module
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an ALIGN or EVEN directive is used in a module after data has been defined
with the DUP operator in the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.0, the
alignment value will be adjusted by one for each DUP that precedes it. The
example code below illustrates this.

RESOLUTION
==========

Currently, the only workarounds in this case are to either avoid using ALIGN (or
EVEN) and manually pad the segment by the required amount or to not use the DUP
operator in the same segment that will use the ALIGN (or EVEN) directive.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 6.0. This problem
was corrected in MASM version 6.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample code can be used to demonstrate the problem.

Sample Code
-----------

   ; Assemble options needed: /Fl /Sa

   example segment para    public 'data'
           db      2 dup (0)
           db      3 dup (0)
           align 8
           dw      0             ; starts at offset 6 instead of 8
   example ends
   END
