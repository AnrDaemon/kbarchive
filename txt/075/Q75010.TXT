======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Windows Help Compiler version 3.0 does not support all of the formatting
options that word processors, such as Microsoft Word for Windows or Microsoft
Word for the Macintosh, are capable of creating. This document briefly lists
many of these unsupported formats.

The complete specification of the Rich-Text Format (RTF) is included in the
Microsoft Word for Windows Technical Reference (Microsoft Press).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Most of the time, unsupported format information is ignored by the Help Compiler
without any warning messages.

The following items are not supported by Windows Help 3.0 in any form:

   Absolute-positioned objects
   Annotations
   Bookmarks
   Document formatting properties
   Document information
   Headers and footers
   Index entries
   Style sheets
   Table of contents entries
   Tables

NOTE: In Windows Help version 3.1, Word for Windows tables are supported.

The following items are used for specified purposes in the Help Compiler:

Footnotes
---------

Note that the footnotes are "overloaded" and used for build tags, context
strings, browse sequences, keywords, alternate keywords, and topic titles by the
Help Compiler.

The group containing footnote text begins with the control word "\footnote".
Footnotes are anchored to the character that immediately precedes the footnote
group. If automatic footnoting is defined, the group can be preceded by a
footnote reference character, identified by the control word "\chftn". The
following is an example of a group containing footnotes:

NOTE: The "\chftn" control word is ignored in version 3.1 of the Help compiler.

Character Formatting Properties
-------------------------------

The last group of RTF control words controls character formatting properties. A
control word preceding plain text turns on the specified attribute. Some control
words (indicated by an asterisk following the description) can be turned off by
the control word followed by 0 (zero).

   Control Word   Meaning
   ------------   -------

   \plain         Resets application's default character formatting
                  properties

   \b             Bold*

   \i             Italic*

   \strike        Strikethrough. Overloaded. Used to indicate a jump term
                  (hot spot).

   \scaps         Small capitals*

   \v             Hidden text. Overloaded. Used to indicate the context
                  string of the jump destination.

   \f#            Font number. (Replace # with the appropriate number.)

   \fs#           Font size in half-points (default is 24) (Replace #
                  with the appropriate number).

   \ul            Continuous underline*

   \uldb          Double underline Overloaded. Used to indicate a jump
                  term (hot spot).

In order to read negative \expnd values created by Word for the Macintosh,
Windows Help uses only the low-order 6 bits of the value read. Word for the
Macintosh does not emit negative values for \expnd. Instead, it treats values
from 57 to 63 as -7 to -1, respectively (the low-order 6 bits of 57 to 63 are
the same as -7 to -1).

Special Characters
------------------

Special RTF characters are listed below. If a character is not recognized by the
RTF reader, it is ignored and the text following it is considered plain text.
The RTF specification is flexible enough to allow new characters to be added for
interchange with other software.

   Control Word   Meaning
   ------------   -------

   \'hh           A hexadecimal value, based on the specified character
                  set (may be used to identify 8-bit values).

An ASCII 9 will be accepted as a tab character. The code \<ASCII10> (line
feed) or \<ASCII13> (carriage return) is treated as the control word \par.
The backslashes must be included or RTF will ignore the control word. It is also
desirable to insert a carriage-return/line- feed pair (without backslashes) at
least every 255 characters for better text transmission over communication
lines.
