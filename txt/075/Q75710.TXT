-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.01, 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

According to Novell technical support, the error message

   SYS2090 - system failed to load program

comes from the Novell Btrieve utility. This is not a DOS error message, but it
results from the use of Novell's BUTIL.EXE without having BTRIEVE.EXE properly
loaded.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Btrieve for DOS is a record management system designed for high performance data
handling and improved programming productivity. The Btrieve utility is a self
contained executable program that applications access via function calls.
BTRIEVE.EXE remains in memory as a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program for
BUTIL.EXE to access as needed.

The BUTIL.EXE utility, used with Btrieve, allows you to re-create and manage the
data files created with Btrieve. The error message "SYS2090 - system failed to
load program" is a result of BTRIEVE.EXE not being loaded prior to BUTIL.EXE.
BTRIEVE.EXE can be loaded in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file as follows:

   lh [drive:][path]btrieve

   -or-

   loadhigh [drive:][path]btrieve

If BTRIEVE.EXE is loaded low, it is recommended to use the /E switch to force
Btrieve buffers low. For example:

   [drive:][path]btrieve /e

However, when BTRIEVE.EXE is loaded high, the /E switch is not necessary.
