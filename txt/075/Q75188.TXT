======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Some Emerson computer systems are equipped with ROM DOS (the operating system is
contained in the computer's read-only memory). Installing the MS- DOS 5 or later
upgrade on these systems could cause the system to stop responding (hang) after
it is rebooted.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem disable the system's ROM DOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Emerson systems with model numbers ending in V have an added sound feature that
uses voice simulation to speak out DOS errors. This feature is written into the
ROM DOS. If the ROM DOS is disabled and MS-DOS 5.0 or later is installed, the
sound feature does not work.

The Emerson systems that use ROM DOS are as follows:

XT Class Machines
-----------------

800ec

AT Class Machines
-----------------

500ec V
516ec
4412ec
80386ec V
2000sc
3000sc

To work around this problem, you can disable the boot from ROM DOS and have the
computer boot from disk. There is a different procedure for XT and or AT class
machines. To disable the ROM DOS boot, do the following:

1. If you have a XT class machine, press CTRL+ALT+ESC during startup.
   If you have a AT class machine, press CTRL+ALT+S during startup.
   This will bring you to the CMOS menu.

2. Choose SETUP from the menu and press ENTER.

3. On the right side of the screen there is an entry for the boot device.
   Highlight ROM and press F5 for next value or F6 for previous value (there are
   only two values so you can press either one to toggle to Disk).

4. Press F10 to save the configuration.

5. Reboot the system by pressing ESC three times.
