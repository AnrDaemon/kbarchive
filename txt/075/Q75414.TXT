SUMMARY
=======

SPECIAL=DEFAULT in the DOSSHELL.INI file specifies which program item or group
item within MS-DOS Shell Program Manager will be selected (highlighted) at
startup. Note that there should be only one such line within DOSSHELL.INI.

The group or program item that was last specified within Shell when Shell was
exited will be tagged within DOSSHELL.INI with the SPECIAL=DEFAULT line.
Therefore, after exiting Shell completely, the last program or group item is
still tagged.

To find more information on the DOSSHELL.INI file, query on the following words:

   " MS-DOS and DOSSHELL " (without the quotation marks)

Additional query words: 5.00 6.00
