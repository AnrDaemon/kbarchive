The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Xerox Ventura Publisher versions 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 may behave erratically under
MS-DOS Shell versions 5.0 and 5.0a. To avoid this behavior, you should run
Ventura Publisher from the command prompt with MS-DOS 5.0/5.0a loaded into
conventional memory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Ventura Publisher must be run from the command prompt rather than MS-DOS
5.0/5.0a Shell because it requires more memory than is available when the Shell
is running. Ventura Publisher version 3.0 Professional Extension requires 560
kilobytes (K) of free conventional memory to run. Version 3.0 base software
requires 580K of free conventional memory to run. Consult the Ventura Publisher
documentation for exact memory requirements for other versions.

MS-DOS 5.0/5.0a must be loaded into conventional memory because Ventura Publisher
accesses 60K of the high memory area (HMA). Loading MS-DOS 5.0/5.0a into the HMA
with Ventura Publisher running causes erratic behavior; for example, your
machine may stop responding (hang) or you may have problems printing.
