The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

When a print job is terminated, the amount of available memory reported in the
Program Manager's About box declines. This indicates that allocated memory
objects remain on the global heap.

CAUSE
=====

One possible cause is an application that calls the print job abort procedure
directly through its instance thunk. If, after this call, the print job is
aborted and the application exits its printing loop without calling the ABORTDOC
printer escape, the print job will not be properly aborted and allocated memory
will be left on the heap.

RESOLUTION
==========

The abort procedure returns FALSE if the print job has been aborted. If the
abort procedure returns FALSE, the application should call the ABORTDOC printer
escape in Windows 3.0 or AbortDoc() in Windows 3.1. The following code fragment
demonstrates this procedure:

      // Call the Abort procedure
      if (!(*lpfnAbortProc)(hDC, 0))
          Escape(hDC, ABORTDOC, NULL, NULL, NULL);

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An application registers its printing abort procedure with Windows by calling
the SETABORTPROC escape in Windows 3.0 or SetAbortProc() in Windows 3.1. Windows
automatically calls the abort procedure during the NEWFRAME or NEXTBAND escape.
If the print job is aborted during the NEWFRAME or EXTBAND escape, Windows
automatically calls the ABORTDOC escape/AbortDoc().

If the print job is aborted when the application has called the abort procedure
directly, the application must call the ABORTDOC escape/ AbortDoc().
