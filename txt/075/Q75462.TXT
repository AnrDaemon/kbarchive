SUMMARY
=======

Syquest removable hard drives require Always Technologies' driver controller
BIOS revision 3.33. With BIOS revisions earlier than 3.33, full compatibility
with Syquest's removable media is not guaranteed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to BIOS revision 3.33, the Syquest utilities package version 2.1 or
later is required if the Syquest drive will be used as a secondary hard drive.
Without one of these versions, the Syquest drive will only function as the
primary or boot drive.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
