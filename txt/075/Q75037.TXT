SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft MS-DOS version 5.0 RESTORE command allows you to view files that
have been backed up with the MS-DOS version 5.0 BACKUP command.

NOTE: If the command reports that no files are found, add the /s parameter to
include subdirectories.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a directory listing command is issued on a backup floppy disk, the only
information reported is as follows:

    Volume in drive X is BACKUP XXX
   Volume Serial Number is XXXX-XXXX
   Directory of X:\ 

   Backup 001     <filesize> <date> <time>
   Control 001    <filesize> <date> <time>
           2 file(s)  <total> bytes
                      <total> bytes free

To view the individual files on a backup floppy disk, use the following command
and syntax:

   " restore a: c: /d " (without the quotation marks)

NOTE: This is the correct syntax for the command. On page 144 of the "Microsoft
MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference" for version 5.0, the command syntax is
incorrectly stated as: "restore c: a: /d."

The RESTORE command displays only the files found on the backup disk's root
directory. If no files are found in the root directory of the backup disk, the
message "ERROR! No files were found to restore" is displayed.

To view all the files on a backup disk, you should add the /s parameter to the
restore command to view files (for example, RESTORE A: C: /D /S). This also
lists all the files in the root and subdirectories on the backup disk.

For more information, see page 144 of the version 5.0 "Microsoft MS-DOS User's
Guide and Reference."
