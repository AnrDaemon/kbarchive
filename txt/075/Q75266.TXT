SUMMARY
=======

To create a "reverse video" effect in Word, one of two methods can be used. The
first is to create a graphic item in the Picture window, and the second is to
use text and paragraph formats.

There are benefits and limitations to both methods. If you create a graphic item,
you can create any shape background with any color fill, but you cannot edit the
text, fill the background, or change the shape without returning to the Picture
window. If you create the effect with text and paragraph formats, you can easily
format the text and paragraph attributes, but you are limited to only square
fills in shades of gray.
