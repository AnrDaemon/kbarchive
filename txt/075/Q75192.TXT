The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The setup/diagnostic shell built into ROM on Zenith computers normally allows
you to select several different drives as the boot drive. Under MS-DOS 5.0, the
only options that will work are the first hard disk (C) and the first floppy
drive (A).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The setup/diagnostic shell is invoked on some Zenith computers by pressing the
CTRL+ALT+INSERT key combination. This shell will accept a number of commands,
one of them being the command that switches the boot drive. The normal syntax of
this command is as follows:

   B [{F|W}][{0|1|2|3}][:<partition>]

where

   F = Floppy
   W = Winchester (hard drive)
   0 = the first drive
   1 = the second drive, and so on

For example, BW0 means boot from the first hard disk (C), and BF1 means boot from
the second floppy (B). By design, MS-DOS 5.0 can only boot from the first hard
drive (C) and the first floppy drive (A). Consequently, the only valid options
under MS-DOS 5 are BW0 and BF0.
