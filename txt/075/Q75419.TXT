SUMMARY
=======

You can create a bootable MS-DOS version 5.0 floppy disk without running the
Setup program.

If there are problems running Setup, this method can be used to continue a manual
installation of the Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade. For more information on manual
installation, query on the following words:

   " manual and install and MS-DOS and 5.00 and upgrade " (without the quotation
   marks)

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create a bootable MS-DOS 5.0 floppy disk from the Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade
disks, do the following:

1. Use the DISKCOPY command from the current version of MS-DOS to copy all of
   the files from the first Upgrade disk to the new floppy disk.

   There must be a direct match between the new floppy disk, the Upgrade disks
   that were received, and the bootable floppy drive on the machine. For
   example, if the Upgrade disks are low-density 5.25-inch disks, then a
   low-density 5.25-inch disk must be used for the boot up disk and the bootable
   floppy drive must be 5.25-inch. (This procedure copies the boot sector onto
   the new floppy disk.)

2. Delete all of the files on the new disk with the following command:

      del a:*.*

3. Create a temporary directory on the hard drive. For example, BOOT.

      C:
      cd\ 
      md boot

4. Copy the file EXPAND.EXE to the temporary directory just created using the
   following command:

      copy a:expand.exe c:\boot

   Note: EXPAND.EXE is on disk 6 (5.25-inch disks) or disk 3 (3.5-inch disks).

5. Copy the three files listed here from the Setup disk included with the MS-DOS
   5 Upgrade into the temporary directory created in step 3:

      copy a:io.sy_ c:\boot
      copy a:msdos.sy_ c:\boot
      copy a:command.co_ c:\boot

   Note: These files must be copied in the order listed.

6. From the temporary directory, expand each of the three files onto the new
   floppy disk:

      expand c:\boot\io.sy_ a:io.sys
      expand c:\boot\msdos.sy_ a:msdos.sys
      expand c:\boot\command.co_ a:command.com

This new floppy disk is now bootable with MS-DOS 5.0.
