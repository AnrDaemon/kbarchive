SUMMARY
=======

In the Microsoft Windows graphical environment, the graphics device interface
(GDI) should never pass a NULL lpDrawMode to a display driver. However, when a
printer driver uses the brute interface to call the BitBlt routine in the
display driver, the calling printer driver provides the parameters, including
lpDrawMode, to the display driver. In this case, GDI cannot prevent the driver
from sending incorrect parameters.

For this reason, a display driver must be robust and must not crash when it
receives incorrect arguments.

The source code for the 8514/A display driver, included with the Microsoft
Windows Device Development Kit (DDK), provides a good example of how to handle
operations with a NULL lpDrawMode parameter.
