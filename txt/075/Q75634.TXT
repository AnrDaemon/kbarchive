The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22

SUMMARY
=======

Using a percent sign (%) in a batch file requires that two percent signs (%%) be
specified.

For example, the command to display "5%" from a batch file would be :

   ECHO 5%%

MORE INFORMATION
================

MS-DOS uses %1, %2, ... %9 as replaceable command line parameters. For example,
before executing the command ECHO %1, %1 will be replaced with the first
parameter passed to the batch file. %0 is replaced with the command used to
execute the batch file.

A single percent sign on a line is treated as a "nul" character in a batch file.
For example:

   ECHO %     is processed as ECHO
   ECHO a%b   is processed as ECHO ab

If a command contains two percent signs, MS-DOS will treat any characters between
them as an environment variable to be expanded. For example, if the SET command
shows that the current environment variables are

   COMSPEC=C:\COMMAND.COM
   PATH=C:\DOS
   PROMPT=$P$G
   B=C

then

   ECHO %PATH%     is processed as ECHO C:\DOS
   ECHO a%b%       is processed as ECHO aC
   ECHO a%b b%a    is processed as ECHO aa

If there are no characters between the two percent signs, one percent sign is
stripped off and the other will remain. This is why a FOR command that echos the
name of each file with a .COM extension would be

   FOR %V IN (*.COM) DO ECHO %V

but if the same command is placed in a batch file, the following is required:

   FOR %%V IN (*.COM) DO ECHO %%V
