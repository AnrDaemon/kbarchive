-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Mouse drivers versions 8.0 and later allow for the use of an XMS
driver to load themselves high. The /U switch allows you to load the mouse
driver high, but does not work if MS-DOS is loaded into conventional memory.
MS-DOS loads into conventional memory with the line DOS=LOW in the CONFIG.SYS
file, or the lack of a DOS= line in the CONFIG.SYS file.

To work around this feature, type the following command:

   " setver mouse.com 4.00 " (without the quotation marks)

Make sure that SETVER.EXE is being loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file, and then
restart the machine. To verify that the mouse driver is loading into XMS, type
"MEM /C" (without the quotation marks). The size of the driver in conventional
memory should be approximately 3.5K.

NOTE: Microsoft does not recommend using the /U switch when DOS=HIGH with
Microsoft Mouse Driver, version 8.0. For more information, query on the
following words:

   " conflicts and mouse.com and DOS=HIGH " (without the quotation marks)


MORE INFORMATION
================

MOUSE.COM uses an XMS Sub-Allocate call to load itself high. This call requires
MS-DOS to be loaded into the HMA before the mouse can load high.

MOUSE.COM has a version check built into it that allows it to load into the HMA
in MS-DOS versions earlier than 5.0. If the MS-DOS version is earlier than 5.0,
MOUSE.COM does not check to see if MS-DOS has been loaded high first. Loading
SETVER.EXE allows MOUSE.COM to make the appropriate XMS initialization calls to
allow for proper HMA loading.
