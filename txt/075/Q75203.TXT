The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1e, 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If any of the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks terminate-and-stay resident (TSR)
programs (Micro, Monitor, or Operator) are loaded on a NetWare local- area
network (LAN), they may not unload when they are requested from a batch file.
This problem occurs regardless of whether the TSR is loaded into memory from the
command line or from a batch file; the common factor is that the TSR is
requested to unload from a batch file.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be traced to NetWare's method of allocating environment space,
and only occurs on NetWare LANs. This is NOT a problem with MS-Net
Redirector-based networks.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is no permanent solution at this time; however, you can eliminate the
problem by allocating more environment space. To increase environment space
usage, use the Set command with dummy variables such as these:

   set a=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
   set b=bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb

If the TSR is loaded when these variables have been issued, it will unload when
requested from a batch file. The number of extra environment variables will
depend on how simple your configuration is.
