SUMMARY
=======

To modify the prompt when using the Command Prompt program item in MS-DOS
version 5.0 or later Shell, do the following:

1. Highlight the Command Prompt program item and choose Properties from the File
   menu. Modify the Commands option to the following

   <name>.BAT

   where <name> is any filename you want to specify. The default is
   COMMAND. <name>.BAT should replace COMMAND.

2. Create the batch file <name>.BAT. It should include the following:

      echo off
      set pr=%prompt%           ; Saves the current prompt
      prompt <message>%prompt%  ; Makes a new prompt
      command                   ; Spawns a new COMMAND.COM file
      prompt %pr%               ; Resets the prompt

   <message> can be any characters or escape sequences you want to include
   in the prompt. The prompt cannot be more than 127 characters in length.

3. Type "EXIT" (without the quotation marks) to reset the prompt and return to
   Shell.

The above procedure will not modify the prompt when you use the SHIFT+F9=Command
Prompt option. This method will return you to the current COMMAND.COM, leaving
Shell resident.
