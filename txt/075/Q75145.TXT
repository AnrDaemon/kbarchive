SUMMARY
=======

A serial Microsoft Mouse will not function correctly if a Microsoft bus mouse
card is installed in the machine.

The Microsoft Mouse driver will detect the presence of the bus card before it
detects the mouse connected to the serial port. The Microsoft Mouse driver will
then try to use the card. The only solution is to remove the bus card from your
machine.
