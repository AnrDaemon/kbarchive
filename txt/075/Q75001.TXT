SUMMARY
=======

Parent.exe is a sample application that demonstrates how to dynamically change
the parent of a child window by using the SetParent function.

NOTE: This technique is very risky when applied to pop-up windows. Pop-up windows
do not have a parent, instead they have an owner, which is a different
relationship. Trying to change the parent of a pop-up window can cause the
application or Windows to crash.
