Before installing Microsoft MS-DOS version 5.0 or later on a Tandy 2500XL or
1000TL3, you must follow the procedure outlined below to disable the ROM DOS
functionality of the machine.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To disable the ROM DOS functionality of the machine, do the following:

1. Insert the floppy disk labeled MS-DOS/GW-BASIC into drive A.

2. At the A prompt, type "SETUPXL" (without the quotation marks) if your
   computer is a Tandy 2500XL or "SETUPTL3" if your computer is a Tandy 1000TL3.
   If you're using a Tandy 1000TL, type "SETUPTL" (without the quotation marks).

3. The BIOS/ROM DOS Setup program loads and displays a menu of options. Use the
   ARROW keys to change from option to option. Press the SPACEBAR to change the
   settings. The current settings are the only ones displayed.

4. Use the DOWN ARROW key to select the BOOT SOURCE option. The choices are ROM
   and DISK, with ROM being the default.

   NOTE: On a Tandy 1000TL, select the PRIMARY STARTUP option. On a Tandy
   1000TL3, select the STARTUP DEVICE option. (The choices are the same.)

5. Press the SPACEBAR once to change the setting to DISK.

6. Press the RIGHT ARROW key to select AUTO-DESKMATE. The choices are ENABLE and
   DISABLE, with ENABLE being the default.

7. Press the SPACEBAR once to change the setting to DISABLE.

8. Press F2 to restart the computer and update the EEPROM.

You can now proceed with the MS-DOS 5.0 or 6.0 installation.
