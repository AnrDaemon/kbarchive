SUMMARY
=======

When using EMM386.EXE on a workstation that is connected to the network by an
IBM Token Ring card, the card may have trouble initializing if the areas that it
uses are not excluded in the EMM386.EXE line in the CONFIG.SYS file. One of the
following exclude statements should be tried:

1. EMM386.EXE X=CC00-CFFF X=D800-DBFF (or X=CC00-DBFF)

2. EMM386.EXE X=D400-D7FF X=DC00-DFFF (or X=D400-DFFF)

MORE INFORMATION
================

The IBM Token Ring card uses two separate address areas in the upper memory area
(UMA); one is used to address ROM and the other is used to address RAM. There
are two possible configurations of these address spaces under the default set
up:

Primary
-------

   ROM CC00 (16K)
   RAM D800 (16K)

Alternate
---------

   ROM DC00 (16K)
   RAM D400 (16K)

The ROM address area can be set with the network reference disk or through
switches on the card. The RAM address area can be set with the LAN support
program as outlined in the README file that comes with the LAN support program.

The product included here is manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
