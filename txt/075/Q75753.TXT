SUMMARY
=======

Winconnect is a file transfer Windows application from Traveling Software, Inc.
and hDC that allows you to connect a laptop (or any type of MS-DOS computer) to
a desktop computer. One computer (usually the laptop) is designated as the
server and the other (desktop) is the client. The client runs Windows and can
access all drives on the server. The server runs a memory resident program from
MS-DOS and sends and receives files as requested by the client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before Installing Winconnect
----------------------------

No other applications ("microapps") manufactured by hDC should be running when
attempting to install Winconnect. Such applications must be unloaded for
Winconnect to modify the HDCLIB.DLL file. This file contains information used by
all hDC microapps.

Executing Winconnect Server Program in a Window
-----------------------------------------------

The server program (WCS.EXE) should not be run from Windows. It should be run
from DOS.

Piping(|) and Redirection(>)
----------------------------

Piping and redirections are incompatible with the Winconnect TSR (WC.EXE).

Port Problems upon Quitting Windows
-----------------------------------

If ports are changed and settings are saved during a Winconnect session, after
quitting Windows, the computer may not recognize the port previously selected.
To solve problem, reboot the computer.

Disabling Winconnect
--------------------

1. Remove WC.EXE from AUTOEXEC.BAT.

2. Remove MICROMAN.EXE from the LOAD= line in WIN.INI.

3. Reboot the system.

4. Start Windows 3.0.

(WC.EXE is the memory resident program used to set up the computer as the client
and establish contact with the server.)
