MORE INFORMATION
================

DTK included corrections to many revisions for compatibility with IDE hard
disks. To determine the BIOS version, start your machine and check the first two
digits of the line starting with the number sign (#). For example, #34062890S
contains 34 after the # sign, which refers to revision number 34.

For more information about upgrading your BIOS, contact DTK technical support.
