The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The documentation for the WM_RENDERFORMAT message on page 6-98 of the "Microsoft
Windows Software Development Kit Reference Volume 1" for version 3.0, and on
page 188 of the "Microsoft Windows Programmer's Reference Volume 3: Messages,
Structures, and Macros" manual for version 3.1 is incomplete.

The following information should be added to the documentation for the function
as a Comments section:

   During the processing of this message, the <B>OpenClipboard</B> and
   <B>CloseClipboard</B> functions should NOT be called. The                WM_RENDERFORMAT message is sent from within the <B>GetClipboardData</B>    function which an application calls from within a block of code            surrounded by the <B>OpenClipboard</B> and <B>CloseClipboard</B>          functions. While processing the WM_RENDERFORMAT message, the application    should not again call the <B>OpenClipboard</B> and <B>CloseClipboard</B>    functions.

NOTE: The first sentence of the preceding information is already included on page
188 of the "Microsoft Windows Programmer's Reference Volume 3: Messages,
Structures, and Macros" manual for version 3.1.

Note that while processing the WM_RENDERALLFORMATS message, the OpenClipboard and
CloseClipboard functions must be called in order to call the SetClipboardData
function. For more information, query on the following words:

   prod(winsdk) and WM_RENDERALLFORMATS and OpenClipboard

Additional query words: 3.00 3.10
