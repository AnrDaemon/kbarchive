SUMMARY
=======

If you use DrWatson to assist you in troubleshooting a Microsoft Windows version
3.0 Unrecoverable Application Error (UAE), you may encounter the "Recoverable
Application Error" (REA) instead. The RAE is DrWatson's interpretation of the
Unrecoverable Application Error (UAE) and should be treated like a UAE.

NOTE: DrWatson is included in Windows versions 3.1 and 3.11 and Windows for
Workgroups version 3.1. It is not included with Windows 3.0 or Windows for
Workgroups 3.11.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A sample RAE is as follows:

   

     "RECOVERABLE APPLICATION ERROR"

        "PP" ( PowerPoint, for example) "has failed in HPPCL5A.DRV"

                "IGNORING FAULT IS RISKY"

                "Cancel"        "Ignore"

If you choose Cancel, you usually are returned to the current program,. If you
choose Ignore, you usually receive the same error or a UAE. However, the second
line of the error, which mentions which program failed in a particular area,
gives some clue as to what caused the error, and should be considered in
troubleshooting.

For example, if DrWatson mentions the program failed in a certain driver, delete
that driver and reinstall the driver. You may have to copy the EXPAND.EXE
program over to your hard drive and expand the driver to your hard drive from
the original Windows disks.

For more information on how to use the EXPAND.EXE program, query on

   expanding and files and from and original and disks and windows
