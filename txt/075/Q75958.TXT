TITLE   :Mac Hyp: Adding Multiple Enclosures to a Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For Appletalk Networks
PROD/VER::3.0,3.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit (SDK) for HyperCard, versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The AddEnclosure command in the Microsoft Mail version 3.0 HyperCard Software
Development Kit (SDK) does not use Mail's File dialog box. It uses the standard
Macintosh File dialog box, which adds only one file to the message at a time.

To add multiple enclosures, this command must be called multiple times.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following script allows an unknown number of files to be added to a
message:

     on mouseup
         put msmail (CreateMessage) into messageRef
         put 0 into count
         repeat
           put msmail (AddEnclosure, messageRef)
           if msmail (GetEnclosureInfo, messageRef, "enclCount") = count
      then exit repeat
           add 1 to count
         end repeat

This script brings up the standard Macintosh File dialog box until the Cancel
button is clicked.
