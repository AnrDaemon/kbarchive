TITLE   :PRB: Windows SDK Tools Group Icons Incorrect
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Program Manager, when the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) Tools
group is opened, generic, blank Windows icons are displayed for the individual
tools.

CAUSE
=====

Windows was run after installing the Windows (SDK) without rebooting the
computer to reset the PATH environment variable to include the Windows SDK
subdirectory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, copy the SDKTOOLS.GRP file from the Development Tools
disk into the Windows directory on the hard disk. Shutdown and restart the
computer, and then start Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Since the Windows SDK Setup program does not run under Windows, it cannot use
DDE (dynamic data exchange) to create a program group in the Program Manager. To
create a program group, the Windows SDK comes with a existing group file which
does not contain the path or icon information for the individual tools.

The Setup program modifies the PROGMAN.INI file to use this group file. If
Windows is run without restarting the computer after installing the Windows SDK,
then the Windows SDK subdirectory will not be listed in the PATH environment
variable. When this occurs, the Program Manager cannot find any of the tools on
the hard disk. Consequently, the Program Manager assigns each of the tools the
blank (generic) icon.

When Windows is closed, the Program Manager saves the icon information into the
group file, which causes the generic icons to then be shown.
