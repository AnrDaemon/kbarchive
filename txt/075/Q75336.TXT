SUMMARY
=======

ScrolDlg.exe contains a sample application that displays a scrolling dialog box.
The procedure to define a scrolling dialog box is quite straightforward. It is
done by specifying the WS_VSCROLL and WS_HSCROLL window styles. The dialog
procedure must set the scroll range and process horizontal and vertical
scrolling messages. Windows will process the WM_PAINT message on behalf of the
dialog box.
