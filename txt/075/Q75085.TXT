 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a you are using an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) version of DOS that
does not correspond to your computer manufacturer (for example, you are using
IBM PC-DOS on a Zenith), the Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade and MS-DOS 6 Upgrade
Setup programs may not work correctly. If this is the case, Setup displays the
following error message:

   UNRECOVERABLE ERROR
   ERROR READING FILE SETUP.INI

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the error message, do the following:

1. Use the VER command to verify that the correct OEM DOS version is being used
   (that is, the DOS that came with the machine).

2. If an incorrect OEM DOS version is being used, install the OEM DOS that came
   with the machine.

3. Run the MS-DOS Upgrade Setup program again.
