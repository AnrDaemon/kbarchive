SUMMARY
=======

F-15 Strike Eagle II by Microprose needs LOADFIX to run. To run the program,
issue the following command:

   LOADFIX F15.COM

MORE INFORMATION
================

This game has an installation program that creates a batch file to execute the
game. If the installation program is used, the batch file must be modified to
include LOADFIX before the executable file, as shown above.

F-15 Strike Eagle II is copy protected. The files can be installed on a hard
disk, but whenever the game is started, the game requires the program disk to be
in the drive. This disk acts as a "key" disk.
