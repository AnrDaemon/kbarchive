SUMMARY
=======

You may encounter problems using PCSupport 2.1 (a token ring router) with the
MS-DOS version 5.0 MEM command when shelling out of enhanced mode Windows 3.0.
When typing the MEM /C command, the machine will display the requested
information, then hang. Performing MEM /C from standard or real mode Windows
will not cause a system hang.

This problem occurs because of a conflict between Windows enhanced mode memory
allocation and the token ring card being used. The MEM command will function
normally from enhanced mode Windows if EMM386.EXE is loaded in the CONFIG.SYS
file and the token ring card's address is excluded using the X= parameter.
EMM386.EXE should be loaded before the token ring drivers.

Note that this problem will occur even if EMM386.EXE is NOT loaded.
