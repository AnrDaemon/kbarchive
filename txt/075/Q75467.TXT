SUMMARY
=======

The Power Nine video driver manufactured by Number Nine Computer Corporation may
have difficulty installing if the driver disk is a different format size than
the Windows 3.0 disk.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, if the Windows 3.0 installation is started on a 3.5-inch disk, and
the video driver is on a 5.25-inch disk, the Windows installation will begin
prompting for 5.25-inch disks after the video driver has been installed. In this
instance, it will stop while copying the VGASYS.FON file. Pressing the F1 (Help)
key will generate the message:

   Setup needs to copy a file to your system that does not exist on the disk
   that is currently in the disk drive. You can either insert the disk Setup
   needs, or you can type the pathname where the file can be found. The name of
   the file that Setup is trying to copy will appear in the lower-right corner
   of your screen when you exit this Help

The Power Nine product included here is manufactured by Number Nine Computer
Corporation, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or
otherwise, regarding this product's performance or reliability.
