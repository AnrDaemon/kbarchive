SUMMARY
=======

If Microsoft Windows is started from a menuing system such as Point and Shoot
version 3.0, you may receive multiple Unrecoverable Application Errors (UAEs) or
general protection (GP) faults within Windows.

Menu systems such as Point and Shoot are executable files that create a batch
file and then remove themselves from memory. This creates a shell around the
Windows environment that may cause problems within Windows.

Microsoft does not recommend or support starting Windows from any type of shell
program. Microsoft recommends and supports starting Windows at the command
prompt or from within the AUTOEXEC.BAT file only.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Varteck International Inc. reports that it has upgraded its Point and Shoot menu
system to version 3.09, which is the latest to date (as of 9/91).
