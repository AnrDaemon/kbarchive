SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.4 of the PostScript printer driver, distributed with version 3.0 of
the Microsoft Windows graphical envionment, implements the following paper size
constants:

      #define DMPAPER_LETTER_EXTRA   50
      #define DMPAPER_LEGAL_EXTRA    51
      #define DMPAPER_TABLOID_EXTRA  52
      #define DMPAPER_A4_EXTRA       53

These constants are specific to the PostScript driver (as is the entire range
from 50 to 56). These constants are used only by Linotronic printers to help
save paper and do not generally apply.

The DRIVINIT.H header file distributed with version 3.0 of the Microsoft Windows
Device Development Kit (DDK) lists these constants while the DRIVINIT.H file
distributed with version 3.0 of the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
(SDK) does not. In version 3.1, the PRINT.H header file replaces DRIVINIT.H.
PRINT.H contains the following note:

   WARNING: The PostScript driver mistakingly uses DMPAPER_ values between 50
   and 56. Don't use this range when defining new paper sizes.

To avoid conflicts, do not use the range 50-56 when defining new paper sizes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DRIVINIT.H file contains constants (defined with the prefix DMPAPER_) for
all the standard paper sizes. These constants are usually retrieved from the
printer driver by using the ExtDeviceMode function, and examining the
dmPaperSize field. Some PostScript drivers support the paper sizes listed above,
and will return one of the listed constants if the extra paper size is selected
in the ExtDeviceMode dialog box.
