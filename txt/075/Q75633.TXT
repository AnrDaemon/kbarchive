SUMMARY
=======

If you specify the /T switch, Mirror creates a system file called PCTRACKR.DEL
that is updated every time a file is deleted. When Mirror is resident in memory
and you delete the file PCTRACKR.DEL, Mirror records the deletion by recreating
the file PCTRACKR.DEL.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To delete PCTRACKR.DEL, do the following:

1. Change the file attributes with the following command:

   " attrib -s -h -r pctrackr.del " (without the quotation marks)

   When the above command is executed, the hidden, system, and read only file
   attributes are removed.

2. To terminate Mirror and remove it from memory, type the following at the DOS
   prompt:

   " mirror /u " (without the quotation marks)

   After you have executed the above command, you can use the DELETE command to
   delete the PCTRACKR.DEL file.
