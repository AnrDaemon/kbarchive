-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After installing the Novell network redirector, attempting to print to a local
parallel printer immediately returns the error:

   Not ready writing to LPT1

This error can be caused if the Novell SHELL.CFG file contains a line setting the
number of local printers to zero. Changing this line to indicate the correct
number of local printers may remedy this problem. For example, if you have one
parallel printer connected to LPT1, confirm that the SHELL.CFG file contains

   LOCAL PRINTERS=1

or delete the LOCAL PRINTERS= line from the SHELL.CFG file altogether.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Novell recommends adding LOCAL PRINTERS=0 into the SHELL.CFG file only if the
workstation does not have a printer connected to its parallel port. By adding
this line, you can prevent a workstation from hanging if the SHIFT and PRINT
SCREEN keys are pressed while the workstation is not spooling.

For more information on Novell Netware and the SHELL.CFG file, please contact
your authorized Novell reseller.
