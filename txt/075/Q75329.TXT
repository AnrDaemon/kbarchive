======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If Paintbrush is printing extra blank pages for a single-page image, then the
width and height may be set too large. Check these settings by choosing Image
Attributes from the Options menu. Most laser printers knock off a .25- inch
border around the page. Thus, the printer only prints up to 8 x 10.5 inches on
an 8.5 x 11-inch sheet of paper.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the image attributes are set too large under Paintbrush, the print job is
broken down into separate sheets. The default settings for the drawing area
within Paintbrush are 6.67 inches wide and 5.0 inches high. If the size is set
to within 1 inch of the page size the printer sees, then the image is printed to
more than one page.

Normally, the maximum drawing area can be extended to a width of 7.49 inches and
a height of 6.0 inches if printing a single image to an 8.5 x 11 inch sheet of
paper. Adjusting the width or height up a mere .01 inch (to 7.5 inches wide or
6.01 inches high) causes Paintbrush to print extra pages.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Set up the printer for 8.5 x 11-inch paper.

2. Run Paintbrush.

3. From the Options menu, choose Image Attributes.

4. Set the width to 8.0.

5. Set the height to 10.5

6. Choose OK.

7. From the File menu, choose New.

8. Draw a line from one end of the screen to the other, scrolling in order to
   cover the complete width of the page.

9. Print the image.
