SUMMARY
=======

Declaring an Edit control with certain styles, and altering the text, may have
undesirable effects. Depending upon whether or not pointers to the text are
passed to other functions, changing the text in place may generate an
Unrecoverable Application Error (UAE).

Declaring an Edit control with any of the following styles, ES_LOWERCASE,
ES_UPPERCASE, or ES_OEMCONVERT, and calling either SetWindowText (hEdt,lpstr) or
SetDlgItemText (hDlg, editID, lpstr) alters the string in place. Calling either
one of the previously mentioned functions to alter a string contained in a code
segment, which is labeled PURE in the corresponding .DEF file, will result in a
UAE.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.10 controls strings
