SUMMARY
=======

When an application receives the WM_RCRESULT message, the rectBoundInk field of
the RCRESULT structure reports the bounds on the input ink in client
coordinates, not in tablet coordinates.

When the Microsoft Recognizer receives the RCRESULT structure returned from the
RecognizeInternal function, the Recognizer builds the rectBoundInk rectangle, as
well as performing other tasks. The rectBoundInk rectangle is built if the
following four conditions are met:

 - The RCO_COLDRECOG flag is not set

 - The ink width is greater than 0 (zero)

 - hpendata is valid (the GetPenDataInfo function returns success)

 - The bounding rectangle in the PENDATAHEADER structure is not empty

If any one of these four conditions is not met, the rectBoundInk field will be
set to zero.

Also note that the rectBoundInk variable may contain area outside the area
specified in the rectBound variable in the RC structure. In other words, while
the ink drawn is constrained by rc.rectBound, rcresult.rectBoundInk is based on
the data collected from the pen.
