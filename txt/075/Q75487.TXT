SUMMARY
=======

To use the Logitech Cordless Mouse within Windows, set up the Windows
configuration to use the "Microsoft or IBM PS/2" mouse driver.

For MS-DOS applications, use version 5.01 of the Logitech mouse driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Logitech Cordless Mouse comes either as a serial or PS/2 style mouse and
adapters are normally included with it. The Windows Logitech serial mouse driver
does not work with this mouse. There may be a pointer on the screen, but it does
not respond to movement of the mouse. Another symptom is that there may not be a
light on the receiver. Normally, this light appears each time the mouse is
moved.

According to Logitech technical support, the Logitech Mouse installation
procedure sets up the Windows "Logitech Plus" driver. This driver should work
with all Logitech mice, including the cordless mouse.

NOTE: If the Logitech Mouse install program is run correctly, the Logitech Plus
option is the only Logitech Mouse option available.

For more information, contact Logitech technical support.

The Logitech Cordless Mouse is manufactured by Logitech, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
