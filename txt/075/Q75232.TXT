The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

If your application reports that there is not enough space on the network drive
to save the files you are accessing via Novell NetWare, verify that there is
enough space available on the network drive. If there is, try setting the
following line in the SHELL.CFG file and restart the network:

   CACHEBUFFERS=NO

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SHELL.CFG file is a NetWare configuration file used to define configuration
options for the NetWare shell components IPX, NET5, and Net BIOS. It should be
located in the start-up directory of the network shell programs. Many network
installations do not have a SHELL.CFG present as a default; in this case, you
can create one using any nonformatting text editor.

For information on cachebuffers option and other SHELL.CFG options, see the
"NetWare Supervisor Reference Guide."
