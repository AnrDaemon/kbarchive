SYMPTOMS
========

CHKDSK returns an invalid value for total disk space if the Coherent Setup
utility is used to "shrink" a logical DOS partition.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Coherent is a UNIX operating system clone. During the installation of Coherent,
the Setup program can shrink the logical DOS partition and create a non-DOS
partition for the Coherent operating system. After this has been done, CHKDSK
will return the size of the extended DOS partition as the sum of the extended
DOS partition and the non-DOS (Coherent) partition.

FDISK will return the correct partition sizes when "Display Partition
Information" is selected.

The problem occurs because Coherent's Setup program only modifies the master boot
record (MBR) entries and not the other linked partition tables or the modified
logical drive boot sectors.
