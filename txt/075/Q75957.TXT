The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0b, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Form Designer for Microsoft Mail can create custom forms for use on a Mail
server. Included in the form is a description of the printed form. This
description assumes some defaults that can be changed only with special scripts.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following global font variables can be modified on the print screen:

   laserLabelFont
   laserFieldFont
   imageLabelFont
   imageFieldFont

NOTE: This information relies on System 6.0.x font ID numbers and may not work
correctly with System 7.0. Make the form and install it using System 6.0.x only.
Once it is installed, it doesn't matter if System 6.0.x or 7.0 users uses it,
just as long as it was created and installed with System 6.0.x.

To specify fonts for the print description, you must access the card script. The
only scripts that are used in a form when it is compiled are "on compile"
scripts. Put new values in the global font variables listed above to override
the defaults. To modify the scripts, do the following:

1. Go to the printed form card.

2. Bring up the message box (press COMMAND+M).

3. Type the following, then press RETURN:

   " set userLevel to 5 " (without the quotation marks)

4. Open the card script (press COMMAND+OPTION+C).

5. Add a script that looks like this:

      on compile                         <- Handler for the compile message
         global laserFieldFont           <- Declare the global
         put 5513 into laserFieldFont    <- Put in new value (see below)
      end compile                        <- End of the compile message

The font ID numbers (5513 in example), as found in the FONT resource of the
System file, will vary from Macintosh to Macintosh. The font ID numbers from the
System of the Macintosh the form is compiled and installed from are changed to
font names during installation.
