The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

According to Quarterdeck, the MS-DOS version 5.0 DISPLAY.SYS and PRINTER.SYS
utilities cannot be successfully loaded into upper memory with the LOADHI.SYS
that is included with QEMM-386 5.13 and earlier, QEMM - 50/60 5.00 and earlier,
and QRAM 1.01 and earlier.


MORE INFORMATION
================

You can load these drivers into low memory or you can use the MS-DOS 5.0
DEVICEHIGH command, provided you have a 386 or better processor with at least 1
MB of RAM. The following configuration in CONFIG.SYS file assumes you have the
physical requirements to load devices high, and the MS-DOS 5.0 files are in the
C:\DOS directory.

   DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS
   DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE noems
   DOS=HIGH,UMB
   DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\DISPLAY.SYS
   DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\PRINTER.SYS

REFERENCES
==========

For more information on loading devices and terminate-and-stay- resident
programs (TSRs) high, please see Chapter 12, "Optimizing Your System," in the
version 5.0 "Microsoft MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference."
