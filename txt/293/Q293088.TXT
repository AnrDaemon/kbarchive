   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) to determine
the organization and site name.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

In some cases, if MSExchangeDS fails to start in a single-organization,
single-site, and single-server environment, you may need to rebuild the Exchange
Server computer, and then restore Dir.edb. To restore Dir.edb, you must use the
same organization, site, and server names. To determine these names:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate and click the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA\Parameters

3. Double click X500 DN : REG_SZ:, and then make a note of the string value. The
   value looks similar to the following text:

   /o=<Organization_name>/ou=<Site_name>/cn=Configuration/cn=Servers/cn=<Server_name>/cn=Microsoft
   MTA

4. Quit Registry Editor.


Additional query words: find org site name xgen
