SUMMARY
=======

Searching a Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) directory with XML
requires the following:

 - The directory in which the content is located must be on a drive formatted
   for NTFS. If you put the directory on a drive formatted for the file
   allocation table (FAT) file system, clients can search for resource content,
   but they cannot search for resource properties.

 - Indexing Service must be running.

 - In the Internet Information Services (IIS) snap-in, the Virtual Directory
   properties for your WebDAV directory must have the Index this resource and
   Read access options selected.

By using the Microsoft implementation of WebDAV, you can create a tool for
clients to search a directory for content, properties, or both. The following
example (of a raw request) demonstrates a basic search command from which you
can create a tool:

   SEARCH / HTTP/1.1
   Host: iis
   Content-Type: text/xml
   Content-Length: 157

   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <g:searchrequest xmlns:g="DAV:">
   <g:sql>
   Select "DAV:displayname" FROM SCOPE()
   </g:sql>
   </g:searchrequest>

For details on how to create a search tool, see the Microsoft Platform SDK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The example in this article is a very basic sample. Using the WebDAV search verb
in conjunction with Indexing Service is unsupported and may return unexpected
results.

If you want to take advantage of all of the indexing and searching capabilities
of the Windows 2000 Indexing Service, Microsoft recommends that you access the
Indexing Service and its APIs with Microsoft Active Server Pages (ASP).

If you have questions about how to search Exchange DAV folders with XML, contact
Microsoft Exchange Server Support.
