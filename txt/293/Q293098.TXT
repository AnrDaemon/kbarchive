TITLE   :XWEB: HTTP 404 "Page Cannot Be Found" Accessing OWA Behind Proxy
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::2.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Proxy Server version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error when you are trying to access the Outlook
Web Access (OWA) logon page from a location that is external to your Proxy
server:

   HTTP 404 Page Cannot Be Found

You are also unable to log on to OWA from inside your network to bypass the Proxy
server.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because OWA and Proxy Server are running on separate
computers, and you did not configure Web Publishing to send requests to another
Web server in Proxy Server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, enable Web Publishing to send requests to another Web
server:

1. Start Internet Service Manager (ISM), which starts the Microsoft Management
   Console (MMC) Internet Information Server (IIS) snap-in .

2. On the Action menu, click Web Proxy, and then click Properties.

3. On the Publishing tab, click to select the Enable Web Publishing check box.

4. Click "Sent to another web server".

5. Type the internal IP address or the NetBIOS name of the OWA server. You can
   also use the fully qualified domain name as long as the name can be resolved.

Note: If more than one Web server exists, refer to the articles that are listed
in the "More Information" section in this article.
