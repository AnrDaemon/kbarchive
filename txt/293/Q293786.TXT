Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, nor does it occur on computers that are running the
English version of Windows 95.

STATUS

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. On a test computer that is running Windows 95 OSR2 Spanish with Visual Basic
   6.0 Spanish installed, install the SQL Server 7.0 Client (Spanish) and
   Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) 2.1 Service Pack 1 (SP1).

2. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic 6.0. Form1 is created by
   default.

3. From the Project menu, click References, and then click "Microsoft DAO 3.0
   Object Library".

4. Add a CommandButton (Command1) to Form1.

5. Paste the following code in the declarations section of Form1:

   Option Explicit

   Dim spcodbc As Workspace
   Dim mibd As Database
   Dim strSQL As String
   Dim rsCount As Recordset
   Dim rs As Recordset

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
   Set spcodbc = Workspaces(0)
   Set mibd = spcodbc.OpenDatabase("D:\VB5\NWind.mdb")
   strSQL = "Select * From Categories"

   Set rsCount = mibd.OpenRecordset(strSQL, dbOpenSnapshot)
   Text1.Text = rsCount.RecordCount

   Set rs = rsCount.OpenRecordset(dbOpenSnapshot)

   End Sub

6. Run the program, and click the CommandButton on Form1. Notice that a General
   Protection Fault occurs when you click the CommandButton.
