PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool kbui kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms120 kbsms120bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade from Systems Management Server (SMS) version 1.2 to SMS
version 2.0, all new hardware inventory files may go to the BADMIFS folder. When
you view Resource Explorer, it may not display any inventory for the client
computers. The DataLoader log file (Dataldr.log) may contain the following
entry:

   Processing file 7LXAWNST.MIF
   Processing machine MACHINE
   File successfully parsed. Processing item (GUID =
   GUID:D9343DC0-254F-11D3-84BA-00105AA9F6DE)
   CGroup::DefineAttributes - will widen SYSTEM column SMSID from 8 to 48
   CSqlTable::CreateIndex - these columns are already indexed
   CDefinedGroup::WidenDefinedAttribute - could not change data type.
   CGroup::DefineAttributes - unable to widen attributes
   CGroup::DefineGroupAndAttributes - couldn't define attributes for SYSTEM
   CMachineSource::InsertMachine - could not validate machine
   Cannot process MIF X7LXAWNST.MIF, moving it to
   C:\SMS\inboxes\dataldr.box\BADMIFS\W2A8VMG9.MIF

CAUSE
=====

The Inventory Dataloader is unable to widen a column in a table and create an
index on that column because another index already exists for that column.
Removing this index causes this action to succeed.

WORKAROUND
==========

Contact Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS) for assistance with removing
the index from the SMS database.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
