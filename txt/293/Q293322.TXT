TITLE   :Directory Service Client Not Installed on Windows NT 4.0 SP6a
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0 SP6,4.0 SP6a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP6a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 SP6a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP6, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Installing the directory service client (Dsclient.exe) on Windows NT 4.0 with
Service Pack 6a (SP6a) with certain hotfixes installed may not succeed, and you
may receive the following Setup error message:

   Setup cannot detect the Windows NT4 with SP6a or higher operating system
   which is required to install the Directory Service Client. The installation
   will terminate.

CAUSE
=====

Dsclient.exe uses the GetVersionEx function to obtain information about the
version of the operating system and service pack. GetVersionEx may return an
incorrect service pack number on computers that have Windows NT kernel versions
with RC designations. For example, if SP6a and the Q246467 hotfix is installed,
GetVersionEx returns the ServicePackMajor value as 1 instead of 6. The Windows
NT kernel (Ntoskrnl.exe) that is included with the Q246467 hotfix sets the
version to Service Pack 6, RC 1.3.
