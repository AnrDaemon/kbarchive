TITLE   :Error Message: Failed to Generate the Certificate Request
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOSWin2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Web Server Certificate Wizard to create a Certificate Request,
the following error message may occur:

   Failed to Generate the Certificate Request.

   The string contains an invalid X500 name attribute key, oid, value or
   delimiter.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when you add invalid characters (such as a comma, hyphen, and
so on) to the Certificate Request in the Organization or Organizational Unit
fields. The most common cause of this problem is the use of a comma (,).

RESOLUTION
==========

A successful Certificate Request can only contain the characters A through Z
and/or 0 through 9 in the fields of the request. You can use a period (.) in the
common name of the key request to specify a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).

If you must use a comma (,) and/or period (.) in the Organization Name, then you
need to enclose the Organization Name in quotes for X500 to allow the generation
of the request. For example:

   "Microsoft, Inc."
