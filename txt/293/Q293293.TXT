TITLE   :PRB: Cannot Update SCC Status From ProjectHook.Init()
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbProjManager kbvfp600 kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbCodeSnippet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Article idea submitted by: Ted Roche


When you try to update files that are under Source Code Control (that is, Visual
SourceSafe) from the ProjectHook's Init event, the Source Code Control methods
that are associated with the File objects fail.

CAUSE
=====

The Visual FoxPro (VFP) documentation states, "Note that the project object and
its properties and methods are not available in the ProjectHook object Init
event." Because the project object logs on to the Source Code Control database,
any attempt to operate on the files at this time fails.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use a different method to operate on the files, For example, set a flag so that
the first operation on any file causes the latest version of all the files to be
brought down to the working folder.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Project Hook class in the class designer.

2. Add the following code to the Init event:

   This.oProject = _VFP.ActiveProject
   WAIT WINDOW NOWAIT "Project Hook Enabled"
   This.GetLatestAll()

3. Create a class method called GetLatestAll, and add the following code to it:

   LOCAL oFile, m.i

   FOR m.i = 1 TO This.oProject.Files.Count
      oFile = This.oProject.Files[m.i]
      ? oFile.Name
      ? oFile.SCCStatus
      IF NOT oFile.SCCStatus = 0    && SCCFILE_NOTCONTROLLED
         ? oFile.GetLatestVersion()
      ENDif
   ENDfor  && each file

4. Add the following code to the class's Destroy event:

   This.oProject = NULL

5. Save the class, and add it to a project that is under Source Control.

6. Open the project, and note that although each file and its SCCStatus are
   listed, each call to GetLatestVersion fails.
