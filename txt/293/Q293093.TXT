======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you shut down the computer, the browser service may cause the computer to
stop responding; the occurrence of this problem is very rare.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because there are not enough worker threads available.


RESOLUTION
==========

 

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this problem, increase the number of threads in the delayed work
queue:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the <--value name --> value under the following key in the
   registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session
   Manager\Executive\AdditionalDelayedWorkerThreads

3. On the Edit menu, click DWORD, type "6" (without the quotation marks), and
   then click OK.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

By setting this value to 6, you are providing a total of nine threads, which
allows for the delayed work items to run and signal the timer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0.
