The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 Setup may fail to upgrade an existing
installation of Windows for Workgroups even if the minimum disk space
requirement of 500 kilobytes (K) is present. Setup operates normally until it
reaches the file WIN386.EXE. You then see a dialog box telling you there is not
enough disk space to perform a complete upgrade.

You will only notice this problem if you have between 500K and 545K of free disk
space on the drive of your current Windows for Workgroups installation.

CAUSE
=====

Usually, Windows for Workgroups Setup checks to make sure that at least 500K of
disk space is available. Usually there is slightly more than this amount
available, resulting in no problems when you perform an upgrade over Windows for
Workgroups.

Setup uses the Windows dynamic link library (DLL) VER.DLL, which copies files and
verifies Windows component versions. To function correctly, VER.DLL requires as
much disk space as the file it is copying. When it reaches WIN386.EXE, it cannot
find enough space and stops the installation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups Setup
version 3.1. This problem does not occur in later versions of Windows for
Workgroups.
