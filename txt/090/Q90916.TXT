SUMMARY
=======

Packard Bell ships its OEM version of the Microsoft Windows 3.1 without any
driver disks. The drivers are installed on the hard disk drive in a directory
called WINDRVS. If the directory or any of its files are accidentally deleted,
you can obtain replacement disks from Packard Bell.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Packard Bell ships its OEM version of Windows 3.1 on four disks. This version
has a plain VGA setup and no installed printer drivers. The WINDRVS directory is
referenced in the SETUP.INF and is displayed as the default in the dialog box
that asks for the path to Windows drivers.

For more information or replacement disks, call Packard Bell customer service.
