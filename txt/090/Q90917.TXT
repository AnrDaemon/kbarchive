-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you finish formatting a disk in the background of the Error Selecting
Drive dialog box, File Manager does not appear in the Task List. Also, File
Manager does not appear if you press ALT+TAB.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you change drives or refresh the drive window, File Manager searches the
current drive to display its contents. If File Manager detects an unformatted or
unrecognizable disk, it displays the Error Selecting Drive dialog box and
prompts you to format the disk.

If you choose the Yes button in response to this prompt, the File Manager Format
Disk dialog box is displayed and you can format the disk. If you format the disk
with File Manager in the background, when the format is completed, you cannot
switch back to File Manager from the Task List, and File Manager does not appear
if you press ALT+TAB to switch to an application.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following techniques:

 - Minimize all application windows except File Manager. This makes File Manager
   the active window by default.

 - If visible, click the File Manager window.

 - If the File Manager is not visible, press ALT+ESC to display its window at
   the front of the desktop and click the window.

 - Run File Manager from the Program Manager (double-click the File Manager
   icon).

Note: You can run only one instance of File Manager at a time.
