The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After you install Microsoft Windows for Workgroups, you may need to reinstall
the Microsoft C7 compiler.

The C7 compiler replaces some of Microsoft Windows files with different versions.
The Windows for Workgroups Setup program, in turn, updates these files, which
may cause the application to fail.

================

Possible Workaround
-------------------

Before you attempt a total reinstall, follow these steps (this procedure may
allow you to use C7 without reinstalling the program):

1. Add the following lines to the [386enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file:

         DEVICE=<drive:>\C700\BIN\VPFD.386
         DEVICE=<drive:>\C700\BIN\CVW1.386
         DEVICE=<drive:>\C700\BIN\VMB.386

   where <drive:> specifies the drive where you have C7 installed.

2. Verify that the [386enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file contains the
   following line:

         DEVICE=*VMCPD

   If not, add this line as well.

3. Save your changes, then reboot your system.

If this procedure doesn't allow you to use C7, then you need to reinstall the
application.
