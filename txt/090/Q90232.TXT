======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The list of current share names, passwords, and comments is stored in a cache or
buffer. If you share a large number of resources, the size of the share list
exceeds the buffer size, dumping the list entirely. This results in shared
folder icons (with hands) reverting to standard folder icons (no hands) in both
the main File Manager directory listing and Connect dialog box. Also, the share
confirmation dialog box no longer appears when you remove or rename a shared
resource.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups File
Manager version 3.1 and version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.11 disappears unavailable no
