 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows for Workgroups over Microsoft LAN Manager version 2.0,
the network services do not start because Setup did not add a NET START command
to AUTOEXEC.BAT.

RESOLUTION
==========

LAN Manager version 2.0 is not a supported network for Windows for Workgroups.
You can perform a successful upgrade by removing the references to the LAN
Manager network from AUTOEXEC.BAT before running Windows for Workgroups Setup.
