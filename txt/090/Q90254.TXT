The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Novell/Eagle NE2000 compatible network cards may not work with Windows
for Workgroups if there is an IO address problem. The original NE2000
card supports IO address settings of 300, 320, 340, and 360. The
Windows for Workgroups drivers support the same addresses.

Some clone cards support alternative IO address settings in addition
to these; these additional address settings do not work with our
driver.

To work around the problem, change the IO address to 300, 320, 340, or
360. You will probably have to change some dip switches or jumpers.
