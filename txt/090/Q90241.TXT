The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Workgroup Connections, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Windows for Workgroups or Workgroup Connections pop-up Terminate-
and-stay-resident (TSR) program [started by typing "net start popup" (without the quotation marks)] does not make use of your password
cache. If you reconnect to a shared resource with a password, you will
be prompted for the password again.

The setting Reconnect At Startup only functions as long as the
computer is not turned off or the pop-up TSR is not removed from
memory. After restarting your computer, none of the connections you
had will be maintained. The pop-up TSR will not read the Reconnect=
statement in the SYSTEM.INI file.

Both of these limitations were designed to save conventional memory
usage by the pop-up TSR.
