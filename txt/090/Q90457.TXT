======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft WinLogin, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

There is a documentation error in the "Microsoft WinLogin Administrator's Guide"
regarding the way WinLogin 1.0 manages group administrative settings. Following
the instructions in the administrator's guide will result in the Group settings
not being selected when WinLogin boots on the client machine.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 42 of the "Microsoft WinLogin Administrator's Guide," under the topic
"Managing Group Administrative Settings," step number 5 reads:

   Using Merge Rule Editor, set the merge rule for each entry in the Colors
   section of each WIN.INI file to use the Admin Default Source and to Disallow
   User Preferences.

Following these instructions will result in the Admin (global default) settings
being selected, not the Group settings.

To manage group administrative settings, use the Merge Rule Editor to make the
following merge rule settings for each Group entry in the WIN.INI file:

1. Select Admin as Default Source.

2. Select Replace Default as User Preferences.

NOTE: Any changes made to the local configuration will be saved with the
individual User settings and will override the Group settings.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in WinLogin version 1.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.
