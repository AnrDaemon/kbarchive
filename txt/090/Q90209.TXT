======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install After Dark 2.0 over your Windows for Workgroups installation,
your system may stop responding (hang). You may see the same behavior on other
machines running the Microsoft Windows operating system with network
connectivity.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by After Dark's use of its own PC speaker driver, which disables
interrupts commonly used by network redirectors.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are two ways to avoid this problem:

 - Use a sound adapter and appropriate driver. Then select the setup button in
   the fully installed After Dark product, and select the appropriate sound
   option.

 - After installing After Dark, select the Mute Sound check box from the setup
   dialog box.
