======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your AUTOEXEC.BAT file sets the path to COMMAND.COM using a SET COMSPEC=
statement after the NET START command, then the NET START command may fail with
the following error message and your machine may stop responding (hang):

   invalid or missing command.com

NOTE: This problem DOES NOT occur if COMMAND.COM is in the root directory.

CAUSE
=====

You can set the path to COMMAND.COM with a SHELL= statement in the CONFIG.SYS
file or the COMPSPEC= statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

The NET START command fails only when the path to COMMAND.COM is set via SET
COMSPEC=, not SHELL=. This is more of a problem with MS-DOS version 4.0, which
automatically installs the SET COMPEC= statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, and
with OEM versions of MS-DOS which do not put COMMAND.COM in the root directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

To fix this problem, restart your computer using a startup (boot) disk in drive
A, and edit the CONFIG.SYS and/or AUTOEXEC.BAT files. Move the SET COMSPEC= line
so that it is above the NET START command, or remove the SET COMSPEC= statement
and use the SHELL= line in the CONFIG.SYS file.
