The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If two users attempt to open a JustWrite 2.0 or AMI Pro document at the same
time over the network, both users are able to modify the file, and any changes
made by one of them are lost. The intended behavior is that the first user gets
exclusive access, and the second gets read-only access.

At present, it is recommend that multiple users NOT use these applications with
the same file at the same time, even though the AMI Pro version 2.0 is
advertised as a "Networked" version.


Additional query words: 3.10 3.11
