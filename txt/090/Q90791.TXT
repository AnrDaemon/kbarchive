TITLE   :DOCERR: Minimal SDK Profiler Functions Required
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The directions given in Chapter 10 of the Windows 3.1 SDK "Programming Tools"
manual are followed, but no profiler output is generated.

CAUSE
=====

The "Programming Tools" manual states the following on page 208:

1. Include in your application at least the two mandatory Profiler functions
   ProfStart() and ProfStop().

   ProfStart() indicates when you want Profiler to start sampling code;
   ProfStop() indicates when you want Profiler to stop sampling. Other Profiler
   functions are optional.

This is accurate but not complete. ProfStop() does stop sampling, but it does not
write any output to the disk. Because of this, the Profiler appears to not work.

RESOLUTION
==========

To get the Profiler to function completely, either a call to the Profiler
function ProfFlush() must be made prior to the call to ProfStop(), or the
function ProfFinish() should be used. The documentation would be more accurate
if it stated that the minimum Profile application contained a call to
ProfStart() and a call to ProfFinish(). ProfFinish() stops profile sampling and
flushes the buffer (to disk).
