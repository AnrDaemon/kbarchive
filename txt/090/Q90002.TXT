======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Sound System, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run an MS-DOS based application with Windows Sound System and use the
headphones supplied with Windows Sound System, the volume may be too loud. There
is no way to control the volume while using the headphones with an MS-DOS
application.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows Sound System board is Adlib compatible because it uses the Yamaha
OPL3 chip. Some MS-DOS applications, especially games, use this chip to generate
music. The volume level of the music cannot be controlled by the Windows Sound
System volume control because MS-DOS applications have full control over the
OPL3 chip.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the headphones with a stereo receiver that has a volume control. To connect
Windows Sound System to a stereo receiver, see page 9 of the "Windows Sound
System User's Guide" under the section titled "Connecting Audio Equipment."

-or-

 - Use any volume control on non-Windows Sound System headphones.

-or-

 - Place the headphones on the desk away from your ears.
