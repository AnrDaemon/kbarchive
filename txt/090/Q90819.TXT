SYMPTOMS
========

Font sizes in Microsoft Windows Paintbrush and Microsoft Windows Write do not
match. When you select the same font and size for each application, the results
are different.

CAUSE
=====

Paintbrush and Write measure font sizes differently. Write measures in point
size; Paintbrush measures in pixel lines.

Text in Paintbrush is represented in graphical format, not ASCII, and behaves
much differently than text in Write. Text can be entered at any point on the
application workspace. Changing font and text style in Paintbrush affects the
entire block of text that has been entered since the last insertion. Likewise,
just one backspace deletes an entire block of text, and no new text can be
entered until the text pointer has been reinserted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Paintbrush creates device-independent bitmaps. When you type text in Paintbrush,
it displays and prints the text using bitmaps (even if the font you have
selected is a soft font).

Paintbrush uses screen fonts, and it does not check to see what printer fonts
your printer has. Therefore, you cannot use a font for which you do not have a
screen font. Also, the quality of the text in Paintbrush is lower on laser
printers (even if you have soft fonts) because Paintbrush is using screen fonts
rather than printer fonts on the screen and on printouts.
