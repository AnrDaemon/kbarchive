SUMMARY
=======

If the Windows for Workgroups Setup program detects a CD-ROM drive, it updates
the MSCDEX.EXE file and modifies the corresponding entry in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file. Setup also copies the virtual device driver (VxD) file named LANMAN10.386
to your WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory and adds an entry to your SYSTEM.INI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MSCDEX is a system file required to run a CD-ROM drive.

The LANMAN10.386 virtual device driver is required to enable a CD-ROM to be used
in the Windows environment.
