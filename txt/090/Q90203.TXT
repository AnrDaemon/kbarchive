When you change the adapter settings for the Intel EtherExpress 16 network
adapter in Control Panel, changes are made only to the PROTOCOL.INI file--
they are not written to the card. When you restart your computer, the
EXP16.DOS driver reads the PROTOCOL.INI file for configuration information.
If the PROTOCOL.INI file has settings that are different from those on the
card, the EXP16.DOS driver reconfigures the adapter before initializing it.

NOTE: If you are using two EtherExpress 16 cards in the same machine, you
need to include the settings for both cards in the PROTOCOL.INI file and
then run SoftSet to reconfigure the cards. This allows both cards to bind
correctly when loading the protect mode (NDIS3) drivers.
