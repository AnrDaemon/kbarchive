KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the NetBEUI and Novell NetWare protocols are loaded, and you run the basic
redirector, you get the following error if you attempt to redirect any port
greater than LPT3.

   Error 11: An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format.

When the full redirector is running, you can redirect up to LPT9.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem on a 386 machine or above, unload the basic
redirector and load the full redirector.

There is no workaround to this problem on a 286 machine. You must use LPT1, LPT2,
or LPT3.
