-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Workgroup Connections, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Stacker Electronics Stacker version 2.0 after Windows for
Workgroups or Workgroup Connections, you receive the following error message
when you restart (reboot) your computer:

   PRO0003E: PROTOCOL.INI file open failure. Unable to open PROTOCOL.INI.

CAUSE
=====

Stacker correctly copies PROTMAN.DOS, WORKGRP.SYS, and other system files to the
unstacked drive. The problem occurs because the PROTOCOL.INI file needs to be
copied to the original directory on the unstacked drive.

WORKAROUND
==========

You need to manually copy the PROTOCOL.INI file to the original directory. After
you do this, the PROTOCOL.INI file will be found when the system starts.
