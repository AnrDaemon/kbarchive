-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not
been tested and are not supported by Microsoft.

If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.

SUMMARY
=======

Windows for Workgroups does not include an adapter choice for the Artisoft NE3
8-bit Network card. However, the card can emulate a Western Digital (SMC) 8003,
8-bit network card. There are no physical changes to the card (jumpers)
necessary for emulation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Artisoft NE3 network card is an earlier model and has been out of production
for several years. The configuring software (NE3.EXE) can provide useful
information about the card settings. This information can be seen by typing "NE3
?" (without the quotation marks) from the MS-DOS command line in the NE3
directory.

Important settings for the card include:

 - Interrupt (labeled J10)
   Available interrupts=2/3/4/5/6/7
   Default interrupt=3

 - RamBase (Software configurable)
   Default=D000

 - I/O Base (Labeled J1)
   Default=280

For more information regarding the Artisoft NE3 network card, please contact
Artisoft technical support.
