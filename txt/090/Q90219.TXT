SUMMARY
=======

Some object-linking-and-embedding (OLE) applications provide menu entries and
shortcut key combinations to edit linked objects. When you link an object using
information from another computer's ClipBook, these options are not available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two basic types of OLE objects: linked objects and embedded objects.
Both of these are supported by ClipBook Viewer.

All information that describes an embedded object is held in the ClipBook page,
and can be inserted in a document on another computer. If the application used
to create the information is available on the other computer, the object can be
edited as well.

When an object is linked, the information remains on the computer where it was
created. Links to the object in documents on other computers receive updates of
the information from the originating computer.

Most OLE applications provide the ability to edit an object that has been linked
(not embedded) into another document. This operation is not possible when the
linked object is from another computer. The OLE process depends on access to the
original source file, which in this case resides on another computer.

While the original source file can be made available to others through file
sharing, creating a DDE share does not give others the ability to edit your
source document.

Depending on the applications involved and the security setting, attempting to
edit an object linked from another computer may change the appearance of the
server application (preparing it for editing), or report an error.
