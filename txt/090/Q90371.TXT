The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows for Workgroups fully supports NetBIOS-based applications (such as Lotus
Notes). NetBIOS functionality within Windows for Workgroups is provided by the
NDIS NetBEUI protocol or transport.


Novell NetWare offers NetBIOS support by using a terminate-and-stay- resident
(TSR) program called NETBIOS.EXE. To enable NetBIOS support under Novell
NetWare, NETBIOS.EXE must be loaded.

NOTE: NETBIOS.EXE is not provided with Windows for Workgroups. If you have an
earlier installation of NetWare on your machine, you should be able to use the
NETBIOS.EXE TSR program available from that installation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using the Novell NETBIOS.EXE TSR program with Windows for Workgroups requires
some manual modifications to your AUTOEXEC.BAT and SYSTEM.INI files. The
following steps enable NETBIOS.EXE to support NetBIOS across the MSIPX
transport.

NOTE: Make sure that NETBEUI is at LANA0. If you have IPX (Novell) at LANA0, MSD
cannot recognize NETBIOS. Moving NETBEUI to LANA0 and IPX to LANA1 and using NET
START NETBEUI enables MSD to recognize NETBIOS.

1. Install the NetWare support in Windows for Workgroups. You can do this in the
   Network area in Control Panel.

2. Edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and add "C:\NETWARE\NETBIOS.EXE" (without the
   quotation marks) so that it is loaded after all the following network
   commands:

      net start               <-- WFWG command to initialize network
      msipx.com               <-- WFWG NetWare IPX transport
      netx.com /ps=lanlord    <-- WFWG NetWare shell
      login lanlord/jane      <-- WFWG NetWare login to NetWare server

   Make sure that the NETBIOS.EXE TSR program is loaded before you start Windows.

3. Edit your SYSTEM.INI file in your WINDOWS directory. In the [386Enh] section,
   add the line "V86MODELANAS=0" (without the quotation marks). Under the
   [NETWORK] section add the line "EXCLUDE=0" (without the quotation marks).

4. Restart your machine.
