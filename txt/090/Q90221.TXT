If you choose a font color in Chat that matches the color of Windows
for Workgroups background window (set in Control Panel), you cannot
preview a font (nothing shows up in the Sample field).

To preview a font in Chat, make sure the font color is different from
the background window color. Both the font color and type can be
chosen from the Options menu in Chat.
