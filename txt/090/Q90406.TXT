The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

When you upgrade from Microsoft Windows version 3.1 or 3.11 to Microsoft Windows
for Workgroups version 3.1, your persistent network connections are inherited.
These connections may initially appear dimmed (unavailable) in File Manager
until you select them. You cannot remove these connections using the Disconnect
Network Drive dialog in File Manager, and you cannot manually connect to a path
from the dimmed (unavailable) drives from the Windows command line (that is,
M:\SYS\NOTEPAD.EXE, where M: is a dimmed network drive).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 3.1 stores information about persistent connections in the [network]
section of the WIN.INI file. Windows for Workgroups inherits these connections
for backwards compatibility with other network drivers such as, LANMAN21.DRV,
DUALNET.DRV, NETWARE.DRV, and MS-NET.DRV.

To remove these persistent connections, manually delete them from the WIN.INI
file. You can then go back into the File Manager and connect to the resources,
selecting the Reconnect At Startup check box to make them persistent.

Persistent connection information is stored in the CONNECT.DAT file under Windows
for Workgroups and Workgroup Connections. This file is encrypted, and cannot be
manually edited.
