-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a server from which you are editing a file (for example, a Word for Windows
document) is restarted, the file handle(s) associated with the open file(s) will
no longer be valid. If this happens, you may not be able to continue editing the
file(s), and you will not be able to save them.

The error message you receive when attempting to edit or save the file(s) after
the server is restarted may not accurately indicate the problem. The wording for
the error message is not consistent from one application to another.

WORKAROUND
==========

The only solution is to save a copy of the file to a directory on your computer,
and edit it from there.
