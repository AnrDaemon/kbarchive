-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Workgroup Connections, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If Windows for Workgroups Setup detects a Workgroup Connections
installation, it does not attempt to detect any network information,
but instead copies the information in the PROTOCOL.INI file.

All references to Workgroup Connections drivers and files are replaced
with Windows for Workgroups references. All Workgroup Connections
files are included with Windows for Workgroups, so this presents no
problem except in the case of original equipment manufacturer (OEM)
drivers. Windows for Workgroups Setup does not copy or preserve any
OEM drivers. If OEM drivers were used in the Workgroup Connections
installation, you need to use the OEM disks containing the necessary
drivers during the Windows for Workgroups installation or run Control
Panel after Windows for Workgroups installation.
