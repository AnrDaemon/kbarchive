-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Proteon P-1392 or P-1390 ProNET network cards with Microsoft
Windows or Windows for Workgroups, MS-DOS-based applications loaded from a
network drive may cause the machine to stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

Proteon technical support has confirmed that MS-DOS-based applications may not
run properly in an MS-DOS window when you use the P-1392 or P-1390 ProNET
Proteon network cards with Windows 3.0, 3.0a, or 3.1.

The symptoms occur when the Proteon card is set for bus mastering for a
workstation that is not capable of bus mastering. In this case, the Proteon card
becomes the bus master and takes over all I/O transfers.

WORKAROUND
==========

Set the DMA channel from 5 to 0 on the Proteon card, which changes from a bus
master to a bus slave.

MORE INFORMATION
================
