The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you print from Windows for Workgroups, Print Manager does not allow you to
reorder the first job in the print queue. When Print Manager receives a print
job, it begins to process it immediately, even if the printer queue has been
paused. This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To change the order of print jobs other than the first, use either of the
procedures below:

 - In Print Manager, select the print job you want to reorder. Then, from the
   Document menu, choose Move Document Up or Move Document Down.

   -or-

 - Select the print job, then choose the Move Document Up or Move Document Down
   button on the Print Manager toolbar.

You can only move documents up and down on a printer that is connected to your
computer. If the printer you are using is not connected to your machine, you can
only move a print job down.

NOTE: The "Changing Document Order" section of Program Manager Help describes how
to use the keyboard to change document print order. Using the CTRL+UP ARROW and
CTRL+DOWN ARROW key combinations does not allow you to change the order in which
the documents print.
