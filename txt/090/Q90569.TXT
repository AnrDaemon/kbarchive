SUMMARY
=======

Toshiba product support has confirmed that its T2200SX, T3300SL, T4400SX, and
T6400 laptop computers should be configured in Windows Setup as "MS-DOS System,"
not as "MS-DOS System with APM" or "Intel 386SL Based System with APM."

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although Toshiba laptops have power-saving features to extend battery life, they
do not support Advanced Power Management (APM). To correct the setup:

1. Type "setup" (without the quotation marks) from the WINDOWS directory at the
   MS-DOS command prompt.

2. Choose "MS-DOS System" from the list displayed for the Computer selection.

Setting up any machine for use with the Windows APM support that does not fully
implement the APM specification can cause loss of data, system clock
inaccuracies, or corrupted files.

For more information, contact Toshiba technical support.

The Toshiba products included here are manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
