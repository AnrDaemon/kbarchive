SUMMARY
=======

When running WinLogin 1.0 with 3Com 3+Share, you may encounter problems when
multiple users attempt to access WinLogin's database. To resolve this problem,
increase the number of concurrent file range locks supported by the server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When multiple users attempt to access WinLogin's database, the following error
messages may occur:

   Error opening the database

   Error initializing the database

   Error accessing <one of the tables; user, group, wksta>

Increasing the number of concurrent file range locks supported by the server
solves this problem. Increasing the range locks is done through the 3Com
Optimization program called "3OPT". This program is located in the 3Com server
directory structure. Once you are in this program, one of the screens will be
the "Byte Range Locks" for the different services. This is where the actual
change needs to be done. A system administrator needs to know how this should be
done as well as what to increase it to because there are different scenarios
that will be dealt with, such as memory, services available, and so on.
