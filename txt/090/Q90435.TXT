SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Setup Toolkit, included with version 3.1 of the Microsoft Windows
Software Development Kit (SDK), is documented in the "Setup Toolkit for Windows"
manual, also included with the SDK. Although this book provides a great deal of
reference information about the setup tools, it does not provide a tutorial that
explains how to use the tools.

SETTLKIT contains a text file that describes using the Setup Toolkit and a set of
exercises that build a simple set of installation disks.

The SETTLKIT document demonstrates the basic use of the Microsoft Setup Toolkit,
provided with version 3.1 of the Windows SDK. The Setup Toolkit is a collection
of tools and programs designed to build a "setup" disk--that is, a floppy disk
(or group of disks) that install one or more files onto a client's computer
system.

Because the Setup program itself runs in the Windows environment, the Toolkit is
aimed primarily at building installation disks for applications for the Windows
environment. The Toolkit contains features that allow the setup disks to copy
software and other data files to the target disk, create groups and program
items in the Windows Program Manager, and create or modify profile (.INI) files.
The tutorial does not discuss all of these features; it focuses on using the
Setup disk layout tools and on creating a "basic" setup disk.

The tutorial discusses the following topics:

 - Selecting the files to install on the target system.

 - Including the required Toolkit files on the installation disks.

 - Creating the required directory structure on the target disk.

 - Controlling file compression and decompression.

 - Using the Dsklayt and Dsklayt2 utilities in the Setup Toolkit.

The tutorial uses the sample script file from the Toolkit (with minor
modifications). The tutorial is designed to provide a "feel" for the
capabilities of the Toolkit. To create an installation program for a real
product, additional information is required.
