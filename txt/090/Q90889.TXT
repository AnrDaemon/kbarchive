SUMMARY
=======

If you print a graphic or bitmapped image to a FILE or LPTx.OS2, part of the
output may be truncated. This article discusses possible workarounds for this
problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Printing to a FILE
------------------

When you print a graphic or bitmapped image to a FILE, the CTRL+Z character may
exist in the FILE. Because the CTRL+Z character is misinterpreted by the printer
as an end-of-file marker, part of the graphic image is truncated. Adding the /b
(binary) switch corrects this problem. The syntax for the command is as
follows:

 - COPY <filename.ext> LPTx: /b

   -or-

 - COPY <filename.ext> COMx: /b

Note: This command must be entered at the MS-DOS prompt; it cannot be entered
from within a virtual machine inside Windows.

Adding the /b switch tells the printer that the file is in binary format. As a
result, all the data, including CTRL+Z, is treated as part of the graphic
image.

Printing to LPTx.OS2
--------------------

LPTx.OS2 option does not invoke the /b switch. To print a graphics image, you
must print the graphics image to a FILE with the following steps:

1. In the Control Panel window, choose the Printers icon. Choose the
   Configuration button, and select FILE: as the printer port.

2. Choose the print option within the Windows application from which you are
   trying to print.

3. When you are prompted for a filename, name the file using standard MS-DOS
   conventions. The file is then placed in the current WINDOWS directory. You
   may also choose to include a full path before the filename to save the file
   to a path of your choice.

4. Exit Windows.

5. Move into the WINDOWS directory, or the path specified in step 3, and type
   the following:

    - COPY <filename.ext> LPTx: /b

      -or-

    - COPY <filename.ext> COMx: /b
