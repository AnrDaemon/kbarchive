The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Windows for Workgroups ClipBook Viewer offers the option to "start
application on connect" when a page is shared. This article describes what that
means and when it should be used.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to static information such as a picture or text, some ClipBook pages
contain a reference to the application that the information originated in. If
you use the Paste Link option to paste the contents of this kind of ClipBook
page into an application that supports Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) or OLE, you
establish a DDE or OLE link to the application that created the original
information. The application that the page is paste linked into is the "client"
application, while the application that contains the original information is the
"server" application. While this link is active, the client application receives
any updates to the information if it changes in the server application.

For a link to be established, the server application must be running. The "start
application on connect" check box simply tells the system that it is OK to try
to start this application on your machine when someone on another machine
attempts to establish such a link. If you only want to share information that
you are currently working on, but don't want your work interrupted while the
system restarts the application at some later time, you should not check this
box. If you are sharing information of a more lasting interest or information
that is an important part of other documents in the workgroup, you should check
this box so that you don't have to remember to have this application running at
all times.

NOTE: For the system to start your application, your application must be either:

 - On the PATH if the link that is being established is a DDE link

   -or-

 - Registered as an OLE server in the registration database if the link that is
   being established is an OLE link.
