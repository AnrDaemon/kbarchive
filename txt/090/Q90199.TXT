PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows for Workgroups Setup program may stop responding (hang) when
FASTOPEN.EXE is running.

CAUSE
=====

FASTOPEN.EXE is not compatible with the Setup program.

FASTOPEN.EXE is an MS-DOS-based terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program that
speeds up disk access. It is most effective when used in conjunction with such
applications as compilers and data bases. If you are not running such
applications, you may want to run SMARTDRV.EXE instead.

If you use FASTOPEN.EXE, you should remove it before running Windows for
Workgroups Setup.
