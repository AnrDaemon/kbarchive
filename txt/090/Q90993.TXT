-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows for Workgroups Setup changes the "LASTDRIVE=" setting in CONFIG.SYS to
LASTDRIVE=Z when no other network is present, or to LASTDRIVE=P when installed
with Novell NetWare as the "other" network.

If your custom network setup depends on certain drive letters always being
available, the above changes may cause problems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, if your existing LAN Manager logon script depends on being able to
use certain high drive letters during the logon, and the Windows for Workgroups
Setup changed "LASTDRIVE" from "W" to "P", you may receive the following
errors:

 - Error 85 - local device name already in use

 - Error 15 - System cannot find drive specified

Changing the LASTDRIVE= statement does not ordinarily cause problems like this.
If you are running Novell NetWare and LAN Manager, and experience drive mapping
problems after installing Windows for Workgroups, try setting the LASTDRIVE
statement in the CONFIG.SYS file to the previous value, which should be in
CONFIG.00x.
