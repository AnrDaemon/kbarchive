The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Windows for Workgroups, your computer name does not appear in the Connect
Network Drive dialog box if you set up Windows for Workgroups using the /N
switch (SETUP /N). This happens even if you are running in enhanced mode and can
successfully share directories.

CAUSE
=====

Computer names do not appear in the Show Shared Directories list because they
are running real mode redirectors.

WORKAROUND
==========

In the Path box, type the computer name in UNC format and choose the OK button:

   \\ComputerName

The shares now appear on the list.
