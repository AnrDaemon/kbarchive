The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
 - Microsoft Workgroup Connections, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If the Windows for Workgroups network card device drivers load correctly when
you start your computer, but you cannot see the network when you start Windows
for Workgroups or Workgroup Connections, your network card is probably
improperly configured.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Most network cards have multiple transceiver options. These correspond to the
connectors on the back of the card (BNC, AUI, TP, or twisted pair, and so on).
Make sure the network card is configured to use the connector on the back of the
card to which the network cable is attached.

There are several common ways to configure the connector for a net card. Your
connector probably uses ONE of the following:

 - Jumpers on the card itself. You will need the documentation that came with
   the network card in order to set the jumper to the correct position.

 - Software configurable. These network cards can be configured by running a
   program, that comes with the card and will allow you to change the settings.

 - Set by Parameters in the PROTOCOL.INI file. This is similar to software
   configurable. These settings can be changed with the Windows for Workgroups
   or Workgroup Connections Setup programs.

For a more detailed description of connector types (BNC, AUI, TP, and so on),
please see the Windows for Workgroups installation documentation.

Some other possible causes for this problem:

 - There is an interrupt conflict. Try putting the net card on a different
   interrupt.

 - The network cable is not plugged in to the net card or is loose.

 - The network cable is faulty.

 - The network card is not functioning properly. This can be caused by a
   conflict between the net card and some other device in the system.

 - The network card driver is not functioning properly. Make sure you are using
   the correct version of the network card driver (the one that comes with
   Windows for Workgroups or Workgroup Connections). Some network cards come
   with a disk containing NDIS Network drivers; these may not work correctly.
