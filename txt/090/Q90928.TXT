SUMMARY
=======

This article is a description of the command line switches available with MSIPX
and NETX, which are included with Windows for Workgroups for Novell
connectivity.

NOTE: This information applies to Windows for Workgroups version 3.11, ONLY if
you have upgraded from version 3.1. MSIPX is not included with version 3.11.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MSIPX command line switches:

   /i Displays version information
   /d Displays hardware options
   /o <num> Load using hardware option<num>
   /c=[path]<filename> Use an alternate configuration file
   /? Display help screen

Each of these switches can be activated in one of three ways:

   msipx i   msipx -i   msipx /i

NETX command line switches:

   /? Display shell usage switches
   /I Display shell version and type
   /U Unload the NetWare shell from memory
   /F Forcibly unload the NetWare shell, in spite of TSRs
   loaded after the shell (CAUTION: The /F option could
   hang your workstation)
   /PS=<server> Specify a preferred server
   /C=[path]<filename.ext> Name of your NetWare shell configuration file
   (NOTE: For use with MS-DOS version 3.0 through MS-DOS version 5.0)

Windows for Workgroups includes MSIPX.COM and MSIPX.SYS to provide Novell
connectivity. MSIPX.COM is Novell's IPX.COM bound to a "shim," which looks like
a net card to IPX but provides an NDIS (network driver interface specification)
interface to PROTMAN.DOS (protocol manager). MSIPX.SYS is the stub that binds
the MSIPX transport protocol to the network adapter MAC (media access control)
driver. Windows for Workgroups also ships with NETX.COM, the Novell NetWare
command line shell and redirector. It has not changed from the NETX.COM shipped
with Windows 3.1.
