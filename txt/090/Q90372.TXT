SUMMARY
=======

In Windows 3.1, additional symbolic constants have been defined for use in the
lfOutPrecison field of the LOGFONT data structure. One of the constants,
OUT_TT_PRECIS, is documented incorrectly on page 101 of the Windows SDK
"Programmer's Reference, Volume 2" manual, on page 309 of the "Programmer's
Reference, Volume 3" manual, and in the online help.

The OUT_TT_PRECIS constant is incorrectly documented as follows:

Specifying OUT_TT_PRECIS forces the font mapper to choose a TrueType font
whenever the specified font name matches a device or raster font, even when
there is no TrueType font with the same name.

This paragraph should read as follows:

Specifying OUT_TT_PRECIS forces the font mapper to choose a TrueType font
whenever the specified font name matches both a TrueType font and either a
device or raster font.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The OUT_TT_PRECIS, OUT_RASTER_PRECIS, and OUT_DEVICE_PRECIS values are used by
Windows only when a name collision occurs during font mapping. If more than one
type of font exists with the same name and the application does not specify one
of these values, the font mapper will pick one of them randomly. By using one of
these values, the application can direct the font mapper to the font the
application wants to use.
