The settings for the card can be configured and tested in MS-DOS using the

MORE INFORMATION
================

SOFTSET is a utility program that allows you to configure and test the Intel EE
16 card. The Inel EE 16 works with thick or thin Ethernet cable. The board has a
DIX(15 pin, D-shaped) and a BNC Connector.

If you suspect there is a hardware conflict with the Intel EE 16 card, you may
want to place the card in 8-bit mode. To do this within Windows for Workgroups,
take the following steps:

1. From Control Panel, choose Network.

2. Choose the Adapters button.

3. Select the Intel EE 16 Adapter, then choose the Setup button.

4. Choose the Advanced button.

5. Set I/O Channel Ready to NEVER. This changes the IOCHRDY= line in the
   PROTOCOL.INI to NEVER.

You can also configure other settings on the Intel EE 16 card (that is, IRQ, I/O,
and RAM addresses). For more information on changing the software configurable
settings, consult the documentation for the card.
