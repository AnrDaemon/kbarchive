SUMMARY
=======

If you dedicate a machine in a work group as a file or resource server, there
are two MS-DOS settings you should change:

 - The Files= statement should be increased to 255 on a primary file server. If
   the machine is used less, 128 may be a good value. Some adjustment may be
   necessary.

 - The FCBS= statement should be added with a value of 28.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some problems may occur if the Files= statement is too low. You may receive
error messages stating that a particular file is not available.

If you are not using VSHARE.386 then you should significantly increase the number
of handles and the buffer size of SHARE.EXE.

Additional query words: 3.10
