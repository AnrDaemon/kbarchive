NE 1000 and NE 2000 network cards don't work correctly with Windows
for Workgroups when they are set for interrupt 5 and I/O address 300.
These cards work correctly with Windows for Workgroups if you use any
other setting for interrupt or I/O address. This is documented in the
NE 1000 and NE 2000 manuals.

NOTE: Control Panel allows you to set the card to these two incorrect
settings; therefore, the potential for conflict with Windows for
Workgroups exists.
