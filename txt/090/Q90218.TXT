SUMMARY
=======

When you copy information from the Windows for Workgroups Write application to
the Clipboard and create a ClipBook page out of that information, the appearance
of the information changes and loses special formatting and fonts. This article
explains why.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you copy information from an application to the Clipboard, the information
is copied in one or more formats. Most clipboard viewers, including the
Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 Clipboard viewer and Windows for
Workgroups ClipBook Viewer, are able to display Clipboard data in a limited
number of formats such as text, picture, bitmap, and palette. Write documents
are complicated because they contain a mixture of different fonts, colors, and
special formatting information. Windows provides a separate format, called
OwnerDraw, that allows the Clipboard viewer to display such complex renderings
without knowing everything about the way Write displays its information. When
using this format, the Clipboard viewer communicates with the owner of the
information, such as Windows Write, and that application does all the work and
actually draws within the Clipboard viewer window. The Clipboard viewer simply
notifies Write if the window has been scrolled or needs to be redrawn.

This scheme only works while Write is running. Once you close Write, the
OwnerDraw format is no longer available, and the Clipboard viewer displays the
Write information in the next best format, usually a text format.

When you create a ClipBook page, only information that can be saved is used. The
OwnerDraw format cannot be saved, so application-specific formatting and font
information is lost.
