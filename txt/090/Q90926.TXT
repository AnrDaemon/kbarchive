-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Windows for Workgroups with a network interface card (NIC) that plugs
into the parallel port, device contention errors may occur. (Only two supported
NICs plug into the parallel port: the Xircom Pocket Ethernet I and II.)

CAUSE
=====

These errors occur because Windows for Workgroups sees the LPT port as being
used by two different resources: the network and the printer.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the methods below.

Workaround 1
------------

If you do not need the LPT port for local printing, you can disable the check for
device contention by removing the following line in the SYSTEM.INI file:

        DEVICE=VPD.386

Disabling VPD.386 doesn't affect the ability of Windows for Workgroups to print
over the network. However, if you are printing locally, no warning appears and
printouts may have garbled characters, or you may experience network
communication problems.

Workaround 2
------------

In Control Panel, choose the 386 Enhanced Mode icon. Set the Idle Time for the
port in question to zero (0). This turns off VPD trapping for that port.
