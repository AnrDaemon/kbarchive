KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run version 1.x or 2.0 of Bitstream Facelift under Microsoft Windows,
you may receive a general protection (GP) fault in module FLSYS30.DLL.

CAUSE
=====

This is a problem with Bitstream's FaceLift font package.

WORKAROUND
==========

To prevent this error, Bitstream's technical support suggests deleting and then
reinstalling FaceLift, or upgrading from 1.x to FaceLift 2.0. Versions earlier
than 2.0 were not designed to run under Windows 3.1.

If FaceLift has been disabled, another possible correction is to remove the
[Typefaces] section from the WIN.INI file, and replace the DISPLAY.DRV and
DISPLAY.ORG in the SYSTEM.INI file with an appropriate display driver for the
system. This prevents Windows-based applications from trying to use FaceLift
fonts that are no longer present on the system.
