SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience the following problems when using ClipBook Viewer to share
ClipBook pages:

Page Name Length and Display Problems
-------------------------------------

When you paste from the system Clipboard to the local Clipboard, you are prompted
for a page name. The Paste dialog box limits the page name to 47 characters.
However, in the local ClipBook window, the page name is displayed as a
46-character string. Throughout the ClipBook Viewer dialog boxes, the page name
may or may not be truncated by one or a half of a character. When you attempt to
connect to another shared ClipBook page with a 47-character name, only about 35
characters are visible. These problems do not prevent you from sharing pages or
connecting to shared pages.

Incorrect Positioning of Computer and Page Names
------------------------------------------------

In the Enter Network Password dialog box, the Computer Name and Page Name fields
are not centered properly. Both names appear half a character higher than
normal.

No Context Sensitive Help in Enter Network Password Dialog Box
--------------------------------------------------------------

When you attempt to connect to a shared ClipBook page that requires a password,
no context-sensitive help (F1) is available. The Help button functions
normally.

Same Passwords for Full and Read-Only Access
--------------------------------------------

When you set the passwords for full and read-only access to your shared ClipBook
pages, ClipBook allows you to use the same password for both types of access.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed these to be a problems in Windows for Workgroups
ClipBook Viewer version 3.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
