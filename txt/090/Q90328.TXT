The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After you install Windows for Workgroups on a computer running Microsoft LAN
Manager version 2.1, you may notice a change in available conventional memory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This may be caused by having DYNAMIC=YES in the [PROTMAN] section of the
PROTOCOL.INI file. The DYNAMIC=YES command causes PROTMAN.DOS to allocate memory
to facilitate demand protocol architecture (DPA). Because Windows for Workgroups
does not provide DPA functionality, this memory is wasted.

To recover the memory used for DPA, change DYNAMIC=NO, or remove the line all
together.

DPA was first implemented with LAN Manager 2.1, and PROTMAN 2.0. DPA allows for
the dynamic loading/binding and unloading/unbinding of protocols under MS-DOS.
