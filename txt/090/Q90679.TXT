MORE INFORMATION
================

Mail 3.0a
---------

 - Modified EXTERNAL.EXE so that it correctly transfers mail to postoffices when
   using dynamic drives.

 - Modified IMPORT.EXE so that it correctly imports SNADS and PROFS addresses
   into the postoffice address list when the -A parameter is used.

Mail 3.0b
---------

MS-DOS Client:

 - Modified the MS-DOS client to work correctly with the MS-DOS 5.0 Task
   Swapper.

 - Resolved some international issues.

Windows/PM Client:

 - Added the ability to Import/Export folders. This was done through the use of
   a custom command.

 - Added auto detection/correction of a damaged mail message file (MMF).

 - Added the ability to read, write, and delete messages in group folders.

 - Resolved problems with displaying the template information of gateway users.

 - SHARE is no longer required when the MMF is stored on the server. If the MMF
   is local, then SHARE is still required.

 - Resolved some problems with SETUP.EXE.

 - Resolved problems with Windows hanging when trying to exit Windows. If
   Windows was closed with Mail still loaded, the system could hang.

 - Resolved the problem with not being able to access an attachment in a message
   that comes from a shared folder, when the originator is using the Macintosh
   client.
