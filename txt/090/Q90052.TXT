-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run Windows version 3.1 in 386 Enhanced or Standard Mode while connected
to Banyan Vines network version 4.10 or 5.00, and you attempt to run an
MS-DOS-based application, the following error message may be displayed:

   The switch has been prevented. Cannot start application.

CAUSE
=====

This error message may occur because Windows has not been set up with the proper
network driver, or is set up for "No Network" (without the quotation marks).

WORKAROUND
==========

After receiving the above error message, check the maintenance mode of the
Windows Setup program, and make sure the system setting for Network is Banyan
VINES (and the appropriate version). If it is not, change the setting using
either of the following methods:

1. Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main group in Program Manager.

2. From the Options menu, select "Change System Settings..."

3. Select "Banyan VINES (Version 4.1 or Version 5.0)" from the available
   choices, and follow the instructions from the Setup program.

- OR -

1. Exit Windows.

2. Change to the current Windows subdirectory, and type

   setup

3. Use the arrow keys to highlight the network information, and press the ENTER
   key.

4. Select "Banyan VINES (version 4.1)" and press ENTER.

5. Press ENTER to accept the configuration, then follow the instructions from
   the Setup program.

If Banyan VINES (Version 4.1) is your selected network, and you still receive the
error message above, then your setup probably failed. Try removing and
reinstalling support for network as follows:

1. Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main group in Program Manager.

2. From the Options menu, select "Change System Settings..."

3. Select "No Network Installed" from the available choices, then follow the
   instructions from the Setup program.

4. Run Windows Setup again.

5. From the Options menu, select "Change System Settings..."

6. Select "Banyan VINES (version 4.1)" from the available choices, then follow
   the instructions from the Setup program.
