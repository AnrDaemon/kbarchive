The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can manipulate network printers from either Control Panel or Print Manager.
However, the capabilities provided from these applications differ greatly. You
can perform only some network printer operations from Control Panel, whereas you
can perform all possible operations from Print Manager.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Control Panel, the network driver provides only the minimal support needed
for making a new network connection when setting up a printer for the first
time. This is for backward compatibility with Microsoft Windows version 3.1 and
for use when running Windows for Workgroups Setup. (Note you might not make
network connections during Windows for Workgroups Setup because the network
driver is not loaded during installation.)

Print Manager provides full functionality for printer configuration, including
connecting to and disconnecting from network printers and managing documents in
network print queues.

Some rules apply to the managing of network print queues:

 - On a locally connected printer, regardless of the shared status, any print
   job can be deleted. Print jobs sent across the network can only be paused.

 - On a locally connected printer, the topmost (currently printing) job cannot
   be moved. All locally submitted print jobs must remain above all network jobs
   in the queue. Therefore, the topmost network job cannot be moved up, and the
   bottommost local job cannot be moved down. At least three local jobs or at
   least two remote jobs must be in a queue before you can reposition any print
   job. (Note: Queue management menu items and buttons are not always dimmed
   when the options fail because of these rules.)

 - On a network (shared) printer, you can only pause and delete your own print
   jobs, and then only before they start printing. You can only move your print
   job down in the queue, and only before it starts printing.
