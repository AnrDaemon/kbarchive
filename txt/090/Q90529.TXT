-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Windows for Workgroups application NetWatcher, the server may
notice a single user connected several times, each time opening the same file.
This is normal for a user using Schedule+.

CAUSE
=====

This situation is caused by running Schedule+ and the Schedule+ Reminders
program. Each would have the user's schedule file open. If the user then has a
meeting request from another user open, the file is opened a third time.

This behavior is by design.
