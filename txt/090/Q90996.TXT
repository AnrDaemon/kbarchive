SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 for a Microsoft
compatible network and Workgroup Connections, you may receive network errors in
Print Manager for redirected printer ports. The message "Network error" appears
beside network print queues.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a conflict with MSNET.DRV.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Workgroup Connections version 1.0
and Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS version 3.11. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here as it becomes available.
