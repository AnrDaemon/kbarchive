TITLE   :BUG: Friction and Factor PWB Switches do not work
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:2.1.49
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, version 2.1.49 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Friction and Factor switches do not work in Programmer's WorkBench (PWB)
version 2.1.49.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Friction switch, together with the Factor switch, control how quickly PWB
executes a fast function (see the "Environment and Tools" manual for information
on the Fastfunc switch). A fast function is a PWB function whose action repeats
rapidly when you hold down the associated key.

On many computers, the keyboard repeat rate is much too fast by default. The
intention of the Friction and Factor switches is to slow the keyboard repeat
rate. These switches do not work in PWB 2.1.49.

To adjust the keyboard rate, do the following:

1. From the Options menu, choose Editor Settings.

2. In the Editor Settings box, select the "text" option.

3. Turn off all the Fastfunc settings in the Switch List box by toggling "on" to
   "off." For example, you should see the editor setting:

   Fastfunc: emacscdel on

   This statement would normally allow the Friction and Factor switches to
   control the speed of the BACKSPACE key assigned to the Emacscdel function.
   Change this to:

   " Fastfunc: emacscdel off" (without the quotation marks)

By turning off Fastfunc settings, you will enable Windows or MS-DOS to set the
key repeat rate.

In Windows, you can adjust the key repeat rate with the keyboard icon in the
control panel. This will affect all applications that run within Windows.

If you are running MS-DOS outside of Windows, you can adjust the key repeat rate
(also known as the typematic rate) by using the MODE command. For example, the
MS-DOS command

   mode con rate=1 delay=4

specifies a rate of approximately two characters a second after a delay of 1
second.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Programmer's WorkBench version
2.1.49.

MORE INFORMATION
================

More information about setting keyboard repeat rates can be found in your MS-DOS
manual (see MODE command) and in the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" (see
Control Panel).

For more information about the Friction, Factor, and Fastfunc editor settings,
see the "Environment and Tools" manual.
