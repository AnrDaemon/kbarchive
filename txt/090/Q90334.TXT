SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the use of the Windows for Workgroups NET TIME command
under versions 3.1 and 3.11.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using NET TIME Under Windows for Workgroups Version 3.1
-------------------------------------------------------

The NET TIME command can be used in Windows for Workgroups 3.1 only if you have a
LAN Manager version 2.0 or 2.1 server installed as a secondary network. This
command synchronizes the clocks of computers in a workgroup to a LAN Manager
server that has a shared clock.(If there is no shared clock, you can't use the
NET TIME command.)

To synchronize the clocks of all the computers in a workgroup with a shared clock
on a LAN Manager server, type the following at an MS-DOS command prompt

   net time /workgroup:<workgroup name>

where <workgroup name> is the workgroup on which you want the clocks to be
synchronized.

For information about how to share a clock on a LAN Manager server or peer
workstation, see the "LAN Manager Installation and Configuration Guide."

Using NET TIME Under Windows for Workgroups Version 3.11
--------------------------------------------------------

Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 allows you to synchronize your computer's
clock with a Windows NT, or LAN Manager server (with a shared clock) using the
NET TIME command. For specific instructions, type "net time /?" (without the
quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.
