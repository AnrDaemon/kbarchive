SUMMARY
=======

Vi-Spy is a virus-protection application capable of running in both Windows and
MS-DOS environments. For Windows to work properly with Vi-Spy, you must run the
Windows-based Setup utility provided on the Vi-Spy Setup disks.

NOTE: Failure to do so may cause MS-DOS-based applications to stop responding
(hang) when started from within Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Vi-Spy virus protection software comes with separate installation programs for
MS-DOS and Windows. Both programs should be run before using Vi-Spy with
Windows. The MS-DOS Setup utility places the RVS.EXE terminate-
and-stay-resident (TSR) in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The Windows-based Setup
utility places the RVSWIN.EXE TSR in the LOAD= line of the WIN.INI file.

RVSWIN.EXE is necessary to resolve memory conflicts with RVS.EXE when running
under Windows. If the Windows-based Setup utility is not run, or RVSWIN.EXE is
removed from the LOAD= line of the WIN.INI file, Windows may hang when an
MS-DOS-based application or MS-DOS Prompt is executed from within Windows.

To ensure that the Vi-Spy virus-protection software is installed correctly,
contact RG Software Systems technical support.

Vi-Spy is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty,
implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or reliability.
