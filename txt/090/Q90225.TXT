The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Workgroup Connections, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The network detection portion of Windows for Workgroups Setup will not
be executed if WRKGRP.SYS is present in the CONFIG.SYS file. Setup
looks for WRKGRP.SYS before attempting to detect the type of network
and adapter currently installed. If it finds WRKGRP.SYS, it assumes
Workgroup Connections is installed. It then looks for the network
information from the Workgroup Connections directory. If this happens,
remove WRKGRP.SYS from the CONFIG.SYS file and run Setup again.
