The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh, versions 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The automatic slide-numbering (##), date (//), and time (::) markers are
recognized by Microsoft PowerPoint only when they are placed on the Slide
Master. If the Slide Master is omitted (or not followed), the automatic date,
time, and page numbers do not appear when you run a slide show or print the
slide.

To insert automatic date, time, or page numbers, follow the steps for your
version of PowerPoint.

PowerPoint 7.0
--------------

1. On the Insert menu, click Date, Time, or Page Numbers.

2. The ##, //, or :: symbols appear on your slide. Drag them to the desired
   location.

PowerPoint 3.0 and 4.0
----------------------

1. On the Edit menu, click Insert. In the list of options, select Date, Time, or
   Page Number.

2. The ##, //, or :: symbols appear on your slide. Drag them to the desired
   location.

If you omit the background items of the Master slide, the date, time, and page
numbers will not be used. If you want the date, time, or page numbers to be
printed or displayed on a slide for which you are not following the Master's
background items, you must enter them manually onto the slide.

NOTES:

In PowerPoint 4.0 and later, click either Slide Background or Slide Color Scheme
on the Format menu to specify which elements you want to have follow (or differ
from) the Master. Note that you cannot omit Master slide items with the Slide
Color Scheme command; you must use the Slide Background command.

In PowerPoint 3.0, to determine which aspects of the Master your presentation or
slide is following, click Follow Master on the Slide menu and notice which items
have check marks beside them. You can choose to follow or ignore the following
aspects of the Master:

 - Color Scheme

 - Background Items

 - Title Style

 - Body Style
