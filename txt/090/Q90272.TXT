SUMMARY
=======

In Windows for Workgroups, Print Manager notifies the user of printing errors
differently than in earlier versions of Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Most errors, such as "printer out of paper," no longer are displayed in a dialog
box. This is so print spooling doesn't halt. Instead of a dialog box, the print
queue is marked as being in an "error state." A descriptive error message
displays in the Print Manager status bar. When the error is corrected, the print
queue can be restarted by choosing Resume Printing Document from the Document
menu.

The options for error notification in the Background Printing dialog box refer to
driver specific situations such as a plotter requiring a pen change. These
messages are displayed as configured in the dialog box.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.11
