SUMMARY
=======

Mail message files vary in size, depending on the size and type of messages
stored in the file. Folders and the Personal Address Book also take additional
space in the mail message file (MMF).

MORE INFORMATION
================

An empty mail message file is about 43K in size. The mail message file grows
with each additional Message, Folder, and Personal Address Book entry.

There are about 128 bytes overhead for each message and about 256 bytes overhead
for each attachment or object-linking-and-embedding (OLE) object in a message.
Because there is no real data compression in the mail message file, a message
containing 100K of information actually adds 100K plus the message overhead to
the mail message file.

Each folder adds from 42 to 300 bytes to the mail message file.

Personal Address Book entries are stored in the mail message file. One Personal
Address Book entry of 500 characters would add about 720 bytes to the mail
message file.
