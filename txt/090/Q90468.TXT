TITLE   :Garbled Characters and Beeping in WFWG When Starting NetBEUI

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you load SMARTDrive high and start NetBEUI from MS-DOS by typing "net start
netbeui" (without the quotation marks), garbled characters may scroll on the
screen and the system may start beeping.

You can press the CTRL+BREAK keys to get back the MS-DOS command prompt. If you
type "net start netbeui" (without the quotation marks) again, NetBEUI should
load correctly.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when NetBEUI tries to increase (grow) its data segment size
and fails. NetBEUI tries to increase its data segment when the PROTOCOL.INI file
has high values (around 90) for the NCBS= and SESSIONS= statements.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, load SMARTDrive low or lower the NCBS= and
SESSIONS= statements to 12 and 32, respectively.
