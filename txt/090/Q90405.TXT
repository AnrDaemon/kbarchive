SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Excel version 4.0 is a Mail-enabled application.

Excel 4.0 uses the Simple Messaging Application Program Interface (MAPI) to
invoke the Send Mail feature. To enable this feature, add the following to the
WIN.INI file:

   "[Mail]
   Mapi=1" (without the quotation marks)

To remove the Send Mail function in Excel 4.0, edit the WIN.INI file as follows:

   "[Mail]
   Mapi=0" (without the quotation marks)

NOTE: Setting MAPI=0 will disable all other Mail-enabled applications, such as
File Manager and Word.

Additional query words: 3.00
