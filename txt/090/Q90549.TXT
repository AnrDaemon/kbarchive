SUMMARY
=======

By default, the Novell NetWare shell NETX.COM by resets the local workstation
time to match that of the default (or preferred) server when loaded. If that
server is in a different time zone, or otherwise has a different time-of-day (or
date) than the local workstation, the local workstation's system clock may be
reset to match the server's date and time.

This behavior can be avoided by placing the following command in the
workstation's SHELL.CFG file:

   SET STATION TIME=OFF

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Novell NetWare redirector (shell) NETX.COM (or equivalent) must be installed
to allow connectivity to a Novell LAN. When NETX loads, it attaches the
workstation to a default server, or a preferred server as specified by the user
or network administrator.

When the server is attached, NETX.COM by default resets the local workstation's
date and time to match that of the server. If the server resides in a different
time zone, or maintains a different date or time-of-day than that of the local
workstation, the resetting of the workstation clock may result in an incorrect
date and/or time relative to local time.

To override the resetting of the local workstation time, the above line should be
added to the SHELL.CFG file.

The SHELL.CFG file is an ASCII text file and may be created and/or edited using
any text editor, such as the MS-DOS 5.0 EDIT command, or the Windows for
Workgroups Notepad program. NETX.COM should then be loaded in the following
manner to read the configuration file:

   NETX /C=[drive:][\path\]SHELL.CFG

This instructs NETX to load and read the SHELL.CFG file from the drive and
directory specified for proper configuration information. If SHELL.CFG is
properly recognized, a verification appears that these features are enabled when
the NetWare shell loads.

For more information on other SHELL.CFG options, see the "NetWare Supervisor
Reference Guide." Note that some SHELL.CFG options are new and will not be
present in earlier versions of the NetWare documentation.
