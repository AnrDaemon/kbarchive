The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Novell's NetWare Tools for Windows, you have no network
functionality for Windows for Workgroups.

CAUSE
=====

When you load Netware Tools, it replaces the NETWORK.DRV= line in the [Boot]
section of the SYSTEM.INI file. This prevents the Windows for Workgroups network
driver, WFWNET.DRV, from being loaded. Without this driver, there is no network
functionality for Windows for Workgroups.

WORKAROUND
==========

To fix this problem, you need to specify WFWNET.DRV in the NETWORK.DRV= line of
your SYSTEM.INI file.

1. Open your SYSTEM.INI with at text editor, and change the line from

         network.drv=netware.drv

   to:

         network.drv=wfwnet.drv

2. Save your changes and restart your system. Windows for Workgroups functions
   correctly.
