-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Windows for Workgroups, if you print to a remote printer from an
application installed on another server (that is, if the application
is not running from your local hard drive), you receive no
notification if a printer error occurs.

By contrast, if the application is installed locally on your machine
(the client) and a printer error occurs on a remote printer, you DO
receive notification of that error.

The error message appears on the print server, in Print Manager, but
Windows for Workgroups does not notify the client of the problem.
