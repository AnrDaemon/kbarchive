SUMMARY
=======

The Workgroup Connections SYSTEM.INI file contains switches used to control the
behavior of various Workgroup Connections network components.

The switches control such things as where to find certain files, sizes of some
buffers used by the redirector, and flags that alter default behavior of
Workgroup Connections features and default parameters used by the NET command.

Most switches are found in the [Network] section, which is analogous to the
[network] section in the Windows for Workgroups SYSTEM.INI file.
