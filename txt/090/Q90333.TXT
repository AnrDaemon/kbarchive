-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows for Workgroups (WFWG), the screen may become garbled
momentarily after the logo and wallpaper appear. After a few seconds, or if the
mouse is moved, the screen restores the wallpaper and the Windows for Workgroups
login dialog appears.

CAUSE
=====

Some third-party video drivers write to the display to reset. These drivers
attempt to write to the display in a manner that matches the Windows startup
screen, so you do not notice. Because Windows for Workgroups has made changes to
Windows startup, you see the video driver reset.

WORKAROUND
==========

To solve this problem, replace the video driver on your computer with a video
driver included with Windows for Workgroups.
