The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for MS-DOS, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The WP variable in the CONFIG.FX file specifies the text editor for memo fields
in FoxBASE+. This variable may specify a third-party editor to create and edit
memo fields.

For example, to edit memo fields with Microsoft Word, place the following line in
the CONFIG.FX file:

      WP=C:\WORD\WORD.EXE

To load a work processor with FoxBASE+, enough conventional memory to load both
FoxBASE+ and the word processor is required. (FoxBASE+ uses 512K and requires a
minimum of 360K free memory.) FoxBASE+ cannot remove itself from memory to free
space for the word processor. When the user attempts to load the word processor
and not enough memory is free, an

   Insufficient Memory

error occurs.

To make additional memory available, modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files
to remove unnecessary drivers and terminate-and-stay-resident programs from
memory.
