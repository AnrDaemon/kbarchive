======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft WinLogin, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running Microsoft WinLogin on a workstation (client) and exiting or saving
the current configuration, you may receive the following error message:

   WINLOGIN caused a General Protection Fault in module WLDAPI.DLL at 0001:AFB3

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs if the length of any key (entry on the left side of the equal
sign) in an .INI file that WinLogin is managing exceeds 63 characters in length.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this error, make sure that there are no key entries exceeding 63
characters in length in any .INI file managed by WinLogin.

For example:

   [DummySection]
   ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJK=1
   ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKL=1

The first entry is a valid key (63 characters), while the second entry (64
characters) is not and results in the general protection (GP) fault.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
