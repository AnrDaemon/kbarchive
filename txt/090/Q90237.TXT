SYMPTOMS
========

When you are printing from an MS-DOS-based application that is NOT set up to run
in the background (through a .PIF file), AD-DOS suspends the print job.

CAUSE
=====

AD-DOS.COM is a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program that comes with
Berkeley System's After Dark. When loaded, it allows After Dark to run a screen
saver when you are running MS-DOS Prompt in full screen mode.

When you are printing from MS-DOS Prompt and AD-DOS activates, the print jobs are
suspended until the system receives keyboard or mouse input to clear AD-DOS.

The print job is not harmed in any way; it is just suspended until the screen
saver is cleared from the screen.

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid the problem, do one of the following:

 - Do not load AD-DOS.COM.

 - Set up the application to run in the background in a .PIF file.

 - Set the AD-DOS time-out period to a high value so the current print jobs can
   finish.

 - Press a key or move the mouse occasionally to prevent AD-DOS from activating.

After Dark is manufactured by Berkeley Systems, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
