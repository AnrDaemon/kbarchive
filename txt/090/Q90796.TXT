SUMMARY
=======

In the enhanced mode Windows environment, both TSRs (terminate-and-stay-
resident programs) and VxDs (virtual device drivers) can ask the operating
system for areas of instanced data in the V86-mode addressable virtual memory
range. This article describes the algorithm that the VMM (virtual memory
manager) employs to determine the memory layout as well as some implications
arising from that approach.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because the smallest unit of memory for which the Intel i386+ processor provides
support to the operating system is 4K and the total addressable range in V86
mode is 0 - FFFF:F (including the virtual high memory area), the memory range of
each virtual machine is associated with 0x10F pages that the VMM can maintain.
Each of these pages is associated with a number of flags; the following are
relevant for this discussion:

 - global (PG_SYS); meaning that this page is being mapped onto the same
   physical page in every virtual machine; thus, changing the contents of that
   page in one VM will affect the corresponding page in all VMs. By default, all
   TSRs that were active before enhanced mode Windows started up are considered
   global, as well as the images of the BIOS and MS-DOS system code.

 - local (PG_VM); meaning that that page is maintained in the context of that VM
   only. Changes in these pages in one VM do not affect other VMs unless the
   mapping has been changed by a VxD.

 - instanced (PG_INSTANCE); meaning data that is generally being operated on by
   code in global pages but needs to have local instances in each VM. For
   example, MS-DOS keeps a variable in which it stores the current working
   directory. Although the code that works on this variable is global, the data
   itself is local so that each VM can operate in the context of a different
   current working directory.

Because TSR code is not generally designed to be aligned on 4K boundaries, each
page labeled PG_INSTANCE typically contains a mixture of instanced and global
data. Windows requires that all instanced data be identified at system
initialization time; once this task is completed, Windows sets up a data
structure that contains the locations of instance data areas PG_INSTANCE marked
pages. The contents of the instanced data structures present at Windows startup
time will be saved into a snapshot buffer and restored from that buffer at
Windows termination time.

Each VM will then be associated with an instance buffer that will initially
contain a copy of the data in the snapshot buffer. Using a copy-on-write scheme
that is supported by the faulting mechanism provided by the hardware, Windows
updates a VM's instance buffer once write access has been detected to a
PG_INSTANCE page (note that this is absolutely unrelated to the paging
mechanism, although page faults are involved to implement this technique).
Because only parts of an instance page are being updated, fragmented and large
instance areas decrease the performance of the swapping mechanism. Note that
VMs' instance buffers are not accessible to VxDs or TSRs; they are local data
structures to be accessed by the VMM only.

One consequence of this approach is that changes that are made to instanced data
while in Windows are lost after Windows terminates because the startup snapshot
is restored then. For example, if files opened with handles are open before
Windows enhanced mode starts up, these files should not be touched while Windows
is running, because the internal structures that represent the files in MS-DOS
are instanced.

Using the Windows termination notification broadcasts Interrupt 2fh, ax=1606h,
and 1609h, respectively, a TSR could override the snapshot taking by providing a
snapshot buffer of its own. That buffer would have to reside in global memory,
that is, in the TSR itself, and would be allocated and filled while the TSR
processes the 1609h broadcast; at 1606h time, the TSR could "undo" the
restoration Windows did from its snapshot buffer. However, this technique
requires knowledge of the internal structures of MS-DOS that are to be
manipulated and is therefore not recommended.

When running the debug version of WIN386.EXE under control of the WDEB386
debugger, the .mi command allows you to examine the currently active instanced
areas.

The inspiration for this article and some of the information, in particular the
last chapter, comes from NeilSa (who else?).

The real interesting information starts here. I have grepped through the sources
and put together a small (and incomplete) list of DOS-stuff that is instanced.
It's MS-DOS 5 and Win 3.1 only. Note that OEMs can use the [386Enh] switch
USEINSTFILE to tell Windows about more of their MS-DOS version's data to
instance. All of the stuff is in the dosmgr VxD. TSRs instancing data do so in
response to int 2fh, ax=1605 - this is resolved to a call to AddInstanceItem, so
all instancing goes through the code (vmm\int2fapi.asm). Very convenient! The
only other VMM service that calls into AddInstanceItem is AllocateGlobalV86 area
with the GVDAInstance flag set.

This is the (again, incomplete) list of data items instanced by the MS-DOS
Manager:

-> The BIOS memory size variable that contains the memory size as
returned by int 12 (normally 40:13)
-> The DOS memory arena
-> A chunk of self-modifying code from the DOS loader (conspirative
patch #14)
-> Single drive management byte (504h)
-> V86 interrupt vector table (addresses 0 - 3ffh)
-> Extra DOS data from internal DOS tables
-> BIOS data from internal DOS tables
-> DOS swappable area
-> Current directory string
-> System file table
-> DOS stack
-> Last link in SFT table; VM1 grows SFT; shouldn't be seen in other
-> SF_FLAGS in CONs SFT; accessed by COMMAND.COM
-> Device header list (so that Windows can locally add DOS drivers
-> All devices found under *local=* in SYSTEM.INI but not *global=*

Data instanced by the virtual keyboard driver:

-> 40 bytes following address 415h (hard coded - keyboard buffer &
status)
-> one byte at address 471h (hard coded - break bit)
-> 4 bytes at address 480h (hard coded - buffer)
-> 11 bytes at 496h (hard coded - enhanced keyboard status)

Data instanced by the virtual comm device:

-> 8 bytes following address 400h (where the comm ports' port address
are stored)
-> 4 bytes at address 4fch (time-out value)

Data instanced by the virtual printer device (if installed -- has been nuked):

-> 3 bytes at address 478h (time-out values)

Also, VMD instanced the DOS mouse driver if it is found by following int 33h;
almost all virtual video drivers instance data. The virtual EMM provide
instances the segment that contains the real mode XMS entry point, and VNETWARE
instances its redirector table.

Just in case you're interested. Note also that the loadhi VxD hooks into the
AddInstanceItem call and processes all instanced data in UMBs itself.
