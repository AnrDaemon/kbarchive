-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft WinLogin, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft WinLogin on a workstation (client) and exit or save the
current configuration, you may receive the following error message:

   An error occurred while saving changes to Win.ini

CAUSE
=====

This error is displayed if the Microsoft TrueType Font Pack is installed on the
workstation running WinLogin. It is caused by the large number of long font
names placed in the WIN.INI file by the Microsoft TrueType Font Pack
installation.

This error may also occur if a large number of long key entries (on the left side
of the equal sign) exist in any section of any .INI file that is being managed
by WinLogin.

If the sum of all the characters in all the key entries within a given section,
plus one character for each key, exceeds 2046, you receive the following error
message when WinLogin saves a standard .INI file:

   An error occurred while saving changes to <filename>.ini

This condition is likely to occur when a large number of font entries are added
to the [fonts] section of WIN.INI, although if the limit is exceeded in any
section of any .INI file managed by WinLogin, the error occurs.

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid this error, reduce the length or number of entries in the appropriate
section of the appropriate .INI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error prevents updated information in the offending section and any section
that follows that section from being saved to the configuration files maintained
by WinLogin on the designated network server. Also, if the WinLogin client
software is configured to "Log Unknown Settings," these settings are not logged
in the appropriate .DIF file. At this time, there are no other known
consequences resulting from this error. Moving the offending section to the end
of the .INI file minimizes the impact of this error.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
