 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Intel EtherExpress (EE) 16 network card, included in some Windows for
Workgroup packages, has a 32K RAM buffer. The default configuration for Windows
for Workgroups does not use this buffer (base memory address is set to Automatic
Or Unused).

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use the 32K buffer with Windows for Workgroups, you would have to use the
Intel SoftSet utility (SOFTSET.EXE) to change the memory mapping option to
Memory Mapped, and then modify the NETWORK.INF file to enable the option by
default when installing Windows for Workgroups. This configuration is not as
reliable or as fast (on this card configuration) as the I/O memory mapping
(Automatic Or Unused) that is set up by default, and is not supported by
Microsoft.

The Intel EtherExpress (EE) 16 network card is shipped with the following Windows
for Workgroup packages:

 - Windows for Workgroups Network Starter Kit (software and hardware for two)

 - Windows for Workgroups Network User Kit (software and hardware for one)

 - Windows for Workgroups 3.1 Addon Network Starter Kit (software and hardware
   for two existing 3.1 users)

 - Windows for Workgroups 3.1 Addon User Kit (software and hardware for one
   existing 3.1 user)
