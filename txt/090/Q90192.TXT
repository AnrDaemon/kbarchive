SUMMARY
=======

problems when used with Microsoft Windows 3.1. The problem is in the circuit
card, which can be upgraded by contacting DataProducts.

This problem does not occur with Windows 3.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although the DataProducts LZR 650 can emulate the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet
Series II, or the Epson FX-80, or the IBM Graphics Printers, these emulations
are not workarounds for the printing problem. The only workaround is to upgrade
the circuit card.
