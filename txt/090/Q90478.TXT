SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.0 of Microsoft Excel uses a macro supplied with Microsoft Mail for
Windows, version 3.0, to perform the Send Mail function.

During installation of Mail for Windows, if Excel 3.0 is detected as being
installed on the workstation, the Mail installation program copies the macro
SMI.XLA to the EXCEL\XLSTART directory. If Excel 3.0 is not detected, SMI.XLA
copies to the Mail executables directory.

To enable the Mail capabilities of Excel 3.0, copy SMI.XLA from the Mail
executables directory to the EXCEL\XLSTART directory.

To disable this feature, delete or rename the SMI.XLA file located in the
EXCEL\XLSTART directory.
