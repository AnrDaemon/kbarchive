SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Leading Technology PC Partner computer with Microsoft Windows
with the standard VGA driver installed, text is garbled after exiting Windows.

The problem exists in both standard and enhanced mode. The screen continually
displays binary characters or the video display is garbled after exiting
Windows. The system then hangs and the only way to continue is to restart the
computer.

WORKAROUND
==========

Using the VGA (version 3.0) video driver supplied with Windows 3.1 corrects this
problem.
