SUMMARY
=======

Once a graphic has been saved in the segmented-hypergraphic (.SHG) file format,
the appearance of the graphic can no longer be edited.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The .SHG file format is not supported by any graphics editors, and therefore it
is impossible to load a segmented hypergraphic into a graphics editor to alter
the original image. To work around this problem, a copy of the original graphic
must be archived before creating the segmented hypergraphic. If the display
needs to be altered, then the archived graphic may be edited. To copy the hot
spots to the edited graphic, two instances of the segmented hypergraphic (hot
spot) editor, SHED.EXE, need to be opened. The first instance should contain the
original .SHG file with all of the hot spots in place. The second instance
should contain the edited graphic. The hot spots can be copied from the original
.SHG file to the new graphic using the Copy and Paste commands available in the
Hotspot Editor.
