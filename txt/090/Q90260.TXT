The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not
been tested and are not supported by Microsoft.

If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.

SUMMARY
=======

When Windows for Workgroups is configured for DECNet Protocol on Lana 0, and
NetBEUI on Lana 1, running NetBIOS applications on Lana 0 may require that you
increase the NETHEAPSIZE= entry [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The default setting is NETHEAPSIZE=20. You may have to increase it to a value
greater than 24. Try incrementing this value by 10 or 20 until your NetBIOS
application behaves correctly.

DECNet is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty,
implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or reliability.
