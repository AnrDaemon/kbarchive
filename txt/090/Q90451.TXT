TITLE   :NetWare NCOPY to Local Drive Gives Sharing Violation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running Microsoft Windows for Workgroups in 386 enhanced mode or
standard mode with the MS-DOS SHARE utility loaded, or you are running Windows
95, and you use the Novell NetWare version 3.11 NCOPY command to copy files to a
local disk drive, you may receive the following error message

   Sharing violation reading drive <x>:

where <x> is the local target drive issued to the NCOPY command.

CAUSE
=====

According to the Microsoft Windows 3.1 NETWORKS.WRI file:

   Current versions of the NetWare shell are not fully compatible with SHARE.

Because Windows for Workgroups loads VSHARE.386 (the virtual SHARE device driver)
when in 386 enhanced mode, the NCOPY anomaly may manifest itself anytime Windows
for Workgroups is running in 386 enhanced mode, or is running in standard mode
with the MS-DOS SHARE utility loaded.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the Windows for Workgroups File Manager or the MS-DOS COPY or XCOPY command
instead of the NCOPY command. In Windows 95, use Windows Explorer, My Computer,
or the MS-DOS COPY or XCOPY command.
