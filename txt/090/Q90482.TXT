The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows for Workgroups allows files to be accessed by using a Universal Naming
Connection (UNC). When you access a file using this method, the Windows for
Workgroups password cache file is not used.

For example:

1. You connected to \\SERVER\SHARE, and provided a password. The password is
   stored in your password cache file.

2. You reconnect to \\SERVER\SHARE and the password is provided by the password
   cache file. You are not prompted to enter a password.

3. In the Microsoft Write File Open dialog box, you open the file README.TXT on
   that server by typing

   \\server\share\readme.txt

   where "server" is your server, and "share" is your share.

   This causes Windows for Workgroups to prompt you for a password even though it
   is in the password cache file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is caused by Windows use of MS-DOS file management. Due to the
nonreentrant nature of MS-DOS, Windows for Workgroups is unable to open the
password cache file because it is in the process of opening the file specified
in the UNC.
