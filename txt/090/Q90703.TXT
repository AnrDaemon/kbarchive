SUMMARY
=======

Dayna Communications' DL 2000 ISA Board allows a personal computer (PC) to
connect or print through an AppleTalk Network. DShare, an MS-DOS redirector
package, is a shareware product from Dayna Communications that can only be
obtained with the purchase of the board. Although DShare allows you to use the
board in MS-DOS, this program does not function properly in Microsoft Windows
and is not supported by Dayna for use in Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The AppleTalk Network is not supported in Windows version 3.0, 3.0a, or 3.1. To
use the AppleTalk Network with the DL 2000 ISA board in Windows, another
software product is required. One example is Farallon's PhoneNet Talk, which,
according to Dayna Communications, works with the board in Windows.

For more information about these products, contact Dayna Communications or
Farallon Computing.
