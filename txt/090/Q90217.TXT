SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Chat has a Define Custom Colors button in its
Background Color dialog box. The button is always dimmed (unavailable) because
Chat uses a standard Windows dialog for choosing the background color.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Depending on the type of display you have, some of the colors you can choose in
this dialog box will be shown by "dithering" (intermixing alternating pixels of
different colors) to approximate a color shade that cannot be shown as a solid
color. Chat can only use solid colors as text background; if the color chosen is
a dithered color, it will be mapped to the nearest solid color. Because most
systems support even fewer solid colors than appear in the color choice dialog,
creating custom colors was not considered a useful feature to provide.

To save resources, the dialog box is created with a style that always disables
the Create Custom Colors button.
