TITLE   :COMMAND.COM Corrupted or Missing on a DoubleSpace Drive
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using DoubleSpace and the COMMAND.COM file cannot be found, your
system is not bootable.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Start the system from MS-DOS 6.0 Setup Disk 1.

2. Exit Setup by pressing the F3 function key twice. The DoubleSpace drive
   should now be available.

3. Copy the DBLSPACE.BIN file to the root directory of drive C as follows:

      copy dblspace.bin c:\ 

4. Remove the setup disk from drive A and restart the computer.

MS-DOS Setup Disk 1 contains DBLSPACE.BIN. When you start MS-DOS from drive A and
the disk in drive A contains DBLSPACE.BIN, the DoubleSpace drive becomes
accessible as if you started the system from drive C.

Additional query words: 6.00 dblspace double space
