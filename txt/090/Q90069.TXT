The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

If you use a Microsoft Windows 3.0 printer driver that uses the GENLIB.DLL file,
general protection (GP) faults or Divide Overflow messages may occur in Windows
3.1 when you print from a Windows-based application.

The default number of copies for printing may intermittently change to as high as
several thousand.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the problem, delete the old GENLIB.DLL file and the corresponding
driver (.DRV) file and install a Windows 3.1 printer driver by using the Control
Panel, Printers option.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The GENLIB.DLL file was only included in the Supplemental Driver Library for
Windows 3.0 and was used with the following printers:
