TITLE   :WFWG May Not Remove All Existing Network Drivers

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a network driver is not listed in the NETWORK.INF file, Windows for
Workgroups Setup version 3.1 does not remove it from either the CONFIG.SYS or
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

CAUSE
=====

Windows for Workgroups Setup uses the [delete_netware] and [delete_drivers]
sections of the NETWORK.INF file to determine what files to delete when
installing new network drivers over existing network drivers.

If a driver has been renamed (for example, renamed IPX.COM to MYIPX.COM), or is
not listed (a special driver for uncommon network cards), Setup does not remove
the driver or its references from either the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT files.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove the driver and references by manually
editing the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT files.
