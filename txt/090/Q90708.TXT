SUMMARY
=======

Windows looks at file extensions and filenames when searching for and running
executable files specified on the command line accessed by choosing Run from the
File. This is slightly different than the method used by MS- DOS, and can affect
processing order.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MS-DOS command processor ignores filename extensions at first and looks in
itself for a string matching the command to be processed. If it finds none, it
looks in the current directory and then along the PATH for filenames matching
the issued command and having, in this order, the .COM, .EXE, or .BAT extension.
This is a search order only -- MS-DOS always executes .COM files before .EXE
files, regardless of any extension you specify on the command line. If, for
instance, it finds a MYPROG.COM and a MYPROG.EXE in the same place, MS-DOS
always runs MYPROG.COM first. However, the processor runs MYPROG.EXE before
MYPROG.COM if MYPROG.EXE is found first during the PATH search.

Windows behaves differently, using the executable file extension defined in the
Programs= line of WIN.INI. The typical listing order for executable extensions
is COM, EXE, BAT, and PIF. If you choose Run from the File menu in File Manager
or Program Manager, and enter the string MYPROG without an extension in the
command line, Windows executes MYPROG.COM before MYPROG.EXE. If you specify the
full name and extension in the command line, Windows uses the extension to
determine which file to load. While this also is true of MS-DOS, Windows allows
you to change the search order.

If you run only Windows executable files and do not specify an extension, you may
be able to boost system performance slightly by listing .EXE files before .COM
files.
