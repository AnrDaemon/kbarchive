TITLE   :LAN Manager Logon Scripts Cause System Integrity Violations
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive a system integrity violation error while running a Microsoft LAN
Manager logon script.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft LAN Manager logon scripts are batch files that are run by the LAN
Manager domain controller upon verification of user logon. This LAN Manager
feature is set up on the LAN Manager server.

Logon scripts can be enabled in Windows for Workgroups by installing LAN Manager
as a secondary network and setting the logon feature in Control Panel. When
Windows for Workgroups logs on and the user is verified by the LAN Manager
domain controller, the logon scripts are run automatically in an MS-DOS virtual
machine (VM). These scripts are given a maximum of 30 seconds to run before
Windows for Workgroups regains control and finishes loading. If the LAN Manager
logon script runs for more than 30 seconds, you receive the system integrity
violation error.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, either shorten the logon scripts or disable this
feature in Control Panel, or on the LAN Manager domain controller.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Usually LAN Manager logon scripts are used to reconnect network shares
automatically for the user. Because Windows for Workgroups has persistent net
connections, it is no loner necessary to use these scripts for that purpose and
it's better not to do so.

Sometimes logon scripts are used to run programs such as virus scanners or other
utilities from the server. In this case, you may want to create a batch file (or
edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file) that starts the Windows for Workgroups real-mode
redirector, connects to the server where the virus scanner exists, runs it, and
disconnects the share. For example:

      c:\windows\net start full
      net use v: \\server\share
      v:\virus\scan.exe
      net use v: /d
      c:\windows\net stop

To Disable Logon Scripts in Control Panel
-----------------------------------------

1. Run Control Panel and choose the Network icon.

2. Choose the Networks button.

3. Select Microsoft LAN Manager in the Other Networks In Use list box.

4. Choose the Settings button.

5. Clear the Log On To LAN Manager Domain check box.

See your LAN Manager administrator if you want to disable logon scripts on the
LAN Manager domain controller, although this is not necessary if you have
disabled it in Control Panel.
