SUMMARY
=======

When you share a printer with Windows for Workgroups, there is a hidden resource
associated with the shared printer; this resource is the directory where
temporary spool files are stored when clients print to the printer. Windows for
Workgroups uses the directory indicated by the TEMP environment variable.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you select the Reshare At Startup check box, making a print share persistent,
the current value of the TEMP environment variable is recorded along with the
share information in the SHARES.PWL file. If you subsequently change the value
of TEMP, the share still uses the old path. To start using a new path, you must
stop and restart the printer share.

Because you cannot share redirected devices, you get an error message if you
attempt to share a printer when its port has been redirected to a network
device. If you set your TEMP variable to a network drive, you get the same error
message. In this case, change the TEMP variable to refer to a local drive.
