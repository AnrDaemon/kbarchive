SYMPTOMS
========

When the COPY FILE command is used to copy a file, a "File access denied" error
occurs.

CAUSE
=====

The destination filename is not specified in the COPY FILE command.

RESOLUTION
==========

Specify the fully qualified pathname for the destination file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To copy the TEST.PRG file from the C:\FOXPRO2 directory to the C:\PROGRAM
directory, enter the following command in the Command window:

      COPY FILE C:\FOXPRO2\TEST.PRG TO C:\PROGRAM\TEST.PRG

Omitting the filename, as follows

      COPY FILE C:\FOXPRO2\TEST.PRG TO C:\PROGRAM

causes a "File access denied" error message to appear. FoxPro interprets the
PROGRAM directory as the name of a file and it is unable to open that directory
as a file.
