SUMMARY
=======

There are two known problems that can temporarily halt server operation in
Windows for Workgroups.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Print Manager Menus
-------------------

If you activate a menu in Print Manager on the server machine, all print jobs
temporarily stop spooling. Once the menu is closed, spooling resumes. No other
shared resources are affected.

Critical Errors in MS-DOS or Windows
------------------------------------

Critical errors on the server machine, those that cause the system to halt until
the error is resolved, stop all network communication. Critical errors in MS-DOS
Prompt sessions and in Windows usually result in the options Abort, Retry or
Fail. Once you respond to one of the options and the critical error has been
resolved, all network communication will resume.

If the server is also the browse-master for its workgroup, other users attempting
to browse will notice a long delay before a connection or network settings
dialog box appears.

The server automatically ignores critical errors that happen on remote clients,
and returns an appropriate error code to the client that encountered the error
(Fail).
