SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 does not work with Novell TCP/IP
product.

NOTE: This information does not apply to later versions of Windows for
Workgroups.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Novell's TCP/IP product is LAN Workplace for MS-DOS version 4.0. This product
has a TCP/IP transport driver that uses Novell's ODI
transport/media-access-control interfaces to send and receive messages using the
ODI LSL.

Windows for Workgroups uses the NDIS transport/media-access-control interfaces to
send and receive network messages. The ODI interfaces are not supported for
Windows for Workgroups; consequently, Novell's TCP/IP is not supported.
