TITLE   :Print Manager Continuously Ejects Separator Pages
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

On certain printer models when printing with Separator Pages enabled, the
Windows for Workgroups Print Manager may continuously print separator page(s)
after the first print job, then fail to print subsequent print jobs. The
printers known to be affected are:

   Canon LBP-4
   Canon LBP-8 II
   Canon LBP-8 III
   IBM Laser Printer 4019
   Okidata Docit 4000
   Olivetti DM 109
   Olivetti DM 309

CAUSE
=====

Printing separator pages on the above printers is currently unsupported with
Windows for Workgroups.

The Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Print Manager has the ability to print a
separator page between print jobs to allow you to easily identify your print
jobs in the printer's output bin (or equivalent). When sending multiple print
jobs to one of the above printers, the first print job may print, but then be
followed by the repeated printing of separator pages, without printing any
additional print jobs.

WORKAROUND
==========

The only known workaround at this time is use the above printers with no
separator page between print jobs.

To disable separator pages:

1. Start Print Manager.

2. From the Options menu, choose Separator Pages.

3. Select No Separator Page, then choose the OK button.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups versions
3.1 and 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
as it becomes available.
