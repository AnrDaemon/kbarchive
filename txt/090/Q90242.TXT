SUMMARY
=======

The memory loader invoked by NET START is aggressive when loading the memory
resident (TSR) portions of the program. If you optimize your memory using a
third-party memory manager such as Quarterdecks QEMM or Qualitas' 386 MAX, you
should mark any NET START commands as "non-optimizeable" and place them in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file so they are the last program to load.

This allows the memory manager to optimize to its full potential, and then allow
the NET START loader to fill up any remaining holes that it can find.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The NET START command loads the following services as memory resident

 - NetBEUI

 - STD

 - ENH

 - POPUP

when an XMS memory provider is present.

The manner in which it does this is more aggressive than most memory loaders; it
breaks the service into its component segments and attempts to find upper memory
block (UMB) space for them individually, thereby (usually) loading more of these
services into upper memory.
