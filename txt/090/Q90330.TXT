======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the same computer is operating as both the postoffice server and the browse
master for a workgroup, the system may appear to stop responding (hang) when
Workgroup Mail is active.

You may have to wait for as long as three to four minutes for the system to
return to your control.

CAUSE
=====

Windows for Workgroups dynamically elects a computer in a workgroup to act as
the browse master for a period of time. If this computer happens to be the same
computer that is acting as the postoffice server, performance may drop
significantly when Mail is active.

WORKAROUND
==========

If your computer is acting as the postoffice server and you are experiencing
severe performance problems, add the following line to the [Network] section of
the SYSTEM.INI file:

      MaintainServerList=no

This setting prevents your computer from ever becoming the browse master. Note
that this setting should only be used in extreme cases.
