======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Sound System, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If the following error message is displayed, a disk other than disk 1 of the
Windows Sound System may be in the floppy drive:

   Cannot find the file SETUP.INF

If this is the case, replace the disk with disk 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows Sound System Setup will ask to restart Windows in order to activate the
sound driver. Before Setup allows you to exit Windows, it puts a Windows Sound
System Setup icon in the Startup group. Once Windows is restarted, the Setup
program looks for the SETUP.INF file from disk 1. If another disk is in the
drive, it will display the above error message.

To resolve the problem, insert disk 1 into the disk drive and choose the Retry
button. Setup should then find the SETUP.INF file and continue with the Windows
Sound Systems installation.
