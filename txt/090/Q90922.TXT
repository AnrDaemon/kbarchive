TITLE   :Net Watcher Requires Enhanced Mode in Windows for Workgroups
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If Net Watcher is loaded on a workstation running Windows for Workgroups in
standard mode, the following error message appears:

   Net Watcher requires VSERVER.386 in order to run. Make sure that you are
   running Windows in 386 enhanced mode and that sharing is enabled in the
   Control Panel Network option.

CAUSE
=====

The Net Watcher utility (NETWATCH.EXE) may be started while running Windows for
Workgroups in standard mode, even though it is designed for enhanced mode. In
standard mode, Net Watcher may exhibit unexpected behavior or cause the
workstation to exhibit unexpected behavior.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups version
3.1. This problem does not occur in later versions of the product.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Net Watcher utility is provided with Windows for Workgroups to monitor the
properties and activities of active connections to a Windows for Workgroups
server. Because a Windows for Workgroups machine must be running in enhanced
mode to be a server, Net Watcher was only intended to be run in enhanced mode.

However, if you ignore the error message and choose the OK button, and Net
Watcher is loaded, it may produce erroneous information (extended characters in
non-existent machine names, and so on) about connections to the machine.
