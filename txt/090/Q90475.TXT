SUMMARY
=======

PING.EXE is a utility provided with Microsoft LAN Manager 2.1 TCP/IP support.
This utility does not function properly under Windows for Workgroups.

PING.EXE attempts to spawn NMTSR.EXE out of the LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTOCOL\TCPIP
directory when PING.EXE is initially run. To use PING.EXE, you must have the
TCP/IP protocol installed in Windows for Workgroups, and you must manually load
NMTSR.EXE before using PING.EXE.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PING.EXE is a TCP/IP utility with the Microsoft LAN Manager 2.1 and Windows NT
products that allows you to see if another machine is active on the network. By
providing PING.EXE with a specific network address, you can test to see if
another machine is responding to network broadcasts.

To manually load NMTSR.EXE to be visible in all virtual machines when running
Windows, start NMTSR.EXE in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file or at the MS-DOS command
prompt before starting Windows by typing:

   c:\lanman.dos\drivers\protocol\tcpip\nmtsr.exe

Additional query words: 3.10 VM 3.11
