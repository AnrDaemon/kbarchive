SUMMARY
=======

In some instances, Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 Setup may install certain
network files to the root directory of a startup drive. This article explains
why.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Windows for Workgroups (Windows 3.1 running on a network), the personal
WINDOWS directory contains all files with .INI, .GRP, and .PIF extensions, as
well as REG.DAT, WIN.COM, WINVER.EXE, and any MS-DOS device drivers. The
personal WINDOWS directory may also contain the MS-DOS network device drivers
and the NET.EXE, MSIPX.COM, and NETX.COM files. (These files may also be copied
to the root directory of a startup drive.) The shared WINDOWS directory contains
all other Windows files.

The NETWORK.INF file uses the keywords "windir," "sysdir," "netdir," and "devdir"
to classify the different Windows files. These files are placed in the WINDOWS
directory, SYSTEM directory or root directory of the startup drive, depending on
the type of installation you perform.

Real-mode network device drivers are classified as devdir files. These include
PROTMAN.DOS, PROTOCOL.INI, and WORKGRP.SYS. The device drivers in this directory
must be correctly referenced in the CONFIG.SYS file.

Real-mode network utilities and terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs are
classified as netdir files. These include NET.EXE, MSIPX.COM, NETX.COM, and
ROUTE.COM. These utilities and TSRs must be correctly referenced in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

The following table illustrates how Setup determines where to place the files
classified as Netdir and Devdir.
