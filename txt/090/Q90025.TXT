SUMMARY
=======

Once the Windows Sound System is installed, the only way to uninstall it is to
follow the instructions in the DEINSTAL.TXT file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows Sound System installs the bulk of its files into C:\SNDSYS by default.
In addition, files are copied to the \WINDOWS directory, the WINDOWS\SYSTEM
directory, the EXCEL\LIBRARY directory, and the Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows
directory (depending on the options that you select during Setup). Some existing
.INI files such as WIN.INI, SYSTEM.INI, and CONTROL.INI are also modified in the
Windows 3.1 directory.

Windows Sound System installs a text file called DEINSTAL.TXT, located in the
\SNDSYS directory. This file contains step-by-step instructions to remove all
traces of Windows Sound System from your computer, including restoring your
pre-Windows Sound System .INI files.

Windows Sound System Setup creates a backup copy of all .INI files that it
modifies in the Windows 3.1 directory with .WSS extensions. You can restore the
pre-Windows Sound System configuration by restoring these .INI files. This
restoration works if you have not made any changes to your system after
installing Windows Sound System. If you have made other changes or installed new
software, restoring the .INI files causes the changes to be lost.

If you have run Windows Sound System Setup more than once, then restoring the
.INI files will not work correctly. The DEINSTAL.TXT file describes the exact
changes made to each of the .INI files so you manually remove those changes.
