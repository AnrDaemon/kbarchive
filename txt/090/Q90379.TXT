SYMPTOMS
========

If you are running Novell NetWare with Microsoft Windows version 3.1 and change
the Novell network version in the Windows Setup program, the Windows Setup
program will replace any programs listed on the Load= line of the WIN.INI file
with NWPOPUP.EXE. The old entries on the Load= line will be lost unless you have
made a backup of your WIN.INI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you change network drivers, Setup reads the SETUP.INF file to determine
which .INI file lines need to be updated. However, as outlined on page 104 of
the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" version 3.1, there is no syntax in the
SETUP.INF for adding values to existing .INI file entries; it only replaces
existing values. Hence, the old entries on the Load= line are removed, and the
new line is rewritten to display only NWPOPUP. This problem does not occur with
other networks such as Microsoft LAN Manager because they rely on the network
drivers themselves to add network pop-up utilities on the Load= line rather than
relying on the Windows Setup program for these updates.

The Novell products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
