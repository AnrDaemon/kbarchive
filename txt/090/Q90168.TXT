The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft WinLogin, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the WinLogin Configuration Manager, it is possible to add files to the
listings of the Users, Groups, Workstations, and Administrators. WinLogin allows
multiple instances of the same filename to be added. This does not mean that
there are multiple instances of the file present.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in WinLogin version 1.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.
