TITLE   :PRB: _MSSETUP.EXE Disappears
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

_MSSETUP.EXE disappears from the default directory; in fact, it deletes itself.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. _MSSETUP.EXE is invoked when the MSSetup script file calls
ExitExecRestart(). This function exits Windows and calls _MSSETUP.EXE to read
any commands that have been placed in _MSSETUP.BAT. (Commands are placed in
_MSSETUP.BAT when a file in the copy list is specified as a system file that is
in use during the Windows portion of the MSSetup program.) As part of the
cleanup before returning to Windows, _MSSETUP.EXE deletes itself.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you run _MSSETUP.EXE from the MS-DOS command line or from the File Manager,
it looks for _MSSETUP.BAT, does not find it, and then deletes itself. One way to
workaround this is to compress _MSSETUP.EXE so that it cannot be executed on its
own.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: The Setup Toolkit places commands in the _MSSETUP.BAT file to copy files
that are in use during the execution of the Windows portion of the Setup
program. These files are specified in MSSetup's file copy list. For example, if
a copy list includes an update to the SHELL.DLL file, Setup cannot update the
SHELL file while Windows is running.
