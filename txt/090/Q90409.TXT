======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for MS-DOS, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To use a Microsoft Mouse in FoxBASE+ running FoxBASE Central, create a batch
file that performs the following tasks:

 - Load the MS-DOS mouse driver and specify the desired mouse sensitivity (the
   mouse is very sensitive in FoxBASE+)

 - Load the default mouse menus provided with FoxBASE+

 - Load FoxBASE+

MORE INFORMATION
================

The text below details the steps to use a mouse with FoxBASE Central:

1. At the MS-DOS prompt, enter the following commands to create a START.BAT
   batch file in the C:\FOXBASE directory:

   " CD C:\FOXBASE
   COPY CON START.BAT
   MOUSE 4/s40
   DEFAULT
   FOXPLUS
   ^Z " (without the quotation marks)

   The file must load the default mouse menus immediately prior to loading
   FoxBASE+. (If the you exit FoxBASE+, you must reload the mouse menus before
   restarting FoxBASE+.)

2. Run the START batch file from the C:\FOXBASE directory, as follows:

   " CD C:\FOXBASE
   START " (without the quotation marks)

3. In FoxBASE+, start FoxBASE Central by entering the following command:

   " CENTRAL " (without the quotation marks)

FoxBASE+ does not have a mouse pointer. Moving the mouse moves the keyboard
cursor. At the dot prompt, any mouse movement other than horizontal movement
causes an error beep. In FoxBASE Central, the highlight bar moves as the mouse
is moved. Pressing the right mouse button is equivalent to pressing ENTER.
Pressing the left mouse button issues the LIST command.
