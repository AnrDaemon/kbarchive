The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows for Workgroups Setup stops responding (hangs) immediately after
displaying the initial blue screen if you are using a Cabletron E2000 series
network adapter and the I/O address is anything other than 300.

This problem occurs when Setup attempts to perform network card detection. To
work around this problem, run Setup /I to ignore hardware detection.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups version
3.1. We are researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.

Additional query words: 3.10 hang hung stop stops stopped freeze frozen 3rdparty
