The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Workgroup Connections, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you use the Windows for Workgroups or Workgroup Connections pop-up
terminate and stay resident (TSR) program (started with the NET START POPUP
command) while an MS-DOS-based application is printing to a redirected port
(a print server), the print job may be halted. When you clear the pop-up
dialog box, the print job resumes, often becoming garbled as the printer
misinterprets the rest of the print job.

Additional query words: 1.00 3.10 popup wc line lines box boxes junk garbage incomplete poor output corrupt character characters hang crash stop inconsistent freeze
