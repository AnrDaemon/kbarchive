When connecting to a network drive in Windows for Workgroups File
Manager, you cannot assign a local drive letter as a network drive.
You can only assign a network drive to a drive letter after your last
hard disk.

However, this can be done by executing an MS-DOS command prompt
through Windows, then connecting and assigning the drive using
MS-DOS-level network connection utilities.
