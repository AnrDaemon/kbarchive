======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a Status Message Query against the local site, an error occurs. If
you use the query tool to run the same query, an error appears that indicates
that the tempdb database is full.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - For clients that are running Microsoft SQL Server 6.5, you must manually
   Expand the size of Tempdb.

 - For clients that are running SQL Server 7.0, verify that Automatically grow
   file is enabled in the tempdb File Properties, and that Unrestricted
   filegrowth is enabled for Maximum File Size.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
