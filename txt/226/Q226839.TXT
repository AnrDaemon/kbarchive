TITLE   :SMS: Win 3.x Computers Can't Run Hardware Inventory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbInventory

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Windows 3.x computers may not run hardware inventory if the computer
has less than 350 kilobytes (KB) of conventional memory.

CAUSE
=====

Hardware inventory uses WinExec() to start the program information file (PIF),
which in turn starts Invdos.exe. One of the parameters in the Invdos.exe file is
the memory requirement. This parameter is set to 350 KB, which is the size of
Invdos.exe plus the size of largest .exe file that Invdos.exe loads and runs,
and an additional 50 KB for buffer and allocations.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, adjust the limit by using Pifedit.exe on a 16-bit
computer, load Invds932.pif, and then replace the 350-KB limit parameter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This information also applies to the Japanese version of Windows 3.x clients.

When hardware inventory starts the PIF, Windows takes over and, as part of the
command box creation process, checks for available MS-DOS memory (low memory).
If there is insufficient MS-DOS memory (as opposed to Windows virtual memory),
Windows produces a "INVDS932" message that there is not enough memory.
