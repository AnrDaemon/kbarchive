TITLE   :SMS: Client Packages Are Not Re-advertised
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An advertised package that is uninstalled on a client computer is not
re-advertised.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Systems Management Server checks the
Winnt\MS\SMS\Clicomp\Apa\Data\Complete folder to see which advertised packages
have been installed on the client. If a package appears as complete, it will not
be re-advertised to the client.

WORKAROUND
==========

The following are alternative methods you can use to readvertise a specific
program to a client or collection:

 - Delete the corresponding package that is located in the
   Winnt\MS\SMS\Clicomp\Apa\Data\Complete folder. CAUTION: This will remove all
   installation history.

 - Send a new advertisement. This must occur using a new program ID. The new
   program can launch the same .exe file, but it must be a unique program with
   its own ID.

 - Set up the advertisement for a recurring job. CAUTION: If the original
   advertisement was set to run "ASAP", this will not work. If the advertisement
   was initially set to run under a schedule that is forward in time to begin
   with, this will work as desired.
