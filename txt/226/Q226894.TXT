TITLE   :SMS: SMS_LOCAL_DIR Must Not Exceed the Maximum of 8 Characters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0,2.0 SP1,2.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0, if the environment variable
SMS_LOCAL_DIR is modified to include a directory with more than eight
characters, SMS truncates the directory name and creates a new directory for
client installation.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the directory name must conform to the 8.3
MS-DOS restriction; that is, MS-DOS programs (like SMSBOOT1) cannot handle file
or directory names of more than eight characters.

WORKAROUND
==========

Before installing the client software and setting SMS_LOCAL_DIR, follow these
steps:

1. Manually create a directory, (for example, SMSINSTALLATION).

2. Set SMS_LOCAL_DIR to the directory short name (SMSINS~1).

SMS installs into the existing SMSINSTALLATION directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 2.0.
