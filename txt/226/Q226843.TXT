TITLE   :SMS: Setup Doesn't Fail As Expected in Unsupported Installation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The installation of a Primary site on a server hosting a database and SQL
providers from another site is not a supported configuration. However, when you
install a Primary site (with local SQL only) on a computer that is a remote SQL
server for another Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) site, Setup allows
you to proceed with the installation. Because this is not a supported
configuration, Setup should gracefully fail during both Express Setup and Custom
Setup.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If SMS and SQL are installed on separate computers, Setup prompts you to select
a location in which to install the SMS provider. For performance reasons,
consider installing the SMS provider on the same server as the SQL Server
computers (the default). After all these options have been configured, Setup
begins copying files, registering DLLs and COM objects, and performing
installation tasks.
