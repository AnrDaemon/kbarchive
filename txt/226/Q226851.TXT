======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When multiple changes are made to a Systems Management Server (SMS) site server
immediately (within a minute or two) after the site is installed, the changes
for software metering and other components may not be written to the site
control file and, therefore, the changes are not implemented on the clients.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the site server installation has not yet
stabilized.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, perform a site reset.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
