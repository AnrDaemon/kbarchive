TITLE   :SMS: Remote Control of Client in MS-DOS Full Screen Mode Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbHelpDesk

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to run a remote control session with a client that has the MS-DOS
window open in full screen, the attempt may be unsuccessful. In some cases, the
remote control window closes. In other cases, the remote control window stops
responding (hangs) and remains dimmed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, do not use full-screen MS-DOS mode on the client
during a remote control session.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post more information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base when it becomes available.
