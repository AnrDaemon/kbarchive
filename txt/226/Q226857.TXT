TITLE   :SMS: Intersite License Balancing Still Runs After Being Disabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsmsMeter

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When intersite license balancing is enabled for your software metering servers
and then, at a later time, disabled, intersite license balancing continues
according to its configured schedule.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because after intersite license balancing is enabled at the
site, it cannot be turned off.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, increase the interval at which licenses are balanced
so that this traffic occurs as infrequently as possible.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
