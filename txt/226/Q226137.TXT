SUMMARY
=======

This article explains the two Performance Monitor counters for MSExchangeIS:
Push Notifications Generated/sec and Push Notifications Skipped/sec.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Push Notifications Generated/sec counter is the number of Push Notifications
generated every second by the Exchange Server information store to send to
clients so they will update themselves with the latest messages sent to them.

The Push Notifications Skipped/sec counter is the number of notifications that
are skipped (not sent to the client). The reason these notifications are not
sent to the client is because the Exchange Server information store queues push
notifications for a short period of time, and it sees that several notifications
are queued to go to the same client. So, instead of flooding the client with
multiple notifications, the information store skips all but one of the
notifications, and sends the single notification to the client.

These two counters should never be equal, but the Push Notifications Skipped/sec
can be a high percentage of the Push Notifications Generated/sec on a healthy
Exchange Server.
