SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how Systems Management Server 2.0 establishes a
connection with a client computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you attempt to establish a remote tools session with a Systems Management
Server client computer, the Systems Management Server Administrator console uses
a specific order to establish the session. The following list outlines this
order:

1. The Systems Management Server Administrator console uses the name of the
   client stored in the site database. This method is dependant on network-level
   name resolution.

2. The Systems Management Server Administrator console uses all IP and IPX
   addresses for the resource from the site database.

3. The Systems Management Server Administrator console connects using the
   NetBIOS base's LANA numbers.

The Systems Management Server Administrator console attempts name resolution
first to account for clients who have recently been assigned a new IP address.
The time delay to update the routers and name servers in your environment is
dependant upon your network topology and configuration. The next client
discovery cycle updates the IP, IPX, and NetBIOS names and addresses
automatically in the Systems Management Server database.
