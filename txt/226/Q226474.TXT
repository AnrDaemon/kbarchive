SYMPTOMS
========

When you use relative paths in include statements with Microsoft's Active Server
Pages (ASP), browsing a Web page may return an error message similar to the
following:

   Active Server Pages, ASP 0131
   Disallowed Parent Path
   The Include file '../<filename.ext>' cannot contain '..' to indicate the
   parent directory.
   /<path>/<filename.ext>, line <number>

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by disabling ASP's "parent paths" for a Web site or application
while using relative parent paths in an include statement.

Relative parent paths in include statements use the following form:

   

   <!--#include file="../<filename.ext>"-->


RESOLUTION
==========

The best solution to the problem is to use absolute virtual paths from the root
of the Web site instead of relative paths.

For example, if you use an include file named "foo.inc" at the root of your
server, the virtual path would be "/foo.inc." If you use the same include file
in a virtual directory named "/includes" on your server, the virtual path would
be "/includes/foo.inc."

The syntax example below illustrates how to implement virtual paths:

   

   <!--#include virtual="/<virtual path>/<filename.ext>"-->


An alternative to using absolute virtual paths is to enable parent paths;
however, this is not the preferred method. (See the notes in the More
Information section for details.) This is accomplished for your default Web site
by using the following steps:

1. Open the Internet Services Manager in the Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

2. Right-click on your Default Web Site and select Properties.

3. Click the Home Directory tab.

4. Click the Configuration button.

5. Click the App Options tab.

6. Click to select the Enable Parent Paths checkbox.

7. Click the OK button until you return to the MMC.

: There are additional security considerations to be considered when enabling
parent paths on an IIS computer. For more information, please see the following
