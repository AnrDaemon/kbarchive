======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you want to increase the number of available licenses for a particular
product that is being metered by software metering, one option is to import a
license Management Information Format (MIF) file, which contains the additional
license information. When you do this, the number of licenses is not increased
in an additive fashion but, rather, is overwritten by the new value contained in
the MIF file.

CAUSE
=====

When an MIF file is imported for a program that already exists, and the MIF file
contains identical parameters as a program that is already being metered, the
existing parameters are overwritten.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, make sure that any import MIF files reflect the total
available licenses rather than the number of licenses to be added.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
