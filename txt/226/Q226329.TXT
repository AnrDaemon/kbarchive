TITLE   :XFOR: Connector for Lotus Notes Access Violation in Lsmexout
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running the Exchange Notes Connector for Lotus Notes, the Lsmexout
process may stop. When this occurs, you receive an access violation error
message. This behavior occurs if the Connector program tries to export a message
from Microsoft Exchange Server to Lotus Notes, and the e-mail address of one of
the message recipients is more than 383 characters in length. Usually, a message
recipient is not this large, but may be because of some other previous
processing failure that is possibly outside the scope of Microsoft Exchange
Server.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because additional checks have been added to determine the
length of a message recipient's e-mail address before attempting to convert it.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.
