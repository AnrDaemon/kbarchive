TITLE   :Desktop Icons Are Rearranged After You Install Windows NT SP4
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0,4.0 SP4,4.0 SP5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) on your computer, all
desktop icons are arranged in alphabetical order on the left side of the screen,
regardless of their previous location.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because SP4 enables the desktop icon Auto Arrange feature.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

1. Right-click an empty area of the desktop.

2. Point to Arrange Icons, and then click Auto Arrange to clear the check mark.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Following is the registry key and value:

Registry key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Current
Version\Explorer\Deskview

Value: 01 00 00 00 20 02 00 00

When the fifth set of hexadecimal numbers is set to 21, Auto Arrange is on. When
it is 20, Auto Arrange is off. However, this setting cannot be enforced. If the
user changes the desktop so that it does not have Auto Arrange, this setting
does not stay at logoff. When the system policy or logoff script runs upon the
next login, the Auto Arrange setting is set for the desktop.
