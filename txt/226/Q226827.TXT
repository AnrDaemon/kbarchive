TITLE   :SMS: Offline Software Metering Server May Affect Client Behavior
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You experience an abnormal number of product denials when one or more of your
software metering servers is unavailable on the network for a brief period of
time. You may also notice an imbalance of licenses on your site if software
metering servers remain unavailable during a license balancing cycle. You may
also notice a performance degradation on the client computer when no software
metering server is available.

CAUSE
=====

The software metering client attempts to communicate with its current server,
but the communication fails. Instead of retrying the connection for the number
of times configured on your site server, the client immediately looks for
another available software metering server. Product denials may result, until
the next license balancing cycle. When the software metering server that the
client could not reach again becomes available, a license imbalance occurs.

Further, if a client is unable to communicate with any software metering server,
it continues trying until a software metering server responds.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
