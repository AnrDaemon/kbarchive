KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to perform an express installation of a primary site and in doing
so remove the Microsoft SMS Service account, and you then try to reset the
installation, installation is not successful and you receive the following error
message:

   Cannot Install SMS Site Manager.

CAUSE
=====

If the SMS Service account is removed, resetting the installation does not
install SMS Site Component Manager.

Site reset is not responsible for re-creating the service accounts. It can be
used only to reset the service account password or change the service account
name.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, you need to re-create the SMSService account. To do
so, follow these steps:

1. Delete the existing service account, and then run SMS Setup.

2. Select "Modify or reset the current installation", and then change the
   service account name.

3. Complete the SMS Setup.

The SMSService account is successfully re-created.
