SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0, after a child site attaches to
its parent, the number of status messages reported by the parent site is
inconsistent with the number reported by the child site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a child site connects to a parent site, the status summarizers forward a
copy of their status summaries to the parent site. Also, some of the other data
in the database, such as inventory and discovery records, are sent up to the
parent site so that the parent site has duplicate copies of all the child site's
data. Unlike inventory and discovery data, no status messages are sent to the
parent site. After the attachment has been made, only new status messages are
replicated to the parent. This behavior is by design.
