OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsmsMeter

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Within the Software Metering tool:

1. Resource manager imports group names with lowercase extended characters if
   the import is completed shortly after site installation.

2. Group permissions do not function when the accounts are in the system with
   lowercase extended characters.



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you should take these precautions:

 - Enter groups manually, all converted to uppercase.

 - Wait 4 hours before importing resources.

 - Create custom groups with all uppercase names, no extended characters in each
   domain.

 - Do not create the same group name in any two domains.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
