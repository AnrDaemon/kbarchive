======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following message may appear in the Systems Management Server 2.0 Status
Message system every few minutes:

+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Component                  | Status message text          | Message ID |

In addition, if logging for SMS_Discovery_Data_Manager is enabled, the following
message appears in the DDM.log file:

   CDiscoverDataManager::GetSiteInfo - Could not get subsites.
   STATMSG: ID=679 SEV=E LEV=M SOURCE="SMS Server"
   COMP="SMS_DISCOVERY_DATA_MANAGER" SYS=SERVERXXX SITE=XXX PID=314 TID=519
   GMTDATE=Tue Mar 23 15:38:31.973 1999 ISTR0="" ISTR1="" ISTR2="" ISTR3=""
   ISTR4="" ISTR5="" ISTR6="" ISTR7="" ISTR8="" ISTR9="" NUMATTRS=0
   CDiscoverDataManager::Process - Could not refresh registry values.
   Sleeping for 60 seconds

No Discovery data records (DDRs) are processed.

CAUSE
=====

The SMS Service account listed in the SMSDATA table in the SMS database does not
match the service account the SMS_EXECUTIVE service is started with. To verify
you are experiencing this problem:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Services, and check the SMS_EXECUTIVE Startup
   properties.

2. Note the exact account name listed in the "Log on as" section.

3. Connect to the SMS database with the SQL query tool.

4. Perform the following query:

   Select ServiceAccountName from SMSDATA

5. Note the value returned from the query. If the name in the database and the
   name in Service Control Manager do not match exactly (letter for letter), you
   experience this problem.

WORKAROUND
==========

Perform a site reset and specify the SMS Service account again. Specify the SMS
Service account using the following format:

   <DOMAINNAME>\<SERVICEACCOUNTNAME>

For example,

   MYDOM1\smsservice

NOTE: It may take several minutes after the site reset is finished before the
information is actually updated.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When an SMS component connects to SQL, SMS checks to determine whether the
connection is being made by the SMS Service account or not. If it is not the SMS
Service account, SMS checks permissions and excludes results based on the user's
permissions. In this case, SMS_Discovery_Data_Manager is logged on as an account
name that does not match the ServiceAccountName entry in the SMSDATA table in
the SMS database. As a result, the query to find all sites returns no rows,
causing the error message listed above.
