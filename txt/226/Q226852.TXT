TITLE   :SMS: Parent Site Collections Locked at Detached Child Site
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbCollections

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After a child site is detached from its parent, you may notice collections from
the parent site still showing in the Administrator Console for the child site.
These collections are locked and cannot be modified.

CAUSE
=====

This situation occurs if the SMS_SQL_MONITOR (Smsdbmon.Exe) service experiences
problems during the detachment process. If SMS_SQL_MONITOR fails, the
SMS_COLLECTION_EVALUATOR service is not notified that the child site has been
detached from the parent site, and it does not unlock parent site collections.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, create a <Site_code>.sha file in the
Colleval.box directory at the child site.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
