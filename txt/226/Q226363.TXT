SYMPTOMS
========

When you set up logging for Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 using the
HTMLA Web Administration Forms, the value for "When Max File Size Reaches ..."
may be incorrectly formatted. This should only effect the following languages:

   German
   Japanese
   Arabic
   Russian

The default value for the maximum file size is 19.53125 MB. These languages are
normally formatted as follows:

   German: 19,53 (comma as decimal symbol, 2 digits after decimal) (currently
   displays 5 decimal places, not 2)

   Japanese: 19.53 (period as decimal symbol, 2 digits after decimal) (currently
   displays 5 decimal places, not 2)

   Arabic: 19.53 (period as decimal symbol, 2 digits after decimal) (currently
   19,53125)

   Hindi: 19.53 (period as decimal symbol, 2 digits after decimal) (currently
   displays 5 decimal places, not 2)

   Russian: 19,53 (comma as decimal symbol, 2 digits after decimal) (currently
   displays 5 decimal places, not 2)

STATUS

5.0.
