KEYWORDS:kbsms kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you receive a callback on a product that was initially denied, you are
presented with another denial message on the software metering client.


WORKAROUND
==========

This behavior is related to the number of times the license metering service has
been run on the site server. This problem will no longer occur following a site
server cycle (15 minutes) after the initial denial message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
