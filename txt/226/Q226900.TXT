SUMMARY
=======

Some organizations choose to modify the Microsoft Systems Management Server
software distribution model to lessen the load on their respective wide area
networks (WANs). SMS 2.0 includes the courier sender feature to allow package
distribution without taxing the WAN. When the courier sender is used, an
administrator creates an SMS package by selecting "This package contains source
files" on the Data Source tab of the package properties. The package is created
using the procedures outlined in SMS, except that the Source Directory box on
the Data Source tab of package properties contains only a small subset of the
files required to install the package. The administrator allows the distribution
process to create distribution points on distribution servers, and to create and
distribute package instruction files. When the package is successfully
distributed throughout the organization's WAN, a compact disc image is used to
manually copy the rest of the source files to distribution points on the WAN.

This modified distribution model eliminates much of the network usage that
otherwise results from having SMS distribute the package.

The key is to allow SMS software distribution mechanisms to create distribution
point shares and package instruction files. Package instruction files contain
information regarding the distribution servers that the package can be found on,
and are read by the Advertised Programs Monitor on client systems. SMS does not
require that all package source files be found and distributed from the package
Data Source directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If this method of software distribution is used, it is important that the
"Update distribution points on a schedule" option is not selected on the Data
Source tab for the package properties.
