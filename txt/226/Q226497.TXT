TITLE   :Static Mappings Not Replaced if Migrate ON/OFF Enabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) database on a WINS server contains a
unique static mapping for the WINS server's own name and you enable the Migrate
ON/OFF switch in the server's configuration, the server is not permitted to
overwrite static mapping for its name with dynamic name registration.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, manually delete the static mapping using one of the
following methods:

 - Delete any mappings in the Mappings/Static Mappings dialog box in WINS
   Manager.

 - Run Winscl.exe from the Windows NT resource kit to delete any mappings. For
   additional information about Winscl.exe, please see the following article in
   the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q137582 Using Winscl.exe

 - If your WINS server is running Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4)
   or later, you can use the Delete Record feature in the Mappings/Show Database
   dialog box to delete the record.

After you delete the static mapping, restart the WINS server to register its
names. If SP4 is installed, you can use the NBTSTAT -RR command on the WINS
server to re-register it.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0.
