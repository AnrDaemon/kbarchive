TITLE   :SMS: Cannot License Programs That Specify ANY for Language/Time
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a program is licensed and ANY is specified in either the time zone or
language categories, the record becomes mutually exclusive. This means that any
other instance of the same product cannot be tracked for another time zone or
language.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, explicitly enter each combination of time zone and
language.

For example:

+-------------------------------------------+
| Program  | Version | Language | Time Zone | 
+-------------------------------------------+
| Calc.exe | 4.00    | English  | Eastern   | 
+-------------------------------------------+
| Calc.exe | 4.00    | German   | Pacific   | 
+-------------------------------------------+
| Calc.exe | 4.00    | German   | Eastern   | 
+-------------------------------------------+
|          |         |          |           | 
+-------------------------------------------+
|          |         |          |           | 
+-------------------------------------------+

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
