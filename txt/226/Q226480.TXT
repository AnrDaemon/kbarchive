PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtool kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install a Windows NT Server, Terminal Server Edition-based computer on
a domain where the primary domain controller is running File and Printer Sharing
for NetWare, the Terminal Server profile path in User Manager may appear to
change to Windows NT Profile.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because of a problem in User Manager.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, you can safely ignore this behavior because the
Windows NT Profile path remains the Terminal Server profile path.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version Terminal
Server Edition for 4.00.

NOTE: It should be noted that if FPNW is removed, the behavior may still exist.

Additional query words: 4.00
