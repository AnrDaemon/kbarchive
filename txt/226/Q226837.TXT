TITLE   :SMS: Crystal Reports Location Is Displayed Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to the local Microsoft Systems Management Server site database
in the Systems Management Server Administrator console, disconnect, establish a
connection to a remote site database, and then connect again to the local site
server database and view the properties for Crystal Reports in the Tools folder
of the local site server, the reports appear to be installed on the remote site
server.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, close and then re-open the SMS Administrator
console.

Additionally, if you connect to only one site at a time when you use the Systems
Management Server Administrator console, this behavior does not occur.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server 2.0.
