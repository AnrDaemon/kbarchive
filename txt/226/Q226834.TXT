TITLE   :SMS: Cancel Button in Remote Restart Dialog Box Doesn't Work
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a remote tools session to restart a remote client, a dialog box
briefly appears informing you that the client is restarting. A Cancel button
appears at the bottom of the dialog box, giving the impression that the restart
can be cancelled. The length of time that the Cancel button is displayed varies
depending on the client's operating system. In any case, clicking the Cancel
button does not cancel the restart.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you restart a computer remotely, you receive two dialog boxes. The first
contains a prompt, which asks if you are sure that you want to restart the
client; the second indicates that the computer is restarting and it contains a
Cancel button. In fact, the restart cannot be cancelled at this point.
