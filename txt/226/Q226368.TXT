PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms120 kbsms120bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your path contains network drives, the Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) may
search those network drives for network DLLs. This may lead to increased network
traffic. To work around this problem, remove network drives from the path.

CAUSE
=====

NAL uses the Win32 API LoadLibrary() to load network DLLs. NAL calls
LoadLibrary() without specifying a path for the network DLLs. LoadLibrary()
searches for the network DLLs in the following sequence:

1. The directory from which the application loaded.

2. The current directory.

3. Windows 95/98: The Windows System directory. Use the GetSystemDirectory
   function to get the path of this directory.

   Windows NT/2000: The 32-bit Windows system directory. Use the
   GetSystemDirectory function to get the path of this directory. The name of
   this directory is System32.

4. Windows NT/2000: The 16-bit Windows system directory. There is no function
   that obtains the path of this directory, but it is searched. The name of this
   directory is System.

5. The Windows directory. Use the GetWindowsDirectory function to get the path
   of this directory.

6. The directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
