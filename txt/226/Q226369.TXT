TITLE   :Windows NT Does Not Detect Media Change on ATAPI PD CD-ROM
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Windows NT does not detect a change in media when a FAT-formatted PD
is removed from the drive. Even if another disk is inserted, both Windows NT
Explorer and the DIR command will continue to display the list of files from the
first FAT-formatted disk.

If the first PD disk present is formatted with the NTFS file system, Windows NT
will correctly detect the change in media when the first disk is removed. Only
FAT-formatted media display this problem.

After the FAT-formatted media has been inserted and replaced, the only way
Windows NT can display the correct media contents is if the media is reformatted
or the system is restarted.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Atapi.sys driver, which is responsible for this
device, does not handle media change detection on this hardware correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========
