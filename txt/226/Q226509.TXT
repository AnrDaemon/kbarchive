SYMPTOMS
========

After you save the Event Viewer log file and modify the registry to use the
saved event log file in a different location, an Access Violation error message
may be displayed in the System log.

CAUSE
=====

The Event Viewer tool can only write information to an event log file that is 64
KB in size (or any multiple of 64 KB). The Event Viewer Save As command does not
save the Event log file in 64 KB increments.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

STATUS

first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.
