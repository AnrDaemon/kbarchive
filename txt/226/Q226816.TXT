TITLE   :SMS: Installation Issues in Foreign Language Environments
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft Systems Management Server 2.0 using a site where one
of the following character sets is used

    - Finnish

 - Swedish

 - Estonian

 - Turkish

 - Lithuanian

Systems Management Server behaves abnormally and seems to have difficulty
uniquely identifying individual client computers.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Microsoft SQL Server data store for Systems
Management Server is configured to use a sort order that does not differentiate
between characters which, in one or more of the languages listed in the
"Symptoms" section, are considered the same character. The following list
describes some of these situations:

 - The letter "w" is equivalent to "v" in Estonian, Finnish, and Swedish.

 - The letter "y" is equivalent to "i" in Lithuanian.

 - The lowercase letter "i" is not equivalent to the uppercase "I" in Turkish.

These differences may become an issue when two characters, such as V and W --
which are different in character weight in English but are equivalent in
character weight in Swedish and Finnish -- are used to compose Systems
Management Server *unique* ID fields.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, configure your SQL Server data store for Systems
Management Server to use a sort order that is "aware" of these
character-set-specific differences. For example, the sort order "Swedish/Finnish
(Std) dictionary order, case-ins., uppercase pref" is one such sort order
available in both SQL Server 6.5 and SQL Server 7.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server 2.0.
