TITLE   :SMS: Duplicate COMM & SPEC Caused by Failed Child Attachment
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbConfig kbDatabase kbServer kbsms120 kbsms120bug kbDataLoader kbInventory

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft SQL Server administration tools to directly view the
contents of the Systems Management Server (SMS) database, there may be duplicate
values in the COMM and SPEC tables. You may also notice tables that start with
underscores, such as the following:

   _User_Information_COMM

CAUSE
=====

When a child site sends its inventory to a parent site on the initial attachment
or after running PREINST /SYNCPARENT, the *.UPD directory may not be processed
at the parent site. This behavior leaves many of the NextCommonKey and
NextSpecificKey values in the GroupMap table set incorrectly. Normal Management
Information Format (MIF) processing that occurs afterwards results in the
creation of duplicate datakeys in the COMM and SPEC tables.

When the *.UPD directory is not processed completely, there may be tables in the
SMS database that begin with an underscore, as in the example in the "Symptoms"
section.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
