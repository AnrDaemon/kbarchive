SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the HTMLA Web Administration Forms included with Internet

many places (for instance, content expiration). This will mainly be a problem
for the following languages:

   German
   Japanese

The time is displayed in HH:mm format. The following languages would normally be
formatted as follows:

   German: HH:mm:ss (leading zero, 24 hour clock, no am/pm, separator, seconds)

   Japanese: H:mm:ss (no leading zero, 24 hour clock, am/pm DB characters,
   separator, seconds)

   Arabic: hh:mm:ss tt (leading zero, seconds, am/pm used, 12 hour clock,
   separator)

   Russian: H:mm:ss (no leading zero, seconds, no am/pm, 24 hour clock,
   separator)

   Hindi: HH.mm.ss (leading zero, seconds, am/pm Hindi characters, 24 hour clock,
   period as separator)
