TITLE   :SMS: Can't Enforce Security by Group with Sofware Metering
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsmsMeter

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An online client is unable to determine the groups that a user belongs to, and
is therefore unable to enforce security by group. This failure to identify and
apply the permissions to a specified group causes all members of the domain to
be denied the product or products that are restricted by group.

WORKAROUND
==========

Running Restricted Products on Clients That Have Permission
-----------------------------------------------------------

Modify the Software Metering Service account so that it specifies a qualified
domain user account and adds the user account to the domain administrator's
group; to do so, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to Site Systems.

2. Right-click the site system whose Software Metering Service account you want
   to change, and then click Properties.

3. In the Site System Properties dialog box, click the Software Metering Server
   tab, and then click Set.

4. In the Windows NT Account dialog box, specify an account of the form
   domain\account.

5. Click OK in all open dialog boxes.

6. Wait until the next Software Metering server configuration cycle completes;
   open User Manager for Domains to ensure that the account has been created. If
   this is a new server installation, it requires two cycles to complete the
   service account installation as a domain account.

7. Add the newly created domain account to the domain administrator's group
   using User Manager for Domains.

8. If you are modifying the Software Metering Service account to resolve the
   issue after the Software Metering server has been installed, you must stop
   and restart the SMS_LICENSE_SERVER service (use the Services icon in Control
   Panel) on the Software Metering server so that it uses the new account.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
