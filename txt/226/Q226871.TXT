PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Software Metering console Live Status window, the application
that is started will show a counter of -37 seconds.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, synchronize both servers to the same time.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This happens when the software metering server's time setting is ahead of the
site server's setting. If you advance the software metering server clock, this
creates a larger negative number.
