TITLE   :SMS: SWMAccount Is Not Removed from Local Account Database
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsmsMeter

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are on a member server and you uninstall a Software Metering Server
computer, the SWMAccount is not removed from the local account database as
expected.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, when you remove a site system role from a server, be
sure to manually remove the user accounts that were created on the server.
Always review the local account database on that server after the role has been
successfully removed.

If the site system being removed is on a domain controller, use caution when you
remove the remaining user accounts. If another server hosting a site system role
(in this case, software metering) is configured to use the domain account in
question, that site system role will cease to function when the account is
removed from the domain.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
