======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the date and time settings on a Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS)
2.0 client computer that runs the software metering client agent is accidentally
set forward, the client no longer forwards software metering information to the
software metering server when it (the client) is in offline mode. If the date
and time settings are reset correctly, the client does not send data until the
current date and time catch up to the incorrect date and time that had been set.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because when software metering is configured in offline
mode, clients maintain a local log of software usage and then upload this
information to the software metering server on a schedule. The next scheduled
upload is based on the date and time settings of the client. When you reset the
client date and time settings from a future date and time to the current date
and time, the next scheduled upload time is not reset, and the client's
next-upload time remains at the erroneous setting (in the future).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, follow these steps:

1. Refer to the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article, and then remove SMS
   2.0 client components from the computer that displays this behavior:

   Q199078 How to Remove a Systems Management Server 2.0 Client

2. Correct the time on the client.

3. Reinstall the SMS client components.

The only way to work around this issue is to uninstall and then reinstall the SMS
2.0 client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the Client Cleaner tool (20CliCln.bat) to remove all SMS 2.0 client
components. SMSMan.exe may leave some files and registry entries on clients
after being run. You must have Administrator rights on the client computer when
you use the Client Cleaner tool. Otherwise, some SMS 2.0 files and registry
settings will not be removed. 20CliCln.bat can be found in the Systems
Management Server Resource Kit and in the supportability files that come with
SMS 2.0.
