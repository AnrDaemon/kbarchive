TITLE   :SMS: Network Discovery Doesn't Time Out After Failed RPC Call
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Network Discovery does not time out as expected if a network resource such as a
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server or a workstation does not
respond to a remote procedure call (RPC). You may see the following lines
repeatedly in the NetDisc.log:

   ADM: Returning busy from idle status due to outstanding networks in our
   presence.
   ADM: Returning busy from idle status due to DHCP thread being busy.
   DC: Protocol module <AD_ADM.dll> reports it is still busy while checking 
   idle state.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In configurations earlier than Systems Management Server Service Pack 1, if a
network resource (such as a DHCP server or a workstation) fails to return an RPC
call issued from Network Discovery, no discovery data records (DDRs) are
created. Network Discovery sites for Systems Management Server Service Pack 1
and later create DDRs for all resources it discovers before the unsuccessful RPC
call.
