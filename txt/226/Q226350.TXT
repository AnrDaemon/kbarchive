TITLE   :XCLN: Can't Open Additional Mailboxes with Outlook DPA
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When Outlook is configured to open additional mailboxes on startup, it does not
work if Distributed Password Authentication (DPA) is used as authentication
method, and you get the following error message:

   Unable to expand the folder. The set of folders could not be opened. The
   information store could not be opened.

The above problem does not occur when Windows NT LAN Manager (NTLM) is used as
authentication method.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by a logic error in the code. The main difference
between Windows NT and Membership security is that with Membership, one Windows
NT account, the "broker," is mapped to all the Exchange Server mailboxes.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS

version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.
