TITLE   :SMS: 2.0 CD Key Format Differs SQL 6.5 CD Key Format
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms120 kbsms120bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When installing SQL Server 6.5 via SMS Express Setup, the CD key field does not
allow the 15 digit CD key for SQL Server 6.5 to be entered. If you are not
running SMS 2.0 sp1 then in order to workaround this issue you will need to
first install SQL 6.5 and then run the SMS 2.0 Express Setup.

CAUSE
=====

The CD key field found in the Express Setup is formatted xxx-xxxxxxx. The 10
digit format works fine for the SQL 7.0 CD key, but the SQL 6.5 CD key is 15
digits long and formatted xxxxx-xxx-xxxxxxx.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 2.0. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
