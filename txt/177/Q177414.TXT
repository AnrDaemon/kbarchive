TITLE   :Using Incorrect DNS Forwarders Cause High Processor Usage
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your Microsoft Windows NT Domain Name Service (DNS) server may experience times
when the processor usage climbs as high as 90 percent. Your computer may also
appear extremely unresponsive while the processor usage remains at this high
level.

CAUSE
=====

Your DNS server has its own IP address configured as a forwarder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following steps:

1. From DNS Manager, click your DNS server in the Server List.

2. Click Properties on the DNS menu.

3. Click the Forwarders tab, select your DNS server's IP address, and click
   Remove.

4. Click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you set up Microsoft DNS server, you may desire to use Forwarders. When
configuring this setting, it is not necessary to include your own IP address in
the list of forwarders. This setting is used as the next place to look when the
DNS server does not have the name or address in its cache. By including your own
IP address in the forwarders setting, you are creating a resolver loop where the
computer keeps trying to forward queries to itself.
