TITLE   :XWEB: Support for Multiple SSI Providers Is Missing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::2.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Commercial Internet System version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Internet Chat Server does not support two SSPI security providers
at once.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

 - With the fix referenced below applied, Chatsvc.dll supports zero, one, or two
   security providers (such as DPA, RPA, and so forth). To specify two packages,
   enter them in the SSPI Packages box in the Administrator user interface and
   separate them with a single space (for example, DPA NTLM).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a limitation in Microsoft Internet Chat
Server version 2.0 that can affect Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5.

This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):
