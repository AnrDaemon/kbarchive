TITLE   :ADIC Tape Drive Detected and Installed as Quantum 7000
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install the external ADIC DS9700D tape drive, Windows NT may
detect the unit as a Quantum DLT 7000 tape device and load the corresponding
driver (Dlttape.sys) contained on the Windows NT installation compact disc.
After you restart the computer, the following error message may occur:

   DLT tape device could not be found.

NOTE: Control Panel, tape devices will show the DLT tape drive as installed.

CAUSE
=====

The Dlttape.sys driver supplied with Windows NT 4.0 does not support the ADIC
DS9700D tape drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

Go to the following location to download Jan97nt.exe, which contains an updated
Dlttape.sys driver for the ADIC DS9700D tape device:

http://www.legato.com/cgi-bin/devsup.pl?NT/4.3b

The Jan97nt.exe file expands to five files. An explanation of these files is in
the Readme.4.3b file located on the same page. Replace the Dlttape.sys file in
the %systemroot%\system32\drivers folder with the one you just downloaded and
extracted.

Tape drives with updated firmware may require the latest DLT7000.sys driver from
Quantum. If you have a Compaq computer, obtain SP4429 from Compaq.

NOTE: Because Web sites are constantly updated, the site address may change
without notice. If this occurs, please contact the manufacturer directly.
