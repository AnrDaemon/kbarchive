TITLE   :16 or More Link Services of Same Type Show Incorrect Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If 16 or more link services are added in SNA Server Manager, the 16th (and
higher) link service of the same type shows the wrong service name when you view
the Link Service Property page.

If 17 802.2 DLC link services are added in SNA Server Manager, they will be
numbered as follows:

   SnaDlc1
   SnaDlc2
       .
       .
   SnaDlcE
   SnaDlcF
   SnaDlc10
   SnaDlc11

If the link service properties are displayed for one of the link services that
contains 8 characters (for example, SnaDlc10), the 8th character is not
displayed.

For example, the Link Service Property page for SnaDlc10 displays the following
information:

   Service Name: SnaDlc1
   Title: DLC 802.2 Link Service #16
   Adapter: <network adapter name>

The Service Name parameter contains SnaDlc1 instead of SnaDlc10.

CAUSE
=====

The Text Control size is not large enough to contain more than 7 characters for
a link service name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, and 3.0 SP2.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
