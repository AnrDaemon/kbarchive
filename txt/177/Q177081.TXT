Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

NOTE: To reproduce this problem, your system display should be set to 256-color.

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Add a Frame control to Form1.

3. Set the following properties for Form1:

   Property                 Value
   --------                 -----
   Picture                  pastel.dib
   PaletteMode              1-UseZOrder

   The file pastel.dib is located in the Samples\PGuide\PalMode directory where
   you installed Visual Basic.

4. Copy the following code to the Code window of Form1:

         Option Explicit

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            Me.BackColor = RGB(24, 180, 164)
            Frame1.BackColor = RGB(24, 180, 164)
         End Sub

5. Press the F5 key to run the program and note that the Frame background
   appears dithered.
