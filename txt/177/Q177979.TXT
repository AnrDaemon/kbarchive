PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Messages sent from the Internet to the Microsoft Mail Connector (MSMI) that
contain embedded messages may be rejected by the MSMI with a Non-Delivery Report
(NDR).

For example, when a message is sent from Microsoft Mail for PC Networks to an
unknown address on the Internet via a Microsoft Exchange Server, you will
normally receive an NDR for this message. The NDR may contain the original
message as embedded attachment and has to pass through the Microsoft Mail
Connector. At this point, the following Event Id is generated by the MSMI:

   10000 MSExchangeMSMI
   MDBEF parsing failed on Attachment Information.

CAUSE
=====

The embedded message is not handled correctly by the Microsoft Mail Connector
Interchange service.

RESOLUTION
==========
