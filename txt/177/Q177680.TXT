 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Windows NT 4.0 client accesses files on a NetWare server through Gateway
Services for NetWare (GSNW), and if there is a slow link between the Windows NT
4.0 client and GSNW, the Windows NT 4.0 client may not be able to see all the
files in a directory on the NetWare server.

The problem does not appear when there is a LAN between the Windows NT client and
GSNW. The problem does not appear with Windows NT 3.51 clients.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
