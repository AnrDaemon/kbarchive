TITLE   :SNA Client Takes Longer to Connect Than Normal
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the 5250 applet as well as some third-party 5250 emulators, the
Windows NT SNA Client attempting to reconnect to the host may take an extra 20
seconds to restart the session. The first time the emulator connects, the delay
may not be evident, but if disconnected, further attempts to reconnect may take
about 20 seconds.

CAUSE
=====

The Winmgt32.dll display verb initializes the DMOD with the client type "admin,"
and the wappc32.dll initializes the DMOD with the client type "TP." If the same
application uses both DLLs, the DMOD creates two different semaphores, because
the admin type is treated as a special case for no reason. In this case the I/O
threads were signaling the second semaphore, but the "routing" thread was
waiting on the first semaphore. This introduced a five-second delay in each
incoming frame processing.

STATUS
======

With the fix applied, the special semaphore created for "admin" type client
processes is removed.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1
and 3.0 SP2.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
