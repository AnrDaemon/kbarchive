PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVC kbVC100bug kbVC200bug kbOSWinCEsearch kbOSWinCE100

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows CE, versions 1.0, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While installing the product listed above, the Setup program may display an
invalid folder name, such as "/:/Program Files," and state that the folder
cannot be created.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Visual C++ version 5.0 registry keys are missing contents or are
corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can resolve this problem by setting up the Microsoft Visual C++ registry
correctly. One of the following methods can be used to resolve this problem:

 - Microsoft Visual C++ was not installed with the current user profile. If you
   originally installed Microsoft Visual C++ version 5.0 using a different user
   account/domain, use the same one when installing Microsoft Visual C++ for
   Windows CE version 1.0.

 - Microsoft Visual C++ version 5.0 may not be installed. If you have only
   installed other Microsoft Developer Studio based products such as Microsoft
   Visual J++ or Microsoft Visual InterDev, you may experience this problem. You
   must install Microsoft Visual C++ version 5.0 to use Microsoft Visual C++ for
   Windows CE version 1.0.

 - The Microsoft Developer Studio registry keys may be corrupted. To resolve
   this problem, uninstall Microsoft Visual C++ version 5.0, reboot and then
   re-install Microsoft Visual C++ version 5.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft product listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
