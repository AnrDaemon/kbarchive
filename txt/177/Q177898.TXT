TITLE   :Dragging LUs Between Pools of the Same Type Does Not Work
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you drag LUs from either an LUA or Downstream LU pool to another pool of
the same type, the operation fails, which causes an SNAOLE error to be generated
indicating that the

   Target record already has an owner.

NOTE: The same behavior can occur when you drag 3270 LUs between 3270 Display LU
Pools.

SNA Manager does not allow LUs to be dragged between different pools. However, it
does not currently display a useful error message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, and 3.0 SP2.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, LUs still cannot be dragged within the same pool or from
one pool to another. However, instead of the SNAOLE error message, you see a
symbol that indicates that you are not allowed to drop the LU in the pool. If
you hold the LU over the pool, a pop-up message tells you that the LU is owned
by another pool.
