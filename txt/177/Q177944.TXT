TITLE   :XFOR: Incorrect Spacing in RTFHTML Messages w/ Outlook Express
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Incoming and outbound Internet messages passing through an Exchange Server
version 5.0 Internet Mail Service may appear to be spaced incorrectly. Though
the messages may arrive and be readable in an Exchange or Outlook client, the
RTFHTML converter that allows the item to be readable in an Outlook Web Access
or Outlook Express (Internet mail) client will display the messages with
incorrect line spacing.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.

This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
