======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You cannot use your pointing device to select more than one type of media from
an article in Microsoft Bookshelf 98. For example, if you open the dictionary
article about Christopher Columbus, you can use the pointing device to select
either the article text or the image, but you cannot select both the text and
the image at the same time.

NOTE: This issue does not occur in Microsoft Bookshelf 99.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you want to copy text and media together from a Bookshelf 98 article and
paste it into another program, use the following steps:

1. On the Search All tab or the Find Media tab, click the article you want to
   copy text and media from.

2. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

3. Switch to the program into which you want to paste the text and media you
   just copied.

4. On the Edit menu, click Paste.

NOTE: Because these steps copy the entire contents of the article, you may want
to delete unwanted sections of the article. To do so, select the text or media
you want to delete, and then press the DELETE key.
