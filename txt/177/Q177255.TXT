SYMPTOMS
========

When you set your default e-mail program as Microsoft Outlook Express on the
Programs tab in the Internet Properties dialog box, Microsoft Outlook 97 may
continue to open when you attempt to send or receive e-mail on MSN, The
Microsoft Network.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Outlook may still be set as the default MSN e-mail program.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To set Outlook Express as the default MSN e-mail program, use Registry Editor to
