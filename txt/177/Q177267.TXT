TITLE   :FIX: Unattended Setup Disables EnableDHCPFlag on Second Adapter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbOPK kbSBK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform an unattended installation on a system that is multihomed and
the answer file (Unattend.txt) has the parameter DHCP = YES in the TCP/IP
parameters section, only the first adapter will receive an IP address. The
second adapter will be set to use a static IP address in which the IP address
and subnet mask are blank.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by the EnableDHCPFlag in Oemnxptc.inf being set to 0 (zero),
which means off, for the second adapter.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, modify the Oemnxptc.inf file on the distribution
share so that it checks to see if STF_GUI_UNATTENDED is set to YES.

1. On your distribution share, expand the Oemnxptc.in_ file by typing the
   following at the command prompt:

   "Expand Oemnxptc.in_ Oemnxptc.inf" (without the quotation marks)

2. Rename the compressed Oemnxptc.in_ file to Oemnxptc.sav.

   This step is required because this not only offers a backup copy of the file
   but the setup program will always use the compressed version of the file if
   both are present.

3. Use any text editor to modify the following section of the .inf file:

   Before modifications are made:

   [InstallOption]
   set Option   = $($1)
   set SrcDir   = $($2)
   set AddCopy  = $($3)
   set DoCopy   = $($4)
   set DoConfig = $($5)
   set InstallFromRas = $($6)
   set EnableDHCPFlag = $($7)
   set InstallList = $($8)
   ifstr(i) $(EnableDHCPFlag) == ""
   set EnableDHCPFlag = 0
   Debug-Output "DHCP Phase 1 Flag :"$(EnableDHCPFlag)
   Debug-Output "DHCP Phase 1 Adapter :"$(EnableDHCPForThisAdapter)
   endif
   ifstr(i) $(InstallList) == ""
   set InstallList = {"1","1","0","0","0","0","0","0"}

   After modification are made:

   [InstallOption]
   set Option   = $($1)
   set SrcDir   = $($2)
   set AddCopy  = $($3)
   set DoCopy   = $($4)
   set DoConfig = $($5)
   set InstallFromRas = $($6)
   set EnableDHCPFlag = $($7)
   set InstallList = $($8)
   ifstr(i) $(EnableDHCPFlag) == ""
   set EnableDHCPFlag = 0
   ;**************modified code begins here****************
   Ifstr(i) $(!STF_GUI_UNATTENDED) == YES
   set EnableDHCPFlag = 1
   endif
   ;**************Modifications end here******************
   Debug-Output "DHCP Phase 1 Flag :"$(EnableDHCPFlag)
   Debug-Output "DHCP Phase 1 Adapter :"$(EnableDHCPForThisAdapter)
   endif
   ifstr(i) $(InstallList) == ""
   set InstallList = {"1","1","0","0","0","0","0","0"}

4. Save the file and begin your unattended setup.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Windows NT version
4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
