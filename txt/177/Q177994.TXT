SUMMARY
=======

A CICS LINK Remote Environment (RE) is used. A CICS COBOL application program is
invoked when the client application invokes a COMTI method. The CICS program
issues the EXEC CICS LINK command to start another CICS program. CICS abend ADPL
occurs in the program being linked to.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The IBM "CICS/ESA Messages and Codes" manual provides the following information
regarding the abend ADPL:

   Explanation: A server program has issued a command which is restricted in the
   distributed program link (DPL) environment. Certain API and CPI- RR requests,
   and the DL/I terminate request are not allowed in the DPL environment. See
   the CICS/ESA Application Programming Guide for a list of these restricted
   commands.

   A server program is a program which has been remotely linked, or a Program
   defined to run with the DPL subset.

Existing and new applications should be examined to verify that they do not use
commands that are not supported under DPL.
