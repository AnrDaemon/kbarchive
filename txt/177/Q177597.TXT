TITLE   :XFOR: Delivery and Read Reports Do Not Appear in Lotus Notes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you send a message with an attached Delivery or Read report from a Microsoft
Exchange client or Outlook client to a Lotus Notes client via the Exchange
Connector for Lotus Notes, the Notes client receives the message, but the
attached report is not present.

CAUSE
=====

When the message with the attached report is being processed, the Exchange
Connector for Lotus Notes strips the attached report from the message. Any other
part of the message such as text or other attachments remains intact.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you must send a Read or Delivery report to a Notes client, perform the
following steps to work around the problem:

1. From the open message, click Insert on the toolbar.

2. Select Item and choose the report from the list of messages.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
