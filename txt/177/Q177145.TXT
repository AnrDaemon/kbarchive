TITLE   :PRB: Error Changing DynamicCurrentControl of Grid Column
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp500 kbvfp500a

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you switch between controls in a grid's column at run-time the following
error message appears:

   Expression is invalid, use a valid expression for
   DynamicCurrentControl.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you set or change the DynamicCurrentControl property of a grid's Column,
use '"combo1"' (an additional pair of quotes around the control string) instead
of "combo1." Here's an example:

      ThisForm.Grid1.Column1.DynamicCurrentControl = '"combo1"'

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a database, named Data1, and add a new table, Table1, with two fields.
   The first field will be ID(C10) and the second field will be Name(C20). Next,
   insert some records into the table.

2. Create a new form and include Table1 in its DataEnvironment. Drag the table
   onto the form to create a grid control based on the table.

3. Add a combo box control in Grid.Column1.

4. Add a command button to the form, and type the following code in the Click
   event:

         ThisForm.Grid1.Column1.DynamicCurrentControl = "combo1"
         ThisForm.Refresh

5. Run the form and click the command button to produce the error:

         Expression is invalid, use a valid expression for
         DynamicCurrentControl.

   NOTE: Using views causes the same error.

Additional query words: DynamicCurrentControl grid combobox views
