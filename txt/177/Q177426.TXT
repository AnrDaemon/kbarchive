======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (32-bit), versions 6.11, 6.11a, 6.11c, 6.11d, 6.12, 6.13, 6.14 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 1.52 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

CodeView for Windows (Cvw.exe), which is included with Microsoft MASM version
6.11 and 16-bit editions of Microsoft Visual C++, does not run in the Microsoft
Windows NT operating systems.

In Microsoft Windows NT, you may get the following error message even though the
Cvw1.386 file has an entry in System.ini file:

   CVW1.386 is not loaded in SYSTEM.INI. Please reinstall CVW

CodeView for Windows will run in Windows 95 and 98; however, you may get the
following error messages:

   Could not load debuggee, Unknown error in Windows (22)

-and/or-

   Could not load debuggee, Windows is out of memory (1)

CAUSE
=====

If you get the first message, then the application has installed a callback that
causes notifications to be issued, calling OutputDebugString() for example.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q99671 INF: Chaining NotifyRegister Callbacks Issuing Notifications

For the second error message, you may have loaded Emm386.exe in the Config.sys
file. Reboot the machine after removing the line loading Emm386.exe by typing
REM before device. Or, reboot after increasing memory when Emm386.exe is loaded,
adding the RAM command as shown below:

   device=C:\Windows\HIMEM.SYS
   device=c:\Windows\emm386.exe 4096 RAM

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use CodeView (Cv.exe) for MS-DOS in Microsoft Windows 95 and Microsoft
Windows NT for debugging MS-DOS applications.

Usually MASM version 6.11 code is written as an MS-DOS .exe file and CodeView for
MS-DOS (Cv.exe) can be used to debug this type of application. Rarely do
programmers write Windows applications in MASM.

Windows applications written in MASM can be debugged using the Visual C++
integrated debugger (use version 1.52 if you are writing a 16-bit application,
or use version 4.0 or later if you are writing a 32-bit application). Create a
dummy project, using the same name and project directory as the MASM .exe file,
in the Visual C++ IDE. Start the debugger and ignore all the messages about the
project build.

Note that the Programmers Work Bench (PWB) used for developing MASM programs
works in both Windows 95 and Windows NT. It is advisable that you run the
New-vars.bat file in an MS-DOS window from the \Binr folder of the MASM
installation before using PWB.
