TITLE   :XFOR: SNADS and PROFS Connectors Do Not Convert Note Objects
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Outlook Note (New Note) command allows the creation of folder-style notepad
items. These note objects are stored as Rich Text Format (RTF) and are not
interpreted by the SNADS and PROFS connectors. When a Microsoft Exchange Server
user sends a "note" to a SNADS or PROFS user, the whole object is sent
uninterpreted.

CAUSE
=====

RTF to EBCDIC conversion is not currently supported.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: convert
