======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The following may occur when you have added an envelope to your document:

 - When you print, the Return Address may not print on the envelope.

   -or-

 - When you click Envelopes and Labels on the Tools menu, the Return Address may
   not show on the Envelopes tab.

CAUSE
=====

The insertion point is in the document text area. When the insertion point is in
the document (and not in the attached envelope), the return address will not
print or show on the Envelopes tab.

NOTE: To view the Envelopes tab, click Envelopes and Labels on the Tools menu.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the appropriate method to work around your particular situation.

Method 1: Place the Insertion Point in the Envelope
---------------------------------------------------

Before you print or view the Envelope tab, move the insertion point into the
envelope that is attached to your document.

Method 2: Use the EnvelopeExtra1 AutoText for the Return Address
----------------------------------------------------------------

You can use an AutoText entry (EnvelopeExtra1) to add additional information to
an envelope. The AutoText entry can be helpful for automatically including a
company logo or other object or text in the return address on an envelope.

NOTE: The EnvelopeAddress1 AutoText will not show on the Envelopes tab, but when
you add the envelope to a document, the Return Address (EnvelopeAddress1) will
be added to the envelope and will print.
