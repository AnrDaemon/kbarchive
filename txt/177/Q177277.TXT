The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to create and share a printer on a computer running
both Windows NT Server and File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) for use by
both Microsoft and NetWare network clients.

To share a printer with File and Print Services for NetWare, you must first share
the printer for Microsoft network clients. No other steps are required to share
the printer with File and Print Services for NetWare.

FPNW builds its list of shared network printers for NetWare clients by
enumerating the list of printers shared for Microsoft network clients. FPNW
advertises the printer name, rather than the share name, as the NetWare print
queue name.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To set up an FPNW printer to share to Novell NetWare clients, use the following
steps:

1. Create the printer using any method to establish connection with the printer
   (that is, LPT1:, DLC, LPR, HP JetDirect Port, and so on).

2. Name the printer. The Printer name is the name that NetWare network clients
   will see when connecting to the print server.

3. Share the printer. The Share name is the name Microsoft network clients will
   see when browsing resources on the print server.

NOTE: The FPNW Print Servers menu option available in Server Manager should not
be used to create FPNW printer shares. This option is only used to configure
FPNW to print to NetWare printers running Pserver.

For information on printing to Pserver printers, query on the following words in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Pserver FPNW

For information specifically on how to configure FPNW to service Pserver
printers, please see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
