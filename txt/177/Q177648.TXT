-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service Update for Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect a Remote Access Service (RAS) client to your
multihomed RAS Server or Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) Server, which
is also a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server, the client may get
the following error:

   TCP/IP CP reported error 733: The PPP control protocol for this network
   protocol is not available on the server.

On your RAS server, Event Viewer may log one or more of the following event
messages:

   Event ID   : 1011
   Source     : DhcpServer
   Description: The DHCP server issued a NACK to the client
                (5241532090DAE6D09FD4BC0101000000) for the address
                (160.62.1.126) request.

NOTE: The hardware address and the IP address above will be different for your
network environment.


-or-

   Event ID   : 20091
   Source     : RemoteAccess
   Description: The remote Access Server was unable to acquire an IP
                Addresss from the DHCP Server to be used on the Server
                Adapter. Incoming user will be unable to connect using IP.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, you will need to reconfigure your RAS server to use a
static pool of IP addresses. If the addresses that you use exist within the
scope of addresses in your DHCP server scopes, you also need to exclude the
range in DHCP Manager.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
