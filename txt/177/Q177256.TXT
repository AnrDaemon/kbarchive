DOCUMENT:Q177256  10-AUG-2001  [winnt]
TITLE   :No Validation When Logging on Locally to a WINS Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to log on locally to your Windows NT Windows Internet Name
Service (WINS) server, you may receive the following error:

   No domain controller was available to validate your logon.

CAUSE
=====

The Netlogon service may have started before the WINS service completely
started.

RESOLUTION
==========

After you start your WINS server, give the WINS service ample time to start
before logging on locally.

NOTE: The amount of time will vary depending upon the hardware and software
configuration of your WINS server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A correctly configured WINS server should be set to register and resolve NetBIOS
names only with itself (as both primary and secondary server). The local WINS
configuration information can be viewed using either of the following:

 - The WINS tab of the TCP/IP Protocol properties within the Network applet of
   Control Panel

   -or-

 - Ipconfig.exe /all from a command prompt.

Although this is the correct configuration for a WINS server, it is possible for
the Netlogon service to start before the WINS service. As a result, the Netlogon
service will not be able to resolve the DOMAIN[1Ch] entry required for domain
logon validation.
