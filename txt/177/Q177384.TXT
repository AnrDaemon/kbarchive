SUMMARY
=======

The address parsing or search routines in Microsoft Expedia Streets 98 have some
functionality limitations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you search for a specific street address using Expedia Streets 98, keep the
following guidelines in mind:

 - House numbers must be numeric. For example, Expedia Streets can find "1
   Microsoft Way," but may not find "One Microsoft Way."

 - Expedia Streets divides road names into parts: a street name and a street
   type. For example, "1st Avenue" has a street name of "1st" and a street type
   of "Avenue."

   Road names which have a street name that is the same as a street type may not
   be found by Expedia Streets. For example, "Court Avenue" or "Circle Drive"
   may not be found, because both "Court" and "Circle" are street types.

 - If an area contains more than one road with the same name AND one of the
   roads does not have street address data associated with it, when you search
   for a house number, Expedia Streets may not find a match for houses on either
   road.

   For example, assume there is a "Memory Lane" and "Memory Circle" in the same
   area. When you click on "Memory Lane," Expedia Streets may display "325
   Memory Lane" indicating that you clicked on the location of house number 325.
   However, if you click on "Memory Circle", Expedia Streets may display "Memory
   Circle" without a house number, because Expedia Streets does not have street
   address data for that road.

   As a result of this limitation, if you are searching for "325 Memory Lane"
   using the Find An Address command, Expedia Streets may only find "Memory
   Lane," and not "325 Memory Lane."

The Expedia Streets online Help file discusses techniques to improve the number
and quality of matches if you search for a specific street address. The best
technique is to search only for the street name and remove the house number from
the address.
