The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you configure SNA Server to support single sign-on (SSO) to an AS/400, you
may be prompted with an AS/400 sign-on screen when you try to log on. In many
environments, this is unacceptable and defeats the purpose of SSO. This can be
avoided by modifying a system value on the AS/400.

The QRMTSIGN system value specifies whether automatic sign-on from a remote
system is allowed. If this value is set to *FRCSIGNON, the passthrough session
begins with the normal sign-on screen and the user cannot achieve the benefits
of full SSO. If the QRMTSIGN system value is set to *SAMEPRF or *VERIFY,
passthrough sessions will bypass the normal sign-on procedure.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. To use the operating system command to update or verify the system value,
   enter

   command WRKSYSVAL QRMTSIGN

   at a command line and press F4.

   NOTE: The user must have appropriate privileges (security officer or
   administrator) to change system values on the AS/400.

Display QRMTSIGN value
----------------------

1. Select Option 5 to display the current settings for QRMTSIGN. If the remote
   sign-on control is *FRCSIGNON, press F3 to return to the Work with System
   Values menu.

Change QRMTSIGN value
---------------------

1. Select Option 2 to go to the Change System Value menu. In the Remote sign-on
   control field, type in *SAMEPRF or *VERIFY . See Figure 1 below.
