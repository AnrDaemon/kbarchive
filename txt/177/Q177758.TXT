SUMMARY
=======

You can use the Parental Control feature of Microsoft Bookshelf to hide
potentially offensive content. When enabled, the Parental Control feature hides
articles in Bookshelf that contain words which are labeled as vulgar, vulgar
slang, offensive, offensive slang, or obscene in the American Heritage
Dictionary.

Because many words have more than one definition or usage, some words that are
not usually considered offensive may be hidden, and some words that are
potentially offensive are not hidden. For example, the word "yellow" is hidden
by Parental Control because one of its definitions is labeled as offensive, and
the word "sex" is not hidden because none of its definitions are labeled as
vulgar, offensive, or obscene.

NOTE: This issue has been resolved in Bookshelf 99.

You can enable or disable Parental Control at any time after you install
Bookshelf. Parental Control restrictions are always applied to Bookshelf Daily
and the QuickQuote tool, even when Parental Control is disabled.

You can also restrict the ability to enable or disable Parental Control with a
password.
