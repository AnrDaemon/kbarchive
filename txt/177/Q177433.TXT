======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows CE, versions 1.0, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you build a project under Microsoft Visual C++ versions 5.0 or 6.0 with the
Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows CE product installed, the following message
appears in the build output window:

   Error spawning empfile.exe

CAUSE
=====

The application is being built for the "Win32 (WCE x86em)" platform on Microsoft
Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Millemmium Edition (Me). Windows CE Emulation
is not supported these platforms.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Windows CE emulation development facility requires Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
or Windows 2000. If a standard Intel application was intended, select or add a
configuration for the "Win32" platform.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Refer to the following link in the Visual C++ for Windows CE 1.0 online help for
more information regarding requirements, features, and restrictions when using
Windows CE emulation:
