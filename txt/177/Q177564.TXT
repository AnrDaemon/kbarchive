TITLE   :TN3270 Server Access Violation in SRSGetSpecificResource
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11,2.11 SP1,2.11 SP2,3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The TN3270 service may unexpectedly stop responding, causing all attached TN3270
client users to lose their sessions. When this occurs, an
<ntroot>\drwtsn32.log file may be created, indicating a "FAULT" in the
following routine:

   FramePtr  RetAddr   Param1   Param2   Param3   Function Name
   0c74fc94  0011c0e2  0bf62c18 0bf64382 0bf643d4
   TN3SERVR!SRSGetSpecificResource+0x28e

The TN3270 service must be restarted to recover.

CAUSE
=====

This TN3270 failure can occur if an LUA Pool (with an active session) is deleted
from the configuration file. Further attempts to access the pool will lead to a
TN3270 access violation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 2.11
(including SP1 and SP2) and 3.0 (including SP1 and SP2).

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
