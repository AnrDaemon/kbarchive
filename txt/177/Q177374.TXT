TITLE   :XCON: Disable BilateralInformation and IternalTraceInformation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA) may receive an NDR
for a message sent containing BilateralInformation or 1984 MOTIS
InternalTraceInformation. Some X.400 MTAs are not able to accommodate the
information and discard the message or return a non-delivery report (NDR).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.0. To avoid the NDR, you now have the option to strip this
information. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

   S E R V P A C K


MORE INFORMATION
================

The information can be masked by setting the heuristics property for the X.400
connector as:

0x400 : Strip Bilateral Information
0x800 : Strip Internal Trace Information (on 1984 only)

For additional information in reference to setting the heuristics property, see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q169685 XFOR: When You Select "Remote clients support MAPI," BP9 Is Not Sent
   with Forwarded Messages

Please be aware these values are in hex and cumulative in nature (0x000).

BilateralInformation or 1984 MOTIS InternalTraceInformation is a mandatory field
that some MTAs do not accommodate.
