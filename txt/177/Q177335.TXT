SUMMARY
=======

With a Microsoft Windows NT Server computer that is using the Microsoft Routing
and Remote Access Service (RRAS) Update, you may want to create a Point-to-Point
Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) interface that automatically connects to a PPTP server
when a resource is requested. This article discusses the steps needed to create
a demand dial PPTP interface.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To configure a demand dial PPTP connection, use the following steps:

NOTE: The following procedure assumes that you have successfully installed RRAS
and PPTP.

1. From Routing and RAS Admin, right-click LAN and Demand Dial Interfaces and
   then click Add Interface.

2. Use the Demand Dial Wizard to create a Demand Dial interface for a
   Point-to-Point (PPP) connection using a modem or ISDN RAS device and
   appropriate phone number.

   NOTE: In a branch office that uses the Internet, the phone number would be the
   phone number of the local Internet Service Provider (ISP).

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2, but use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) RAS device and
   the IP address of the PPTP server.

   NOTE: In a branch office that uses the Internet, the IP address would be the
   IP address of the PPTP server's Internet interface.

4. From Routing and RAS Admin, expand the IP Routing folder, right-click Static
   Routes, and then click Add Static Route.

5. Create a static host route to the PPTP server's PPP interface. An example is
   shown below where the IP address of the PPTP Server is 192.100.100.1:

      Destination : 192.100.100.1
      Network Mask: 255.255.255.255
      Gateway     : 1.1.1.1
      Metric      : 1
      Interface   : PPP Connection to the ISP

6. Create a static route (or routes) for the IP network IDs of the corporate
   intranet that will be accessed through the PPTP tunnel. An example is shown
   below where the corporate intranet network ID is 10.0.0.0:

      Destination : 10.0.0.0
      Network Mask: 255.0.0.0
      Gateway     : 1.1.1.1
      Metric      : 1
      Interface   : PPTP Connection to the Corporate network

The PPTP tunnel is automatically bought up through the following process (using
the example information above):

1. Packets destined for the network ID 10.0.0.0 are forwarded using the
   corporate intranet static route to the "PPTP Connection to the Corporate
   network" interface object.

2. The PPTP Connection to the Corporate network interface object must establish
   a PPTP tunnel with the PPTP Server at its configured IP address of
   192.100.100.1.

3. To establish a tunnel, a TCP connection must be established.

4. TCP connection packets to the address of 192.100.100.1 are forwarded to the
   "PPP Connection to ISP" interface object using the host route for the
   corporate PPTP Server.

5. The "PPP Connection to ISP" interface is connected.

6. The PPTP tunnel is connected over the PPP connection.

7. Packets sent to the corporate intranet are sent over the PPTP tunnel.
