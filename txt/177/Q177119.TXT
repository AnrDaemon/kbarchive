SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to create any zone in Domain Name Service (DNS) Manager, you
receive the following error:

   The new zone could not be created because there is already a zone by
   this name.

Event Viewer on your DNS server may also log one or more of the following event
messages in the System event log:

   Event ID   : 100
   Source     : DNS
   Description: DNS server could not open the file 'zone name'.

-or-

   Event ID   : 104
   Source     : DNS
   Description: Could not open Database 'zone name' for DNS.

-or-

   Event ID   : 150
   Source     : DNS
   Description: Could not create 'zone name'.

-or-

   Event ID   : 242
   Source     : DNS
   Description: Encountered invalid Domain username.domainname.


CAUSE
=====

The above issue may be caused by either of the following:

 - The user account that you are using to create the new zones contains one or
   more spaces in its name

   -or-

 - The built-in "SYSTEM" account does not have "FULL CONTROL" permissions on
   <NT_Root>\System32\DNS\.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, perform one of the following:

 - Rename the current user account removing any spaces

   -or-

 - If you have an NTFS partition, verify that the built-in SYSTEM account has
   FULL CONTROL permissions on the %SystemRoot%\System32\DNS folder
