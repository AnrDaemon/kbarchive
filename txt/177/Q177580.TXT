TITLE   :LU1 Print Jobs Formatted Incorrectly when Using Bypass GDI, PDT
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an LU1 type host print job is printed through a 3270 Print Session configured
on SNA Server, the output may be formatted incorrectly if the last portion of
the print data being passed from the SNA Server service to the Host Print
service in an 3270/FMI frame begins with an SCS Control Code. In addition, this
will only occur if the 3270 print session is configured to bypass GDI and to use
a PDT file.

One reported case of this problem caused the end of one print job to print at the
beginning of the next print job. This occurred because the last portion of the
first print job was sent to the print service in an 3270/FMI frame that began
with the SCS Control Code for a Form Feed ('0x0C').

CAUSE
=====

The Host Print Service loses the end of the last portion of the print data in an
LU1 type print job if all the following conditions are met:

 - The 3270/FMI frame of the print job begins with an SCS Control Code.

 - The 3270 print session is configured with the Bypass GDI option selected.

 - The 3270 print session is configured to use a PDT file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, and 3.0 SP2.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
