======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you press an ALT+key combination (generating a WM_SYSCOMMAND) with keyboard
focus on the property page for an MFC ActiveX control and the key does not
correspond to a mnemonic on the page, you will get a stack overflow.

CAUSE
=====

COlePropertyPage::WindowProc() traps the WM_SYSCOMMAND and calls
IPropertyPageSite::TranslateAccelerator(). This function in turns sends the
WM_SYSCOMMAND message back to the page. This results in a recursion until you
run out of stack space.

RESOLUTION
==========

Override COlePropertyPage::WindowProc() and return TRUE if the message is a
WM_SYSCOMMAND; for example:

      LRESULT CMyPropPage::WindowProc(UINT msg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
      {

         //Return without processing if WM_SYSCOMMAND.
         if (WM_SYSCOMMAND == msg)
            return TRUE;
         else
            return COlePropertyPage::WindowProc(msg, wParam, lParam);
      }

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual
C++ version 6.0 for Windows.
