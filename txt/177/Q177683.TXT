TITLE   :Print Browse List May Not Refresh Location Information
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you add or change the location information for a printer share when you are
browsing a Windows NT print server, you may not be able to see the added or
changed information (for example, a room number).

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, stop sharing the printer, and then share the
printer again. After you restart sharing and then select the print server under
the domain to which it belongs, the location information should be visible.

NOTE: If you select the computer name of the print server directly in the browse
window, the displayed location information remains unchanged.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51 and
4.0.
