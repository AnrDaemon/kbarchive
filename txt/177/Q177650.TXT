TITLE   :Remote Shutdown Fails If User Is Logged On Without Rights
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The remote shutdown of a Windows NT 4.0 server (or workstation) with
shutdown.exe from the Windows NT resource kit does not work if the "Shut down
the system" right is removed for the currently logged on user of this server (or
workstation).

The remote shutdown also fails if a user without this right has locked the
Windows NT server (or workstation) by clicking Lock Workstation after performing
a CTRL+ALT+DELETE key combination.

CAUSE
=====

To shut down the computer a separate thread is created in the context of the
logged on user to shutdown the machine. Since the user does not have shutdown
privilege this fails.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
