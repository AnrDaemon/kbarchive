TITLE   :XADM: NT Security Descriptor Associated w/ DL Owner Not Updated
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you make changes to a distribution list (DL), an error may occur if a new
Windows NT account has been assigned to the mailbox which is the owner of that
DL. You may receive the following error message:

   Changes to the distribution list membership could not be saved.
   You do not have the sufficient permissions to perform this
   operation on this object.

CAUSE
=====

The error occurs when you change who has the role of user on the Permissions tab
of a mailbox. This does not happen when the owner of the DL is changed by
selecting a different mailbox.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem, open the Distribution List General property page for
the mailbox you want to configure, make a change to the DL (for example, type
something in the Notes box), and then close the dialog box. This will cause the
Owner's Mailbox for the newly assigned user to be re- checked and will allow the
newly assigned user permission to update the DL.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
