TITLE   :SMSINST: SMS Installer Ignores REG_NONE Key Changes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:smsinst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server Installer does not detect registry changes for the
REG_NONE value type and does not create registry values for REG_NONE when an
application is repackaged. REG_NONE is a registry value type created by the
registry APIs.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use either of the following methods to work around this problem.

Method 1
--------

1. After the software is installed you can export the registry tree to a text
   file.

2. Create a batch file that calls REGINI to import the text file into the
   registry.

3. Create a Systems Management Server package to distribute the files to the
   clients.

Method 2
--------

Manually script and compile a separate Systems Management Server Installer
package to update the registry with the changes that were not added to the
script during the Repackage operation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
Installer version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
