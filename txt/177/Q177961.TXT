KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on as a user to a computer running Exchange Server 5.5 (server A)
with Outlook client and send a message with MIME and RTFHTML to a user on a
computer running Exchange 5.0 with Service Pack 1 (server B), the recipient may
see garbled symbols and characters in the message body when the message is
opened.

The two Exchange Server computers are connected through the Internet. The
Internet Mail Service on the sending and receiving Exchange Server computers is
set for both MIME and non-MIME.

CAUSE
=====

This garbled text appears in the received message due to content conversion
failure. This content conversion failure may be due to interoperability issues
between Exchange 5.0 schema and Exchange 5.5 schema.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.

This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
