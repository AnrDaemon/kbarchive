SYMPTOMS

ODBC Trace may fail after you install the Traditional Chinese (TC) version of
Visual FoxPro version 5.0x under the Traditional Chinese version of Windows 95

From the \Distrib.src\system folder, under the folder where Visual FoxPro 5.0x
is installed, copy the Odbctrac.dll file to the Windows system folder
C:\Windows\System.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
