TITLE   :XADM: -1022 or -1026 Error Verifying Consistency of Databases
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to use the Edbutil.exe program with the /C switch to verify the
consistency of the Dir.edb or Priv.edb file, a -1022 error indicating that a
disk I/O error has occurred may be displayed. A -1026 error indicating that a
record has exceeded the maximum size may be displayed instead of a -1022 error
when you attempt to verify the consistency of the Priv.edb file.

If you use the Edbutil.exe program with the /D, /DS, and /R switches to
defragment the Dir.edb or Priv.edb file, the defragmentation process finishes
successfully. However, if you then attempt to verify the consistency of the
file, you experience the symptoms described above again.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
