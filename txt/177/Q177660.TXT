TITLE   :Access Violation Occurs in Sfmprint.exe on Busy Print Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Print Services for Macintosh in Windows NT 4.0 may cause an access violation in
Sfmprint.exe. Also, Sfmprint.exe may spin at 100 percent CPU usage just before
the access violation.

CAUSE
=====

A condition exists where an access violation results from the same print job
being deleted twice on a busy print server. The print job is removed and then
the same associated memory address is immediately used for another print job.
The address is erroneously freed a second time for the first job. This caused an
access violation when the address was referenced again.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
