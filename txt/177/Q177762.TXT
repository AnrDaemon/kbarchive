TITLE   :XADM: Access Violation (0xc0000005) During Exchange Setup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you are installing Exchange Server version 5.5 on a computer with a 15-
character NetBIOS machine name, the event service will send the following Dr.
Watson error message at the end of Setup:

   events.exe
   Exception: Access violation (0xc0000005), address 0x00405766

This error message will appear when Setup has finished and is starting the
Exchange services, immediately before you are prompted to run the Optimizer
Wizard or exit Setup.

WORKAROUND
==========

The Microsoft Exchange Event Server generates the Dr. Watson error message only
during Setup. After installation, you can manually start the service or allow
Windows NT to automatically start the service after any subsequent restarts.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
