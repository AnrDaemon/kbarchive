KEYWORDS:kberrmsg word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you close a document and then quit Microsoft Word, you may receive the
following error message:

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down. If the
   problem persists, contact the program vendor.

   If you click Details, you receive the following message:

   WINWORD caused an invalid page fault in module WINWORD.EXE.

If you close a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation and then quit Microsoft
PowerPoint, you may receive the following error message:

   PowerPoint encountered an error that it could not correct.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs if both of the following are true:

 - The file properties keywords contain more than 255 characters.

   -and-

 - Journaling of Microsoft Word or Microsoft PowerPoint is enabled in Microsoft
   Outlook 97.


WORKAROUND
==========

Use one of the following methods to work around the problem.

Method 1: Reduce the Length of the Keywords
-------------------------------------------

The problem occurs only if the file keywords contain more than 255 characters. If
you delete or shorten the document keywords so that they contain fewer than 255
characters, the problem will not occur.

Method 2: Disable Outlook Journaling of Word or PowerPoint
----------------------------------------------------------

Outlook journaling is a feature in Microsoft Outlook that tracks and records when
files are opened, closed, or modified. If you disable this feature for Microsoft
Word and Microsoft PowerPoint, the problem will no longer occur on that
particular computer. To disable Outlook journaling for Microsoft Word or
Microsoft PowerPoint, follow these steps:

1. Start Microsoft Outlook 97.

2. On the Tools menu, click Options.

3. Click the Journal tab.

4. Click to clear the "Always record files from Microsoft Word" or the "Always
   record files from Microsoft PowerPoint" check boxes, and then click OK.

5. Quit and then restart Microsoft Outlook 97.

NOTE: When working with a file that is opened by multiple users, Outlook
journaling needs to be disabled on each workstation that is opening the file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been corrected in Microsoft
Outlook 98.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem does not occur with other file properties because they will only
accept a maximum of 255 characters.

This problem does not occur in Microsoft Excel because Microsoft Excel does not
support journaling for the keyword strings.
