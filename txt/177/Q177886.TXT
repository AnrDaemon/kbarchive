MORE INFORMATION
================

The faulting thread's stack may look similar to the following in a
DRWTSN32.LOG:

   FramePtr  RetAddr   Param1   Param2   Param3   Function Name
   06b1ff4c  00443e4b  005e3226 02abc514 06b1ff8c EMSMTA!oxpmroer+0x178

When restarting the MTA, MTACHECK will be run which will move the corrupted
object out of the way. This will allow the MTA to start successfully and normal
operation should resume.
