TITLE   :PRB: READ EVENTS in Form's Init Causes the Form Not to Display

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A form does not display when you run the form.

CAUSE
=====

If you issue a READ EVENTS in the Init or Load event, the form does not get a
chance to display before going into the event loop.

RESOLUTION
==========

Here are two resolutions:

 - Place the READ EVENTS command in a method other than Init or Load.

-or-

 - Use the ON KEY LABEL command to issue a CLEAR EVENTS. For example, place the
   following command in the Init event of the form:

         ON KEY LABEL ALT+X CLEAR EVENTS

and In the Destroy event of the form place the following command:

         ON KEY LABEL ALT+X

Now, after you run the form, when program execution stops at the READ EVENTS, you
can press the ALT+X keys to clear the READ EVENTS and continue with program
execution.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create and run a FoxPro program with the following code:

         frmForm=CREATEOBJECT('frmformTest')
         frmForm.SHOW

         DEFINE CLASS frmFormTest AS FORM
         VISIBLE=.T.
         WINDOWTYPE=1

         PROCEDURE INIT
         **Comment the following line to see form.
         READ EVENTS
         ENDPROC

         PROCEDURE CLICK
         CLEAR EVENTS
         ENDPROC
         ENDDEFINE

   NOTE: If you issue READ EVENTS in an event or a method of a form, then you
   need to issue CLEAR EVENTS before the form can be closed.

Additional query words: read events clear event form disappear
