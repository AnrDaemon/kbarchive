TITLE   :WWW Service Stops Responding When You Stop Web Site in MMC
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an Out-of-Process (OOP) application stops responding, and you attempt to stop
the Web site by using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), the WWW service
may stop responding.

CAUSE
=====

When OOP applications stops responding, Internet Information Server (IIS)
generates internal schedule requests to clean up its private operating
environment. Because this operation has been scheduled, an attempt to stop IIS
from the MMC may force the service to lock itself so that this request can be
completed.

RESOLUTION
==========

After an OOP application failure, the WWW service can be stopped by issuing a
"net stop w3svc" command without first using the MMC. However, once the WWW
service has been stopped from the MMC, issuing the "net stop w3svc" or "net stop
iisadmin /y" commands will not stop the server. The following errors may
appear:

   No longer accepting requests at this time. Incontrollable state.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Server version 4.0.
