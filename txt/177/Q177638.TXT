SYMPTOMS
========

When upgrading Microsoft Exchange Server from 4.0 or 5.0 to 5.5, you may need to
re-register some DLLs in the Visual Basic references menu.

CAUSE

When Visual Basic is installed on an Exchange Server computer, and the Exchange
version is upgraded to 5.5, some DLLs become unregistered due to version changes
and will require re-registering in Visual Basic.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is no workaround.

STATUS

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem. We are researching this and will
