TITLE   :XFOR: Migrating Data Containing DBCS Characters to Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When migrating data containing double-byte character set (DBCS) characters to
Microsoft Exchange Server, the DBCS characters may be illegible after the
migration is complete. The characters appear correct in the migration files, but
when the message is opened, the characters are not legible.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To migrate data in different languages to Microsoft Exchange Server, run the
Migration Wizard once for each language. It is easiest if the Microsoft Exchange
Server computer that is used to perform the migration uses the same code page as
the language used in the data to be migrated. For example, if migrating Japanese
data, the server should be a Japanese language server. Microsoft Exchange Server
uses the code page for the language that is used for the Microsoft Windows NT
Server software installed on the server.

If the correct code page is not installed on the Microsoft Exchange Server
computer, the import file created during migration can be modified to specify
the correct code page. The following steps detail how to do this:

1. Run the Migration Wizard and perform the first step in a two-step migration
   to create an import file. This will create a .pkl file. Complete step 2
   before running the second part of the migration.

2. Using a text editor, edit the .pkl file to specify the code page for the
   language that you are migrating. For example, if you are migrating Japanese
   data, the following entry for the Japanese code page should be entered at the
   beginning of the import file:

         ! CodePage
         932

3. Complete the migration by running the Migration Wizard and performing the
   second step in the two-step migration.
