TITLE   :Vinca Drivers May Cause Stop 0x24
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Computers running Windows NT Server and the server-mirroring product Vinca
Standby Server version 1.21C may encounter the following blue screen stop
message:

   STOP 0x00000024 (001901f9 f743b5f8 f743b434 8013b59e)
   NTFS_FILE_SYSTEM

NOTE: The stop code will be the same, but the parameters may be different.

CAUSE
=====

A Vinca kernel mode driver intercepts an IRP that was created for a mirrored
device. This will eventually lead to passing a bad destination memory buffer
pointer to the memmove routine.

The link dates for the drivers are:

   801eb000  VncComIP.sys   Fri Jul 18 11:44:41 1997
   80252000   VncDisk.sys   Tue Sep 03 15:57:11 1996

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem is resolved by the Vinca Standby Server version 1.21D release
available for no charge from Vinca.
