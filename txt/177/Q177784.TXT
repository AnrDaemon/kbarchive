PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Add New Hardware wizard to add hardware to your configuration,
you may receive the following error message:

   Setupx.dll caused a general protection fault in module krnl386.exe

When this occurs, the installation of the new hardware stops.

CAUSE
=====

The Setupx.dll file, among other things, builds and maintains the Drvidx.bin
file. The local memory heap may be damaged when this file is generated. This
damage causes the general protection (GP) fault in Krnl386.exe.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 95. This problem no
longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install the current
version of Windows. For information about the current version of Windows, visit
