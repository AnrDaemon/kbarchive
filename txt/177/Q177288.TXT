IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to install the ATI Technologies 3D Rage video driver for
Microsoft Windows 95 in Windows NT, you may receive the following error
message:

   The drivers were not successfully installed. You may not have the
   required privilege to install a new driver.

When you restart Windows NT, you may receive the following error message:

   Atikey32.exe - Entry Point Not Found. The procedure entry point
   SUnMapLS_IP_EBP_8 could not be located in the dynamic link library
   KERNEL32.DLL.

CAUSE
=====

The ATI Technologies 3D Rage video driver for Windows 95 is not compatible with
Windows NT. Even though the ATI driver installation program cannot complete the
video driver installation, an entry is created in the Run key in the registry.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To resolve this problem, use the following steps:

1. Use Registry Editor to delete the AtiKey32 value in the following registry
   key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

2. Restart your computer.
