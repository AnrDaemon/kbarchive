======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the AppWizard to create a CRecordset class using the ODBC Text
Driver, your project will compile. However, when you try to open the recordset,
you will get the following error message:

   Syntax error in FROM clause.

CAUSE
=====

The AppWizard incorrectly parses the table as [Table].[txt], instead of as
[Table#txt].

RESOLUTION
==========

In the CTextDriverSet.cpp implementation file, find the
CTextDriverSet::GetDefaultSQL() function and change the return value from

      return _T("[Table].[txt]");

to the following:

      return _T("[Table#txt]");

Here is the function before the changes:

      CString CTextDriverSet::GetDefaultSQL()
      {
         return _T("[Table].[txt]");

      }

Here is the function after the changes:

      CString CTextDriverSet::GetDefaultSQL()
      {
         return _T("[Table#txt]");
      }

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

The "MDAC 2.5 Stack and Windows File Protection" white paper contains a full list
of the components that are shipped with MDAC 2.5, along with a discussion of
Windows File Protection. Refer to this white paper for more information about
the Jet dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are included in MDAC 2.5, which are
no longer a part of MDAC 2.6.
