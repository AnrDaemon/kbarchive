SUMMARY
=======

If you are unable to start Encarta 98 Encyclopedia for Windows, or if you
experience problems when you attempt to use the enhanced sound or display
features in Encarta, you may need to obtain updated drivers for your sound card
or display card.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Encarta 98 Disc 1 CD-ROM contains a set of registry keys you can use to
determine whether any problems that occur when you use Encarta 98 are related to
outdated sound or display card drivers. To use these registry keys to
troubleshoot problems in Encarta, follow these steps:

1. Insert the Encarta 98 Disc 1 CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive. Press and hold
   down the SHIFT key when you insert the CD-ROM to prevent Encarta 98 from
   starting automatically.

2. Double-click My Computer.

3. Right-click your CD-ROM drive icon, and then click Explore.

4. Double-click the Support folder.

5. Double-click the Sndsoff.reg file, and then click OK.

6. Start Encarta 98.

7. If the problems no longer occur, contact the manufacturer of your sound card
   to inquire about obtaining updated drivers for your sound card. If the
   problems still occur, continue to the next step.

8. Quit Encarta 98.

9. In Windows Explorer, double-click the Sndson.reg file, and then click OK.

10. In Windows Explorer, double-click the Viewoff.reg file, and then click OK.

11. Start Encarta 98.

12. If the problems no longer occur, contact the manufacturer of your display
   card to inquire about obtaining updated drivers for your display card. If
   the problems still occur, continue to the next step.

13. In Windows Explorer, double-click the Sndsoff.reg file, and then click OK.

14. Start Encarta 98.

15. If the problems no longer occur, contact the manufacturer of your sound card
   and the manufacturer of your display card to inquire about obtaining updated
   drivers for your sound card and your display card. If the problems continue
   to occur, they are most likely unrelated to your sound card or display card
   drivers.

To restore the startup sounds, the user interface sounds, and the enhanced
display options in Encarta 98, use the following steps:

1. Double-click My Computer.

2. Right-click your CD-ROM drive icon, and then click Explore.

3. Double-click the Support folder.

4. Double-click the Sndson.reg file, and then click OK.

5. Double-click the Viewon.reg file, and then click OK.
