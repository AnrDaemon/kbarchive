TITLE   :XFOR: Messages with X.400 Address in From Field Not Delivered
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Messages that are received into Microsoft Exchange via the Microsoft Mail
Connector and have X.400 addresses in the From field may contain non- printable
characters and may not be deliverable by other mail systems.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Mail Connector converts incoming messages that contain Escape
Sequences ('//', '$/', and so on) in the DDA.VALUE to non-printable characters
and does not convert them to the proper characters ('/') before passing the
messages into Microsoft Exchange.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================

X.400 addresses that have a DDA.VALUE of a Microsoft Mail address (net/po/alias)
(or any other field that contains a '/' character) will need to Escape the '/'
character with either '$' or '/' if the delimiter between fields is a '/'
character.

These Escaped characters (and the following '/') are converted to a non-
printable character so that they are not mistaken for a delimiter during the
separation process of the address. After this is done, the non- printable
character is replaced with a single '/' because the delimiter has been changed
to a ';'.

An example of this is:

   /c=us/a=mci/p=microsoft/o=pss/dda.type=ms/dda.value=microsoft$/pss$/mail
   box

to

   /c=us/a=mci/p=microsoft/o=pss/dda.type=ms/dda.value=microsoft[171]pss[17
   1]mailbox

to

   c=us;a=mci;p=microsoft;o=pss;dda:ms=microsoft/pss/mailbox
