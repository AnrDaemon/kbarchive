KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows NT, you may receive the following error message:

   At least one service or driver failed during system startup.
   Use Event Viewer to examine the event log for details.

When this occurs, you may see the following error message in the system log in
Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 7000
   Source: Service Control Manager
   Description: Spooler service failed to start due to the following
   error: The system cannot find the file specified.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if either of the following files is missing or damaged:

 - Spoolss.dll

 - Spoolss.exe

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, expand a new copy of the Spoolss.dll and Spoolss.exe
files from your Windows NT CD-ROM to your %SystemRoot%\System32 folder. To do
so, follow these steps:

1. If a Spoolss.dll file or a Spoolss.exe file already exists in the
   %SystemRoot%\System32 folder, rename the file.

2. At a command prompt, change to the <cd-rom>:\<platform> folder,
   where <cd-rom> is your CD-ROM drive and <platform> is the
   computer platform you are using. Use the I386 folder for Intel-based
   computers.

3. To expand the Spoolss.dll file, type the following command:

   "expand spoolss.dl_ %SystemRoot%\system32\spoolss.dll" (without the quotation
   marks)

4. To expand the Spoolss.exe file, type the following command:

   "expand spoolss.ex_ %SystemRoot%\system32\spoolss.exe" (without the quotation
   marks)

5. Type "exit" (without the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

6. Restart your computer.
