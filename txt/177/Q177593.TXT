TITLE   :PRB: Reuse of rdoQuery Object Causes "40006" Unexpected Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual Basic 5.0, when trying to reuse an rdoQuery object by setting a new
SQL statement to the .SQL property without closing the corresponding resultset,
the following error may result:

   Run-time error '40006':
   An unexpected error occurred.

CAUSE
=====

Because the resultset is tied to the rdoQuery object that was used to create it,
the corresponding resultset must be closed before resetting the rdoQuery.SQL
property.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SQL Server and Pubs sample database is used here.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic and choose "Standard EXE." Form1 is
   created by default.

2. From the Project menu, select References, and then place a check next to
   Microsoft Remote Data Object 2.0.

3. Add a CommandButton to Form1, Command1 is created by default.

4. Paste the following code into the code window of Form1:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()

            Dim cn As New rdoConnection
            Dim qd As New rdoQuery
            Dim rs As rdoResultset

            cn.Connect = "Driver={SQL Server};Server=MyServer;UID=sa;PWD=;" _
            & "Database=pubs;"

            cn.EstablishConnection

            Set qd.ActiveConnection = cn

            qd.SQL = "Select title_id, title From Titles"

            Set rs = qd.OpenResultset(rdOpenForwardOnly, rdConcurReadOnly, _
            rdExecDirect)

            Debug.Print rs(0)

            ' *** Uncomment rs.close line to avoid 40006 error
            'rs.Close
            ' ***

            qd.SQL = "Select au_id, au_lname From Authors"
            Set rs = qd.OpenResultset(rdOpenForwardOnly, rdConcurReadOnly)

            Debug.Print rs(0)

         End Sub

5. Note that you must change your Server, UID, and PWD parameters in the connect
   string.

6. Start the program or press the F5 key.
