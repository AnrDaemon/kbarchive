-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows CE, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual C++, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to run an application built with the products listed above results in
the following message:

   '<app-name>' is not a valid Windows CE application.

where <app-name> is the name of the application being run.

CAUSE
=====

The application was not built for the correct processor platform.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can determine what processor is used on a specific device by clicking
[Start|Settings|System|General]. The processor type is displayed in the
"System:" section under the heading "Processor Type:".

To build for a particular processor platform, your Visual C++ project must
contain a configuration for that platform and the configuration must be the
active configuration when you build the application.

 - Use the following steps to select the active configuration:

    - Choose [Build|Set Active Configuration...] from the Microsoft Developer
      Studio menu bar.

    - Select the configuration for the desired processor Platform and click
      [OK].

   If the desired configuration is not present, use the next procedure in this
   article to add one.

 - Use the following steps to create a new configuration:

    - Choose [Build|Configurations...] and click the [Add...] button.

    - Choose the new processor platform in the "Platform:" field.

    - Choose a configuration name and a configuration to copy settings from,
      then click [OK].

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
