SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to send e-mail on MSN, The Microsoft Network, using Microsoft
Outlook 97 as your e-mail client, you may receive the following error message:

   The SMTP server name you specified cannot be found.
   Please check the name and try again.

   SMTP.email.msn.com.

Similarly, when you attempt to receive e-mail on MSN using Outlook 97 as your
e-mail client, you may receive the following error message:

   The POP3 server name you specified cannot be found.
   Please check the name and try again.

   POP3.email.msn.com.

When you click OK, e-mail is sent or received normally.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the MSN e-mail server is very busy, or if you have
established a slow modem connection to MSN.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, increase the server timeout setting to give the MSN
e-mail server additional time to respond. To do so, use the following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Mail or Mail And Fax.

3. In the "The following information services are set up in this profile" box,
   click Internet E-mail, and then click Properties.

4. On the Advanced tab, move the Server Timeouts slider to the right to increase
   the server timeout setting.

   Note: The maximum server timeout setting is 5 minutes.

5. Click OK until you return to Control Panel.

6. Close Control Panel.

Note: If proxy is being used, be sure to verify that the user has WinSock Proxy
Client installed and enabled.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The server timeout setting determines how long Outlook 97 attempts to connect to
the MSN e-mail server before stopping or "timing out." The default server
timeout setting for Outlook 97 is 30 seconds. You may need to increase this
setting if your Internet connection is slow.
