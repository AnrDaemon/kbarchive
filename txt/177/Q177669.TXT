SUMMARY
=======

During the unattended installation process of Windows NT version 4.0, there is
no switch or option to change the Regional Settings of a computer from the
default (U.S.) to UK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following steps outline a method on how to use unattended installation to
configure new computers with UK Regional settings.

NOTE: This article assumes the unattended installation files are stored on a
distribution server in the directory C:\Install.

1. Log on to a new Windows NT 4.0 installation as a new user.

2. Run sysdiff /SNAP 1.txt from an MS-DOS command prompt on this computer. This
   will create a file of the current settings for the computer.

3. Click the Start button, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
   double-click Regional Settings. Click the Regional Settings tab, and then
   select English (United Kingdom).

4. Run the command sysdiff /DIFF 1.txt 2.txt. This will generate a file (2.txt)
   listing all system changes that have been made.

5. From the difference file (2.txt), create a directory structure of changes,
   along with an .inf file and Cmdlines.txt file. To do this, run the following
   command:

   "sysdiff /INF 2.txt C:\INSTALL" (without the quotation marks)

   This will copy the cmdlines.txt file, 2.inf file, and any changed files into a
   $OEM$ directory off the C:\Install directory on the distribution server.

6. Log off and copy the Ntuser.dat file from the Winnt\Profiles\Username
   directory on this computer (for the user profile above) to the distribution
   server. Copy the file to the C:\Temp directory off the $OEM$ directory on the
   distribution server.

   For Example, to C:\Install\$OEM$\C\Temp).

7. Create a batch file named Regupd.bat that copies the Ntuser.dat file from the
   C:\Temp directory to the C:\Winnt\Profiles\Default User directory on any new
   computers. Copy the Regupd.bat file to the $OEM$\C\TEMP directory on the
   distribution server.

8. Add the line 'OemPreinstall = yes' to Unattend.txt.

9. Run WINNT with the desired unattended installation options, plus the /E
   option pointing to the batch file created in Step 2.1.

   For example:

   "WINNT.EXE /U:UNATTEND.TXT /S:C:\INSTALL /E:C:\TEMP\REGUPD.BAT" (without the
   quotation marks)

The Unattended setup will run as normal. It will make changes during the
installation as specified by the OemPreinstall entry and $OEM$ updates. This
will run the Cmdlines.txt and use the created .inf file to update the system.
Then, at the end of the setup, the batch file will run copying the updated
Ntuser.dat over the Default User profile for that computer. This should complete
the setup process and any users logging on to the new computer will
automatically have UK regional settings.
