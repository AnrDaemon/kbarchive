SYMPTOMS
========

Inbound mail from OV/VM (PROFS) to Microsoft Exchange via the Linkage 3.2 OV/VM
connector may back up and the Transfer to Exchange for OV/VM process
(LME-PROFS-MEXIN) may terminate unexpectedly. The Linkage Administrator browse
log may have the following warning/errors logged:

   LME-PROFS-MEXIN    31200   Microsoft Exchange has returned the
                              condition: 80070057
   LME-PROFS-MEXIN    31201   Microsoft Package ID: Win32
   LME-PROFS-MEXIN    31203   Extended NT Information:  The parameter is
                              incorrect.
   LME-PROFS-MEXIN    31042   Cannot save updated (mapped) message
                              addresses: IPM  Content List

This has also occured with the Linkage SNADS Connector.

CAUSE
=====

A Non-Delivery Report (NDR) coming from the OV/VM host contained retired
recipients, the call to resolve the OV/VM recipients failed with and the error
code was incorrectly interpreted as a mail system failure which caused the
process to terminate and the message to be left in the READY-IN queue.


WORKAROUND
==========

Manually delete the message using the Queue Viewer extension of the Linkage
Exchange - Office Vision/VM Connector. The message will be the first in the
Inbound from Connector queue.
