-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The following events may be logged in the Application Event Log:

   Event ID: 12000
   Source: MSExchange NNTP
   Type: Error
   Category: Content Engine

   Description: Error 80040C06-F2000312 occurred while processing
   message <>.

   Event ID: 11201
   Source: MSExchange NNTP
   Type: Error
   Category: Client Action

   Description: An unexpected error occurred while handling an NNTP
   protocol command. Error 0x80040c06 was returned by procedure
   EcWriteStream while executing procedure NNTPCON::EcReadArticle.

CAUSE
=====

A bi-directional pull feed connection has been set up from an upstream server.
When news is pulled down via that server and the articles include the header,
NNTP-Posting-Host, the downstream server tries to post these articles back to
the upstream server. The articles have the NNTP-Posting- Host header so the
upstream server rejects them. The header is tagged onto the articles coming in
to the upstream server when it receives those articles from its source, for
example, a client.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
