TITLE   :XADM: Information Store Does Not Start, Error -1022
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade a computer running Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 to
version 5.5, the Information Store and message transfer agent (MTA) may stop
unexpectedly. Attempting to manually restart the MTA will be successful;
however, the Information Store will be unable to start. The event viewer will
return the following information:

   MSExchangeIS ((120)) System parameter preferred version pages was
   changed from 6528 to 1623 due to physical memory limitation.
   MSExchangeIS ((120)) The database engine 05.1950.0000 started.
   MSExchangeIS ((120)) The database engine is initiating recovery steps.
   MSExchangeIS ((120)) The database engine is replaying log file
   c:\exchsrvr\MDBDATA\edb.log.

CAUSE
=====

The system has run out of disk space during the conversion process, which forces
the conversion process to shut down unexpectedly. Portions of code that allow
the conversion process to think that the Information Store is shutting down
successfully are not being flushed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Free some disk space and restart the Information Store. Restart the upgrade
   process to perform a soft recovery.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem Microsoft Exchange Server version
