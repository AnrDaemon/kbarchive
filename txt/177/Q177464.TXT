TITLE   :XADM: Information Store Stops in EcCreateP1 When Starting MTA
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange information store stops responding when the Microsoft
Exchange message transfer agent (MTA) is started and reports an access
violation. The DRWTSN32 log shows that the stoppage occurred in the function
EcCreateP1.

CAUSE
=====

The function that creates the P1 envelope for the message when delivering to the
MTA (and the gateways) does not check for a null value when the content
identifier property tag exists on a message. This causes the information store
to fault when this condition occurs.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
