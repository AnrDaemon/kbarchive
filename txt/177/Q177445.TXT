TITLE   :Use LoadLibraryEx When Loading Printer Drivers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In specific instances under Windows NT 4.0, certain Hewlett Packard printer
drivers may display a pop-up message that indicates that the print driver is not
installed when it has been installed.

CAUSE
=====

Some of the Hewlett Packard printer driver files statically link to other
printer driver files that are listed as dependent files. The Windows NT spooler
uses a LoadLibrary function call not the LoadLibraryEx function call. This, in
combination with Hewlett Packard's print driver directory not being in the path,
causes the Hewlett Packard driver not to work.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
