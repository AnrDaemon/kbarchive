TITLE   :Error Message: Unable to Save the Registry...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:1.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use System Policy Editor (Poledit.exe) to remotely edit a
computer's registry, you may receive either of the following error messages:

    - Unable to save the Registry: error 1243220 occurred.

    - Unable to save the Registry: error 1243216 occurred.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you are using the wrong .adm file for the registry
you are attempting to remotely edit.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, use the appropriate .adm file for the registry you are
editing. For example, if you are editing a Windows NT 4.0 Workstation registry
from a computer running Windows 95, use the Winnt.adm file instead of the
Windows.adm file.

NOTE: Because of differences in registry formats between Windows 95 and Windows
NT 4.0, you cannot use the Windows.adm file to remotely edit a Windows 95
registry from a computer running Windows NT 4.0. Instead, you must run System
Policy Editor from another computer running Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using the Common.adm and Windows.adm files, Windows 95-based computers can
modify the registry and Config.pol file of other Windows 95-based computers.

Using the Winnt.adm and Common.adm files, Windows NT 4.0-based computers can
modify the registry and Ntconfig.pol file of other Windows NT 4.0- based
computers.
