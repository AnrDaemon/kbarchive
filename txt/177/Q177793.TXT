TITLE   :XADM: NDRs Discarded by Internet Mail Service
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you set up the Internet Mail Service on one computer running Microsoft
Exchange Server as Inbound only and another Exchange Server computer as Outbound
only, you may experience a problem with non-delivery reports (NDRs) being
dropped and not sent to the correct recipient. The administrator for the
Internet Mail Service on the Inbound only server might receive a report from the
Outbound only Exchange server stating:

   Reason: Proxy address not found.

CAUSE
=====

The information store is treating the NDR report destination or name as X.400
instead of as an SMTP one-off and the X.400 address of the receiver of this
report is not listed in the directory. Normally an NDR report gets sent to the
originator of the original message. In this case the originator's address was
converted to X.400 and caused the IMS to fail to send the NDR. The NDR is then
dropped and a problem report is sent to the IMS administrator on the Inbound
Only Exchange server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server 5.0.  This
problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.0 Service Pack 2.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server 5.5.  This
problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1.
