TITLE   :XADM: Store Rejects X.400 Address with Embedded Slashes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5sp1

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

X.400 addresses that contain embedded slashes within a value for an X.400
address are rejected by the Microsoft Exchange information store as an "invalid
postal address" when submitted as a one-off address from a client or when
generated using the X.400 address template on a client. However, the same X.400
address can be replied to successfully when received from an outside originator
or when created as a custom recipient on the Exchange Server computer.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by a problem in the parsing code.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
