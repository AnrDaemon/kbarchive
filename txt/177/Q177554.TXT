PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a

KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp500 kbvfp500a

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The MousePointer property cannot be set to "99-Custom" for any of the form
objects under Traditional Chinese (TC) versions of Visual FoxPro 5.0x. However,
if the form is being designed under the US version of Visual FoxPro 5.0x and the
MousePointer property is set to "99-Custom", the form can be successfully
executed under the Traditional Chinese version of Visual FoxPro.

RESOLUTION
==========

Create the form with the United States (US) version of Visual FoxPro 5.0a and
then move the form to the Traditional Chinese version of Visual FoxPro 5.0a to
add or modify localized components such as captions and labels.

NOTE: If you edit the MousePointer property, then the "99-Custom" setting is no
longer available under the Traditional Chinese version of Visual FoxPro.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior

   running Windows 95 or Windows NT.

2. Create a form and view its MousePointer property.

   NOTE: There is no selection for "99-Custom" in the property list.
