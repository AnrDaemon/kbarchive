SUMMARY
=======

 

SYMPTOMS
========

System Folders, which include Organization Forms, Offline Address Books, and
Schedule+ Free/Busy folders are not secured to the site by default.

In Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5, there is a new property, "Limit administrative
access to home site," on each public folder, which allows the folder to be
secured to the site. This is not checked for system folders.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. Only folders created by users are secured by default.
