Use the following installation order when working with a computer that is using
Insight Manager:

1. Install all required services before installing Insight Manager or a Windows
   NT service pack.

2. Before restarting the computer, apply the latest Windows NT Service Pack. (To
   run a service pack and prevent the computer from rebooting automatically, run
   Update.exe and use the -z switch (for example, "update.exe -z" (without the
   quotation marks).)

3. Before restarting the computer, apply the appropriate SSD from Compaq.

4. Restart the computer.

5. Install Insight Manager from Compaq.

In cases where new services need to be added that were not installed initially,
repeat steps 2-5 to ensure the server has the latest files. See the service pack
Readme file for more information about specific issues that relate to installing
Windows NT service packs.

The Compaq Insight Manager is manufactured by Compaq, a vendor independent of
