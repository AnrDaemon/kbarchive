TITLE   :XADM: ESE97 Keys Not Removed From Registry During Remove All
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

 

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Exchange Server setup and choose Remove All, the
following keys may still exist in the registry:

   HKLM\Software\Microsoft\ESE97
   HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\ESE97\Performance
   HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\ESE97

This is by design. Registry entries pertaining to the ESE97 category will not be
removed, because ESE97 is shared with components other than Exchange.
