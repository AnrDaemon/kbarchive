SYMPTOMS
========

Your Windows NT server is configured such that the WINS client (TCP/IP) is bound
to more than 64 adapter interfaces. When it runs under Windows NT 4.0 with no
service packs applied, the computer will stop responding (hang).

If it runs under Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 3 applied, your computer may
STOP with the following blue screen message:

   STOP 0x0000000A IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL
   (fee3b797,00000002,fee3b797,ff1e82e8)

NOTE: The parameters in the STOP code will be different depending on your
configuration, but the first and third parameters will be the same as each
other.

CAUSE
=====

A worker routine in Netbt.sys returned at a raised IRQL.


RESOLUTION
==========
