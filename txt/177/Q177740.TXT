TITLE   :FIX: Scale Method Results in a Number of Blank Pages Printed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Scale method of the Printer object prints a number of blank pages when the
Scale values are set so that the first Y-coordinate value is greater than the
second Y-coordinate value.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this bug, set Y-coordinate values in the Scale method so the
first Y-coordinate is less than the second Y-coordinate.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Basic 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This section shows you how to reproduce this bug.

NOTE: Set your default printer to print to a file if you want to reproduce this
bug. Sending the output to a printer may result in many blank pages.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Add two CommandButtons to Form1.

3. Copy the following code to the Code window of Form1:

         Option Explicit

         Dim intCounter As Integer

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            Command1.Caption = "Demonstrate the Problem"
            Command2.Caption = "Demonstrate the Expected Behavior"
         End Sub

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
         'This button demonstrates the problem.

            Printer.Scale (0, 250)-(140, 0)  'Y-Coordinate is descending
            Printer.Print " "

            For intCounter = 1 To 100
               Printer.Print "Item #" & intCounter
            Next intCounter

            MsgBox "# Pages : " & Printer.Page

            Printer.EndDoc

         End Sub

         Private Sub Command2_Click()
         'This button demonstrates the expected behavior

            Printer.Scale (0, 0)-(140, 250)  'Y-Coordinate is ascending
            Printer.Print " "

            For intCounter = 1 To 100
               Printer.Print "Item #" & intCounter
            Next intCounter

            MsgBox "# Pages : " & Printer.Page

            Printer.EndDoc

         End Sub

4. Press the F5 key to run the program. Click Expected Behavior to determine how
   many pages are printed. Click Bug Behavior and note that the number of pages
   printed exceed that of the Expected Behavior button.
