SYMPTOMS
========

When using the MFC Database classes or calling ODBC functions within the
DLL_PROCESS_DETACH case of the DllMain() function, an access violation can occur
especially if the DLL links to the MFC DLL (which does a LoadLibrary call to
call ODBC). For example, calling CDatabase::Close() from the destructor of a
global static object in the DLL causes an access violation error in ODBC32.DLL.

CAUSE
=====

Because there are no guarantees of the order by which DLLs receive the
DLL_PROCESS_DETACH case, it is possible that the ODBC handle memory can be freed
before your DLL's DllMain() function gets called with DLL_PROCESS_DETACH.
Therefore, any calls to ODBC using those handles can cause a crash.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not call ODBC functions or use the MFC ODBC classes in destructors of global
objects within DLLs or in the DllMain() DLL_PROCESS_DETACH case.

Instead use a termination function in the DLL which the application can call
before exiting.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
