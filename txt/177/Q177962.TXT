TITLE   :SBS Client Add Pack Cannot Be Reused to Upgrade SBS Licenses
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork sbs

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server Client Add Pack can only be used
once to increase the number of client licenses. If the License Add Pack is used
to bring the server up from a 5 user license to a 10 user license, it will only
bring the server up to 10 user license and cannot be reused to increase the
number of user licenses. The disk can, however, be reused if the server has to
be reinstalled and the number of client licenses needs to be increased to the
original number.



MORE INFORMATION
================

If an attempt is made to reuse the Add Pack (for example, to upgrade from 10
licenses to 15 licenses), the following message will be displayed:

   This Microsoft Small Business Server Client Add Pack disk was already
   used to increase client licenses from 5 to 10. This disk can only be
   reused to restore licenses from 5 to 10 users.

The Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server has a maximum of 25 user licenses.
Furthermore, if a customer buys a pack with 25 licenses or upgrades the server
licenses, using SBS Client Add Packs, to a total of 25 licenses, when he or she
attempts to apply a new SBS Client Add Pack, the customer will receive a message
informing the customer that the maximum number of licenses has been exceeded and
the process will not complete successfully.
