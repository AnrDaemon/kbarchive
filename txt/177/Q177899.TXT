TITLE   :Dependent LU6.2 Bind Rejected with Sense Code 0835
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server 3.0 (including SP1 or SP2) and 4.0 may reject a dependent APPC LU
Bind that is sent by the host. This causes a session activation error and the
following entry is made to the Microsoft Windows NT event log:

   Event: 17
   Description: APPC session activation failure: BIND negative response
   sent
   Sense Data = 083500xx

NOTE: The xx bytes in the sense code point to the hexadecimal offset within the
host bind request of the parameter that SNA Server is rejecting. In this case,
the xx may point to a PLU name which may not be prepended with the network
name.


CAUSE
=====

The host system starts an LU6.2 dependent session by sending a BIND to SNA
Server. If the Primary LU Name (PLU) sent in the BIND request is not preceded by
the network name, then SNA Server fails to properly match against the remote
APPC LU names configured in SNA Server. This causes SNA Server to reject the
BIND if no network name is specified in the PLU name sent by the host system.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, 3.0 SP2, and 4.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server versions 3.0 and 4.0 U.S.
Service Packs. For information on obtaining these Service Packs, query on the
