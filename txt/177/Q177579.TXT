TITLE   :SNA Client Loses One TCP/IP Address on a Multihomed Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0 SP2,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a client connects to a multihomed server with an IP address that is not the
first one, it loses the server's first IP address. For example, a server has two
addresses, 128.207.141.82 and 157.54.165.222. If the client connects to that
server using the second address, the first address is lost and the second
address is duplicated. In effect, the client now has two identical addresses in
its service table.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 SP2 and
4.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
