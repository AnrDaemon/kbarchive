SUMMARY
=======

A status bar control has diagonal lines in the lower right corner, called the
sizing grip, that can be used to resize the window. Occasionally, you will
remove this grip to prevent the user from resizing the window.

For instance, you have removed the WS_THICKFRAME style to prevent the mainframe
window from resizing. If the user moves the sizing grip and resizes the status
bar, painting problems can occur.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can remove the sizing grip by deriving a class from CStatusBar and
overriding PreCreateWindow() to change the styles that are used. Inside of
PreCreateWindow(), you must also remove the SBARS_SIZEGRIP style. For example:

      BOOL CMyStatusbar::PreCreateWindow(CREATESTRUCT& cs)
      {
         // TODO: Modify the Window class or styles here by modifying
         // the CREATESTRUCT cs.

         cs.style &= ~SBARS_SIZEGRIP;

         return CStatusBar::PreCreateWindow(cs);
      }

You can then replace your custom CStatusBar derived class with the default.

For example, if this is the status bar in the main frame window, include the
header file for your CStatusBar derived class in your Mainfrm.h file. Also, in
your Mainfrm.h file, change the declaration of the status bar created in your
Mainfrm.cpp file to use that class.
