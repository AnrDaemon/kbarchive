MORE INFORMATION
================

To work with the Microsoft programs listed at the beginning of this article, a
GPS receiver must meet the following requirements.

 - The receiver must be compliant with NMEA 2.0 or later.

 - The receiver must connect to the serial port in your computer.

   NOTE: The Microsoft programs listed at the beginning of this article cannot
   detect GPS receivers that connect to the PCMCIA slot in your computer.

 - The receiver must not require a specific mapping program to function
   properly.

According to DeLorme, the Tripmate GPS device is compatible only with DeLorme's
Street Atlas USA and AAA Map'n'Go products. The following is an October 1997
quote from the DeLorme site on the World Wide Web:

   Q: Does Tripmate work with non-DeLorme software?

   A: No, even though Tripmate outputs an industry standard protocol, it is
   compatible only with Street Atlas USA 4.0/5.0 and AAA Map'n'Go 2.0/3.0.

Pharos has reported some possible alternative solutions to the compatibility
issues. For assistance with Pharos devices please contact the Pharos technical
support team at:

According to Etak (a division of Sony), the Sony SkyMap serial port receiver only
functions with the SkyMap software. The following is a July 2000 quote from the
Sony SkyMap FAQ page:

   Q: Can the GPS receiver be used with other software packages?

   A: No, the serial port receiver can only be used with SkyMap 2000 software.

   The PCMCIA card receiver can be switched into NMEA-0183 output mode from Etak
   output mode. It may be possible to use this receiver with other software,
   though Etak cannot troubleshoot problems with this configuration.

If you are using the Rand McNally 1225b-h1 on a Windows XP operating system, you
will need to install the GPS device software provided by Rand McNally. The
third-party products discussed in this article are manufactured by vendors
