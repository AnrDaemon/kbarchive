SUMMARY
=======

This article describes VOR functionality in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 and
Microsoft Flight Simulator 98.

The way in which Navaids, and specifically VORs, are received by the aircraft is
somewhat different in Flight Simulator 98 than in earlier versions of Flight
Simulator. In earlier versions of Flight Simulator, all VOR signals could be
received at a fixed distance. The altitude of the aircraft had no effect on the
reception of the VOR.

Because this is not the case in real-life flight, the behavior of the Navaids in
Flight Simulator 2000 and Flight Simulator 98 has changed to reflect each
Navaid's real-life capabilities. As a result, when you are flying in Flight
Simulator 2000 or Flight Simulator 98, your VOR gauges may not receive signals.

As an example, in the Flight Simulator 98 default flight (Meigs Field), you are
unable to receive any VOR or ILS data from O'Hare airport while you are on the
ground at Meigs Field, even if you tune the navigation radios to O'Hare
frequencies. This is because there are too many obstructions on the ground. To
receive Navaid signals, you must take off and climb.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are three types of VORs. They include The following table lists the three
types of VORs, along with their effective altitudes and ranges:

   
   +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | VOR type                 | Altitude           | Range              | 
   +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Terminal VOR (TVOR)      | 1,000' to 12,000'  | 25 Nautical Miles  | 
   +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Low Altitude VOR (LVOR)  | 1,000' to 18,000'  | 40 Nautical Miles  | 
   +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | High Altitude VOR (HVOR) | 1,000' to 14,500'  | 40 Nautical Miles  | 
   +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |                          | 14,500' to 18,000' | 100 Nautical Miles | 
   +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |                          | 18,000' to 45,000' | 130 Nautical Miles | 
   +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |                          | 45,000' to 60,000' | 100 Nautical Miles | 
   +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
