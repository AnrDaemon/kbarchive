======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


After you complete directory synchronization between Microsoft Exchange
Server and Lotus Notes, all the Lotus Notes users are represented on
the Microsoft Exchange Server computer as Custom Recipients.

On the Advanced tab of the properties page for one of the Lotus Notes
Custom Recipients, the option to allow rich text in messages may be
disabled. Toggling this option has no effect. All messages from an Exchange
Server computer to Lotus Notes will maintain their rich-text properties.

This behavior is by product design.
