TITLE   :XADM: BCC Recipient Becomes TO Recipient
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You send a message with a Compuserve Mail recipient on the BCC line. The message
arrives with the Compuserve recipient's name in the To line rather than the BCC
line.

CAUSE
=====

This may occur because of the non-conformity to RFC822. Because the TO and CC
lines are left blank when addressing the message, the header for the message is
considered invalid and the addressee on the BCC line is moved to the TO line to
conform to RFC821.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.0.

This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,

MORE INFORMATION
