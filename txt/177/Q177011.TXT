TITLE   :Generated COBOL Will Not Compile

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 1.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Component Builder (CB) to create a component library (.tlb)
file manually (this is, without using the Import COBOL Wizard), you can define a
method with parameters in an order that prevents COBOL generated by the CB COBOL
Export facility from compiling properly.

If there are two or more parameters that are arrays whose actual counts depend on
the value of other parameters, those actual count parameters must appear before
the first array.

RESOLUTION
==========

The solution to this problem is to use CB to arrange the parameters in the
following order

   COUNT1
   COUNT2
   ARRAY1
   ARRAY2

and then regenerate the COBOL using the COBOL Export facility.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Example
-------

You generate a component library with the following four parameters:

   Count1 (integer)
   Array1 (anything)
   Count2 (integer)
   Array2 (anything)

The generated COBOL would be similar to this:

      01  DFHCOMMAREA.
          05  COUNT1                       PIC S9(4) COMP.         INOUT
          05  ARRAY1 OCCURS 10 TIMES                               INOUT
                         DEPENDING ON COUNT1 OF DFHCOMMAREA
                                               PIC S9(9) COMP.
          05  COUNT2                       PIC S9(4) COMP.         INOUT
          05  ARRAY2 OCCURS 10 TIMES                               INOUT
                         DEPENDING ON COUNT2 OF DFHCOMMAREA
                                               PIC S9(9) COMP.

This COBOL produces the following error message when compiled on MVS:

      115  IGYGR1137-S   "OCCURS DEPENDING ON" object "COUNT2" was defined in
      a variably located area. Execution results will be unpredictable.
