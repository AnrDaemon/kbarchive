-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your network, which is using a Microsoft Windows NT Domain Name Service (DNS)
server, may experience one or more of the following problems:

 - DNS Manager on your DNS server may display some of the zone objects with a
   red X, indicating that they are disabled.

   -or-

 - DNS clients on the network may be unable to resolve reverse name lookups
   successfully.

CAUSE
=====

Your DNS server has its reverse zone, in-addr.arpa, configured as a subdomain of
the root zone (.).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve these issues, reconfigure your DNS server so that the reverse zone,
in-addr.arpa, is a separate zone and not a subdomain of the root zone. Then add
your PTR records or delegations within the in-addr.arpa zone.
