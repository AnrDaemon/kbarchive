SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure SNA Server Manager with more than 250 Local or Remote APPC
LUs, an internal error in MngAgent (Event id: 5137) may be logged in the Windows
NT event log. The entry in the event log indicates that MngAgent was unable to
allocate any more local LUs. In addition, SNA Manager will no longer show proper
status for the configured Local and Remote APPC LUs.

CAUSE
=====

The Manage Agent tables used for memory allocation have a limit of 250 local LUs
and 250 remote LUs per SNA Server service.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, and 3.0 SP2.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
