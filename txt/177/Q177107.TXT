The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

You can provide context-sensitive help for a What's This button on the Title bar
of your form by using the WhatsThisButton property. When this property is set to
True, the mouse pointer changes to the What's This state (arrow with a question
mark) and the topic displayed is identified by the WhatsThisHelpID property of
the control that the user clicks.

This article demonstrates how to display context-sensitive help for the
WhatsThisHelp property by using Help to open a pop-up window provided by Windows
95 Help.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To display context-sensitive help that appears when a user clicks the What's
This button and drops it on an object on your form or report, follow these
steps:

1. Create your Help topics in Microsoft Word or another word processor. For more
   information about creating your topic files in Microsoft Word, please see the
   following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Database

2. Use Microsoft Help Workshop to compile your Help topics.

3. Open the form that contains the objects for which you want to provide What's
   This help information.

4. On the View menu, click Properties to display the form's properties box.

5. In the Form Properties box, change the MinMaxButtons property to None and the
   WhatsThisButton property to Yes.

6. In the HelpFile property, type the name for the Help file that contains your
   Help topics.

   NOTE: Copy this file to your Windows Help folder so that Microsoft Access will
   be able to find it.

7. In the HelpContextID property, type the number that you linked the Help topic
   to in Microsoft Help Workshop.

   NOTE: To display the Help topic in a pop-up window, put a minus sign (-)
   before the number.

8. Repeat step 7 for each control on the form that you want to link to a Help
   topic.

9. Open the form in Form view, click the What's This button, and drag it to one
   of your controls.
