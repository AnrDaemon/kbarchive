TITLE   :FPNW Service Fails to Start
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinfo kbArtTypeINF

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following Drwtsn32 error may appear when restarting a computer running
Windows NT Server and running File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW):

   Instruction at 0x7722D608 referenced memory at 0x003DDEE0 could not be
   read. Exception error in nwssvc.exe.

Instruction address and memory address may be different; however, the exception
should occur in Nwssvc.exe

The FPNW service will also fail to start and cannot be started manually.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may be caused by a corrupt Net$prn.dat file located in the Sysvol
directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To fix the problem, delete or rename the current Net$prn.dat file and restart
the server. When the server restarts, a new Net$prn.dat file will be created.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.51 and
4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
