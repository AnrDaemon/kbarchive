TITLE   :XADM: Memory Leak in Directory Service of Exchange Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When an Exchange Server computer has been running for a long time, it may have a
small memory leak in the directory service component. This can be observed by
using Performance Monitor and checking the private byte counter of the Microsoft
Exchange directory service process (Dsamain.exe). The observed symptom is that
the counter increases over a time frame of days.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange directory service allocates memories from heap, which should be
freed when the task is finished or during shutdown of the directory service.
However, some of the allocated memory is not freed properly.

STATUS
======

version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
