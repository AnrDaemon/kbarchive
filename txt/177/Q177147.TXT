IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT Service Pack 4 includes a new feature that in the System Policy
Editor will allow the administrator to define the default selection for the
prompt displayed to the user in the event a slow network is detected and a
locally cached user profile exists. This fix requires that the service pack be
applied to both the server and client workstation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT 4.0 displays a prompt to the user when a slow network has been
detected asking if the locally cached profile should be used to avoid the amount
of time it may take to download a user profile over a modem connection, for
example. Prior to Service Pack 4, this prompt defaulted to the action of using
the locally cached profile and there was no way to change this default. A new
addition has been made to the template files that create the options available
in the System Policy Editor that allows the administrator to set this default to
download the user profile from the server or to use the locally cached profile.

With the addition of the newest Userenv.dll, the changes can be applied directly
to the registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Add the following value to the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

   Value: SlowLinkProfileDefault
   Type: REG_DWORD
   Value: 0 or 1
