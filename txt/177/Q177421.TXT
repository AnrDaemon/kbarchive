OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDebug kbide kbVC500bug kbVC600fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Visual C++ version 5.0, if the target machine is a Microsoft
Windows NT version 4.0 system, you need to install the file Psapi.dll for remote
debug to work. Please refer to the MORE INFORMATION section below for a complete
list of requirements when starting the remote debug monitor on the target
machine.

This is a requirement for Microsoft Windows NT remote target machines only.

RESOLUTION
==========

Copy the \DevStudio\VC\bin\Psapi.dll file from the Microsoft Visual C++ product
CD-ROM to the \Windows\SYSTEM32 folder of the target machine.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 6.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 installation is supposed to install the
Psapi.dll file in the \SYSTEM32 folder. This DLL is required by the remote debug
monitor. The online document found at the location mentioned in the REFERENCES
section below lists only the following files as required by the remote debug
monitor:

   MSVCMON.EXE, MSVCRT.DLL, TLN0T.DLL, DM.DLL, MSVCP5O.DLL, MSDIS100.DLL

If the Psapi.dll file is missing from the Windows\SYSTEM32 folder, copy this DLL
from the DevStudio\VC\bin folder of the Microsoft Visual C++ product CD-ROM to
this folder.
