-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Microsoft Close Combat: A Bridge Too Far, you may receive the
following error message:

   Cannot create any more DC's.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur for one of the following reasons:

 - You are using an STB Lightspeed display driver with Vision 95 (STB's graphics
   manager).
 - You are using a Hercules Dynamite 128 display driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

You may be able to resolve this issue by reducing the graphics hardware
acceleration. To do so, use the following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. On the Performance tab, click Graphics.

4. Move the Hardware Acceleration slider until it is one notch to the right of
   None (the Basic acceleration setting).

5. Click OK, and then click Close.

6. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.

NOTE: If you receive a "fatal exception" error message when you restart the
computer, or if the computer restarts to a black screen, restart to Safe mode,
and then repeat these steps to move the Hardware Acceleration slider all the way
to the right (the Full acceleration setting).
