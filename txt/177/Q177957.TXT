TITLE   :XFOR: Messages with Non-ANSI Characters Arrive with Garbage
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

E-mail messages arriving through the Internet Mail Service (US English) that
contain non-ANSI characters such as DBCS (Japanese, Korean, and so on) may
arrive with corruption or unusable characters such as squares or boxes in place
of the originally intended characters. This can occur in messages using RTF or
HTML objects as attachments.

CAUSE
=====

The predefined RTF font table is always set to an ANSI character set. This
causes non-ANSI characters to be converted into unusable or garbage characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.0.

This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,

MORE INFORMATION
================

Additional code added to Exchange Server version 5.5 allows an extra font in the
RTF conversion table that eliminates this problem.
