TITLE   :BUG: VBClientExplicitSecurity:ActiveX Component Can't Create Obj
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the VBClientExplicitSecurity tutorial sample, you receive the
following error message:

   Object Creation Failed: ActiveX component can't create object.

CAUSE
=====

The statement

      Set objSecurityContext = CreateObject("Cedar.HostSecurityContext")

specifies the wrong PROGID. The correct PROGID is

      COMTI.HostSecurityContext

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem, perform the following steps:

1. In the Visual Basic (VB) development environment, open the following
   project:

      ~\sna\Comti\Tutorials\CedarBank\VBClientExplicitSecurity
      \CedarBank.vbp

   NOTE: The path and project name should be typed as one line.

2. Select the Form, frmMain (Testbank.frm)

3. On the View menu, click Code.

4. Locate both occurrences of the line

         Set objSecurityContext = CreateObject("Cedar.HostSecurityContext")

   and change each statement to

         Set objSecurityContext = CreateObject("COMTI.HostSecurityContext")

5. On the File menu, click Make, and then select CedarBank.exe from the menu (or
   test by running in VB debug mode).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 4.0. A supported fix
is now available for SNA Server 4.0, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless
you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that
you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
