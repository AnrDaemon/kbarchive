KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your Microsoft Windows NT Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server,
which is configured with one or more Superscopes, may stop responding to DHCP
requests from DHCP Clients with no errors or event log messages indicating that
there is a problem.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

ARTICLE-ID: Q161571
TITLE : Using DHCP "Superscopes" to Serve Multiple Logical Networks

CAUSE
=====

One or more of the child scopes within a Superscope is deactivated. This issue
occurs most commonly when the primary child scope has been deactivated.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you have one or more Superscopes configured and you need to remove a series
of addresses from use, exclude all the addresses within a scope rather than
deactivating the scope.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
