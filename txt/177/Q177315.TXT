======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network version 2.51 
 - Microsoft Outlook Express version 4.0 for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to send e-mail on MSN, The Microsoft Network, using Microsoft
Outlook Express as your e-mail client, you may receive the following error
message:

   Your SMTP server has not responded in 30 seconds. Would you like to
   wait another 30 seconds for the server to respond?

   Account: MSN Mail
   Server: smtp.email.msn.com.

Similarly, when you attempt to receive e-mail on MSN using Outlook Express as
your e-mail client, you may receive the following error message:

   Your POP3 server has not responded in 30 seconds. Would you like to
   wait another 30 seconds for the server to respond?

   Account: MSN Mail
   Server: pop3.email.msn.com.

When you click OK, e-mail is sent or received normally.

NOTE: The account name information and the amount of time specified in the
message may vary depending on your MSN e-mail account settings.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the MSN e-mail server is very busy, or if you have
established a slow modem connection to MSN.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, increase the server timeout setting to give the MSN
e-mail server additional time to respond. To do so, use the following steps:

1. Double-click the Microsoft Outlook Express icon on the desktop. If you are
   prompted to sign in to MSN, click Cancel.

2. On the Tools menu, click Accounts.

3. On the Mail tab, click MSN Mail (if MSN Mail is not listed, click the account
   you use to connect to the MSN e-mail servers), and then click Properties.

4. On the Advanced tab, move the Server Timeouts slider to the right to increase
   the server timeout setting. NOTE: The maximum server timeout setting is 5
   minutes.

5. Click OK, and then click Close.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The server timeout setting determines how long Outlook Express attempts to
connect to the MSN e-mail server before stopping or "timing out." The default
server timeout setting for Outlook Express is 30 seconds. You may need to
increase this setting if your Internet connection is slow.
