======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service Update for Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) Server may log the following
information event message in Event Viewer:

   Event ID   : 20139
   Source     : Router
   Description: The port <port number> has been disconnected due to
                inactivity.

CAUSE
=====

You have a Demand Dial Interface in the Routing and RAS Admin tool configured
for a value other than 0 in Idle seconds before hanging up.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The router service will log the above event each time the connection times out
because the idle seconds have expired. This is normal.

NOTE: Setting Idle seconds before hanging up to 0 disables the timer.
