SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to convert multiple projects created with Microsoft
Visual C++ version 4.x into Microsoft Visual C++ version 5.0 or version 6.0
projects. If you are converting projects from earlier versions of Microsoft
Visual C++ (versions 2.2 or earlier), replace files of extension .MDP with .MAK
in the following instructions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To convert a single project, select "Open Workspace" from the File menu and
select the project you wish to convert (the project has a .MDP extension). This
method can be tedious if you have a large number of projects to convert. The
following steps can help streamline this process.

1. Use the Microsoft Windows Explorer to find all files with a .MDP extension.
   This list contains the entire list of Microsoft Visual C++ version 4.x
   projects. Select a parent folder (this could be the root of a drive). From
   the Tools menu, select Find, then "Files or Folders." The Find dialog box is
   displayed with the proper drive and folder selected. In the "Named" field,
   enter *.MDP. Click the "Find Now" button.

2. Press SHIFT+click and CTRL+click to select the projects you wish to convert.

3. Drag and drop this list of files into Microsoft Developer Studio. If
   Microsoft Developer Studio is minimized, while you are dragging, hold the
   mouse cursor over the button for Microsoft Developer Studio on the System
   Tray and wait for Microsoft Developer Studio to be activated. Then drop the
   list in Microsoft Developer Studio.

4. At this point, you are prompted several times for each project. Read each
   dialog box carefully.

This method converts each project separately. That is, use of this procedure does
not result in a single workspace with all of the converted projects.
