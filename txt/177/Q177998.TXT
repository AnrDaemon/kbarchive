TITLE   :XFOR: IMAP/POP3 Clients Cannot Reply to Migrated Messages
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After the Exchange Migration Wizard is used to migrate mailboxes and messages
from Microsoft Mail, Collabra Share, CCMail, Groupwise, or any other supported
messaging system, IMAP and POP3 clients will not be able to reply to the
original senders of the messages.

CAUSE
=====

When messages are migrated from another messaging system to Exchange, the
properties of the original messages are left intact. This includes the address
of the sender. For example, if a user migrates a message from a Microsoft Mail
mailbox into Exchange and replies to the message with the Microsoft Outlook
client, the 10/10/10 MSMail address will be the only option.

IMAP and POP3 clients can only send to SMTP addresses. Because the original
message never contained an SMTP address, only the display name of the message
originator will be present. The IMAP or POP3 users will need to update their
personal address book with the SMTP address of the message originator to enable
message replies. If this originator does not have an SMTP address, message
replies will only be possible with the Microsoft Exchange or Outlook client.

This behavior is by product design.

WORKAROUND
==========

Typing the correct SMTP address for the original sender will allow the IMAP/POP3
client to reply.
