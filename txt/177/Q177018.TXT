SUMMARY
=======

Schedule+ meeting requests sent over the Internet Mail Service require that Rich
Text Format (RTF) is enabled for the custom recipient address. The recipient
must be able to recognize RTF and Schedule+ properties. If RTF is not enabled,
the recipient will receive a plain text version of the meeting request message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With RTF disabled, the message is sent as Content-Type: text/plain, which is
plain text. With RTF enabled, the message is sent as Content-Type:
multipart/mixed, which includes the formatting to display the proper forms for
Schedule+.

This is by product design


Additional query words: Schedplus smtp Schedule Plus
