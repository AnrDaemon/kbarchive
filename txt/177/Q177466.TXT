TITLE   :SMS: NNP Stays on Windows 95 Taskbar After Login
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbPGC smspgc

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After a Windows 95 client logs on to a domain and runs the Smsls.bat file, the
Network Naming Provider (NNP) application may appear on the taskbar and Program
Group Control (PGC) may appear to stop responding. The NNP application can be
manually closed and may allow PGC to continue. This usually occurs when the
client is started, although it may also occur if the client is logged off and
back on.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem may occur if the Desktop Applications Director (DAD) toolbar from
Perfect Office is loaded. Verify whether this application exists in the client's
Startup Group. Running DAD manually may also cause the NNP application to appear
on the taskbar.

To workaround the problem, remove the Desktop Applications Director from the
Startup Group.
