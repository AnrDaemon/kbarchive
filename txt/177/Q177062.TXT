======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The error "Update Conflict" appears when deleting, editing, or inserting records
in a remote view if the key field chosen in the Update Criteria tab is not a
unique field.

CAUSE
=====

If FoxPro finds duplicate keys in the local buffer of the table, it generates
this error. FoxPro uses the key field to uniquely identify the correct record to
delete or edit. If FoxPro did not identify the record, it could delete or edit
the wrong records.

RESOLUTION
==========

Here are two workarounds for this problem:

 - Design the tables with a unique key field and mark the field as the key field
   in the Update Criteria tab of the view designer.

   -or-

 - If creating a unique key field is impossible, select multiple fields to be
   the keys in the Update Criteria tab. If these fields combine to make a unique
   key, update conflicts will not occur because FoxPro can uniquely identify the
   record.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
