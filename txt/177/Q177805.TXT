The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 97, version 8.03, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the Microsoft Outlook client on a Microsoft Exchange Server
computer, you may receive the following error:

   Setup cannot register COMCAT.dll in the system registry
   because an older version is in use. Close all applications
   and try again.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange Event Service that uses the Comcat.dll file may be
running. This behavior is by design.

RESOLUTION
==========

Stop the Microsoft Exchange Event service in the Control Panel Services icon
before starting or continuing with the Outlook installation.
