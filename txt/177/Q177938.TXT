TITLE   :XADM: Using AT Command for Command-Line Import/Export
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use the AT command for command-line directory import or
export with Admin.exe, the process may not complete.

When the AT command fails to complete the import of a batch file, the following
event is generated in the Event Viewer Application log:

   Event ID 181
   Description:
   Could not bind to the Microsoft Exchange Server <name of server>.
   You do not have the permissions required to complete the operation.

CAUSE
=====

The Schedule service startup value is set to use a System account.

WORKAROUND
==========

To fully utilize the AT command, modify the Schedule service Startup property in
the Control Panel Services icon to use "This Account." Use an account that has
at least the Permissions Admin role on the Exchange site you are attempting to
manipulate.

To ensure that you will have full functionality using command-line import and
export with the AT command, specify the Exchange Service Account as the Log On
As account for the Schedule service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Directory import/export can be run from the command-line using Admin.exe.
Therefore, it can be run as part of a batch process using the AT command. For
more information on running import/export from the command line, please refer to
the Microsoft Exchange Administrator's Guide, pages 479-487.
