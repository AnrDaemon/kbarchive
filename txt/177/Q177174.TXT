TITLE   :WINS Server Displays Owners with Questions Marks
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you examine the mappings in your Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)
Server database, you may see entries with question marks (\\???) for the
computer name in the Select Owner dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

The entries that are appearing as \\??? are WINS servers that are replicating
with your WINS server. However, these replication partners are not listed in the
WINS Manager in the WINS Servers list.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following steps:

1. In WINS Manager, click Server and click Add WINS Server.

2. Type the IP address or the NetBIOS name of the WINS server that is displaying
   with question marks in the mappings and click OK.

3. Click Mappings and click Show Database to verify that the replication partner
   is now displaying either its IP address or computer name instead of question
   marks.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5, 3.51,
and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
