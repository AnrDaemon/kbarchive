SUMMARY
=======

Your computer may have an audio device named Game Compatible listed in the
Multimedia tool in Control Panel. This is an audio device installed by some
voice-capable modems. This device is listed in the Multimedia tool in the
Preferred Device list.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Certain modems install a Wave Device For Modem device that appears in Device
Manager. With this driver, wave input/output (I/O) data is sent through the PC's
communications (COM) port to the modem. This serial wave driver supports IMA
ADPCM and Rockwell ADPCM formats, as well as 8 kHz, mono, and 16-bit PCM format
wave data. Some drivers may also support 11.025 kHz, 22.05 kHz and 44.1 kHz,
mono, and 8- and 16-bit PCM format wave data. This is separate from, but similar
to, the usual Sound wave I/O device used by most Windows-based games.

The Game Compatible audio playback device is a component of this driver.


The Wave Device For Modem device may also include other components, such as:

 - Voice Modem Wave #00 Handset
 - Voice Modem Wave #00 Line

The exact components names may vary from modem to modem.

Audio tab in Multimedia properties, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, double-click Control Panel, and then
   double-click Multimedia.

2. Click the Advanced or Devices tab, double-click the Audio Devices branch to
   expand it, and then double-click the installed modem wave device.

3. Click "Use audio features on this device."
