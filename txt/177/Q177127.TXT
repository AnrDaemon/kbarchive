TITLE   :Incorrect Report on Disk Free Space Under Dfs
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0,4.01;Windows:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

The Disk Free Space reported in Windows Explorer or in a Command Prompt on a
Distributed File System (Dfs) client for a Dfs share is always the Disk Free
Space of the drive containing (hosting) the Dfs root.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To reproduce this behavior:

1. Host a Dfs root on a Windows NT Server (Dfs 4.0/4.1).

2. Create a volume that references a remote server.

3. From a Dfs-aware client, map a drive to the Dfs volume created in step two.

4. Check the properties of the mapped drive.

5. The amount of disk free space reported is for the drive on the server hosting
   the Dfs root, not the remote server's drive to which the connection was
   actually made.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
