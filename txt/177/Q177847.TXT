SYMPTOMS

When you double-click Add New Hardware in Control Panel, you may receive the
following error message:

   Rundll32 caused a General Protection Fault in module Setupx.dll.

CAUSE
=====

You may receive this error message if there is a damaged .inf file in the

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, find and delete the damaged .inf file in the Windows\Inf
folder. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Verify that you can view hidden and system files.

For additional information about how to do this, click the article number below
to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q141276 How to View System and Hidden Files in Windows

2. Determine the date of your original Windows system files. To do so, follow
   these steps:

   a. Click Start, point to Find, and then click "Files Or Folders".

   b. In the Named box, type "win.com" (without the quotation marks), and then
      click "Find Now".

   c. Right-click the Win.com file in your Windows folder, and then click
      Properties.

   d. Note the date on the Modified line. This is the date of your original
      Windows system files.

3. Click Start, point to Find, and then click "Files Or Folders".

4. In the Named box, type "inf" (without the quotation marks), and then click
   Find Now.

5. Double-click the Inf folder.

6. Move all of the .inf files that do not have the same date as your original
   Windows system files into a new folder. For information about how to create a
   new folder, click Start, click Help, click the Index tab, type "creating
   folders" (without the quotation marks), and then click Display. For
   information about how to move files, click Start, click Help, click the Index
   tab, type "moving files" (without the quotation marks), and then click
   Display.

7. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

8. Double-click Add New Hardware, and follow the instructions on the screen. If
   you do not receive the error message, skip to step 10.

9. If you receive the error message when you run the Add New Hardware wizard,
   move the .inf files back into the Inf folder, and then reinstall Windows 95.

10. If you do not receive the error message when you run the Add New Hardware
   wizard, the damaged .inf file is one of the files you moved in step 6. To
   identify the damaged .inf file, move the .inf files back into the Inf folder
   one at a time (noting the name of the .inf file you are moving), and then
   repeat steps 7-8. Repeat this process until you receive the error message
   again. When you receive the error message again, the last .inf file you
   moved is the damaged .inf file. To determine where this file originated,
   double-click the file and note any manufacturer, version, or date
   information that may indicate the origin of the file. After you determine
   the origin of the file, delete the file, and then reinstall it from the
   original installation disks or CD-ROM.
