TITLE   :XCLN: NIW Required to Customize Outlook Client Install Point
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::8.03
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 97, version 8.03 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Outlook 8.03 Release Notes (Olreadme.rtf) shipped with Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.5, contain the following section regarding the use of
the 32-bit Setup Editor program:

   1.6 Modifying Microsoft Outlook Installation Point

   When using Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 in a 32-bit
   environment, do not use the 16-bit Setup editor (Stfedt16.exe) supplied on
   the Microsoft Outlook compact disc to modify the Microsoft Outlook
   installation point. Instead, use the 32-bit Setup editor, Stfedtr.exe, which
   is also available on the Microsoft Outlook compact disc.

You will receive the following error message when you attempt to run Stfedtr.exe
on a 32-bit Microsoft Outlook installation point:

   The directory does not contain a valid Microsoft Outlook
   Client Installation. Could not find file EXCHNG.STF.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. The 32-bit Setup Editor program is not designed to
run on any installation point of Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft Outlook.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, run the Network Installation Wizard (NIW) on a
32-bit Microsoft Outlook installation point. The NIW is included in the
"Microsoft Office 97 Resource Kit." The latest version is available on the
following Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/office/ork/

After you download and install the NIW, perform the following steps to customize
the Microsoft Outlook installation point:

1. From the Outlook.w32 directory on the Microsoft Exchange 5.5 Client Pack CD,
   run SETUP /A to create an installation point of Microsoft Outlook.

2. Start the Network Installation Wizard.

3. When you are prompted, choose the Setup.lst file that is located in the
   installation point directory that you created in Step 1.

4. Complete the remaining steps of the NIW to customize the client installation
   point to meet the needs of your organization.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you attempt to change the name of the Outlook.stf file to Exchng.stf and then
run the Setup Editor on the renamed file, an application error may occur and you
receive one of the following messages:

   The instruction at "0x0041d04f" referenced memory at "0x00000000".
   The memory could not be "read".

   -or-

   STFEDTR.EXE has caused an exception access violation.
