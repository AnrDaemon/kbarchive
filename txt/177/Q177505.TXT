SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to configure Microsoft Personalization Server to work
on Internet Information Server version 4.0 using Anonymous authentication.
Anonymous logins are common when accessing the Web. Web administrators will want
to enable anonymous login capabilities when their Web sites are being accessed
by Internet users.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. In the Microsoft Management Console, select Default Web Site, and then click
   Properties on the context menu.

2. Click the Directory Security tab, and then click the Edit button for
   Anonymous Access and Authentication Control.

3. Click the Edit button on the Authentication Methods tab. This will bring up
   the Anonymous User Account dialog box, which contains the Enable Automatic
   Password Synchronization checkbox and an Edit box to change the password.

4. Add a password, then close Anonymous User Account dialog box and enter the
   same password for the account in the Windows NT User Manager for Domains.

5. If the files are stored on a different computer than the Web server, do one
   of the following:

    - Enable the guest account on the file server

    - Create an account on the file server with the same name and password as
      the anonymous account used by the Web server.

   In either case, you must make sure that the account has access to the share on
   which the propdb files are stored.
