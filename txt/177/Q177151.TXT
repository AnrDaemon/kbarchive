PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You are unable to integrate functionality between Microsoft FrontPage 97 and
Microsoft Visual Source Safe on the Microsoft Personal Web Server for Windows
95.

CAUSE
=====

The integration between FrontPage and Visual Source Safe on Microsoft Internet
Information Server (IIS), Microsoft Windows NT Workstation Peer Web Services, or
Microsoft Personal Web Server for Windows 95 requires functionality that is only
present in the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM).

This capability was introduced in Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Workstation and
Server. It was not originally part of Windows 95. Therefore, FrontPage cannot be
integrated with Visual Source Safe on the Microsoft Personal Web Server for
Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

To integrate Microsoft FrontPage and Microsoft Visual SourceSafe on the
Microsoft Personal Web Server for Windows 95, obtain and install the DCOM update
for Windows 95. You can obtain the DCOM update for Windows 95 by connecting to
the following Microsoft World Wide Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/com/dcom/dcom1_2/dcom1_2.asp

NOTE: The DCOM update is also installed if you install Microsoft Internet
Explorer 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft FrontPage 97 does not support DCOM because it was developed after
FrontPage 97 was released. FrontPage 97 was not tested with DCOM and it is not
supported running under it. FrontPage 98 was developed after the introduction of
DCOM and was tested with it and is supported with DCOM.
