SUMMARY
=======

In a mail merge main document, you can use an IF (IF...THEN...ELSE) conditional
statement to check whether one condition or multiple conditions are met.

This article provides a method of nesting COMPARE statements in an IF field to
test whether the desired conditions are met.

field, click the article numbers below to view the articles in the Microsoft

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can specify multiple conditions by nesting a COMPARE field inside an IF
field.

NOTE: To type field brackets ( { } ) in a Word document, press CTRL+F9. To turn
field codes on and off, press ALT+F9.

To Test Whether Multiple Conditions Are Met
-------------------------------------------

To test whether multiple fields meet certain conditions, you can use an AND
conditional statement in your mail merge main document similar to the
following:

   { IF { = AND ( { COMPARE { MERGEFIELD Field_1 } = "Value" }, { COMPARE {
   MERGEFIELD Field_2 } = "Value" } ) } = 1 "True Instructions" "False
   Instructions" }

The result of these nested COMPARE statements would be the "True Instructions"
when both Field_1 and Field_2 are equal to "Value"; otherwise, the "False
Instructions" would be given as the result.

NOTES:

 - When all of the conditions of the AND statement are met, the value returned
   by the statement would be equal to 1 (this would result in the True
   Instructions being returned).

 - When all of the conditions of the AND statement are not met, the value
   returned by the statement would be equal to 0 (this would result in the False
   Instructions being returned).

To Test Whether One Condition Is Met
------------------------------------

To test whether one of the fields meets a particular condition, you could use an
OR conditional statement in your mail merge main document similar to the
following:

   { IF { = OR ( { COMPARE { MERGEFIELD Field_1 } >= "Value" }, { COMPARE {
   MERGEFIELD Field_2 } >= "Value" } ) } = 1 "True Instructions" "False
   Instructions" }

The result of these nested COMPARE statements would be the "True Instructions"
when either Field_1 or Field_2 is equal to "Value"; otherwise, the "False
Instructions" would be given as the result.

NOTES:

 - When any of the conditions of the OR statement is met, the value returned by
   the statement would be equal to 1 (this would result in the True Instructions
   being returned).

 - When all of the conditions of the OR statement are not met, the value
   returned by the statement would be equal to 0 (this would result in the False
   Instructions being returned).

For more information about conditional statements, click the Office Assistant,
type "advanced mail merge" (without the quotation marks), click Search, and then
