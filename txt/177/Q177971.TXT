SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a macro that was converted from WordBasic to Microsoft Visual Basic
for Applications, you receive the following error message:

   Type Mismatch Error

CAUSE
=====

If you converted a WordBasic macro that contains statements similar to the
following:

      x = Val(FontSize())

the converted code may appear as:

      x = WordBasic.Val(WordBasic.FontSize())

This converted statement causes the macro to halt with the "Type Mismatch" error
message.

Convert the statement to the Visual Basic equivalent:

      x = Selection.Font.Size
