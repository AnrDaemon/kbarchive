IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to delete an MS Mail postoffice connection in the Connections
tab of the MS Mail Connector property page, you may receive the following error
message:

   The postoffice <Network>/<Postoffice> could not be deleted
   because
   either the MS Mail Connector server is unavailable or there is
   insufficient memory available to perform this operation.

CAUSE
=====

The above error can occur if the registry value
<Network>/<Postoffice> is missing under the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMSMI\ 
   Parameters\Admin

(<Network>/<Postoffice> is the network and postoffice name for the MS
Mail postoffice to be deleted.)

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys and
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

Manually add the following registry value under the above registry key and then
delete the postoffice connection.

The value is:

   Value Name: <Network>/<Postoffice>
   Data Type: REG_SZ
   String: <the UNC path to the postoffice to be deleted> /Z

For example:

   Value name: Microsoft/Redmond
   Data Type: REG_SZ
   String: \\mailserver\maildata /Z
