TITLE   :XADM: Cannot Find Exchange Server Recipients Using LDAP Queries
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When searching for Exchange Server recipients and custom recipients using LDAP
clients such as Internet Mail or Outlook Express, the results which are returned
may not accurately reflect the contents of the global address list.

CAUSE
=====

This can occur because the search string is being compared to fields in the
properties of the Exchange recipients which may not have similar information.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, populate the First and Last name fields of Exchange
recipients or custom recipients. LDAP searches will not compare against a
recipient's Display name.

For additional information about correcting the problem for Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks (MS Mail PC) custom recipients, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q148500 Creating First/Last Names for MS Mail Custom Recipients

MORE INFORMATION
================

When LDAP searches are done using Microsoft Internet Mail and Outlook Express,
an initial string search is performed.

When data is entered in the Name field of an LDAP search, this data is compared
against the First Name, Last Name, Directory Name, and SMTP e-mail address of
the recipients in the Exchange Server global address list.
