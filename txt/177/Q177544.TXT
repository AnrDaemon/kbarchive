TITLE   :XFOR: Fixed Length File Sent from OV/VM Using SENDFILE Corrupted
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - LinkAge Message Exchange, version 3.2 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A fixed-format CMS file, which is uploaded to the host (not by the Linkage
Connector) and then sent to a Microsoft Exchange user as an attachment using
SENDMAIL via the Linkage OV/VM connector, is corrupted and unreadable by the
Exchange user.

CAUSE
=====

The length in bytes of the file was incorrectly being placed in the file being
sent to the Exchange user. This was causing the OV/VM to Exchange transformation
to render the file attachment unreadable.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Linkage Message Exchange,
version 3.2.
