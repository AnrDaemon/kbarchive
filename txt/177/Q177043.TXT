SUMMARY
=======

You may be unable to complete the River Outpost campaign in the Ascent Of Egypt
learning campaign. This campaign can be completed successfully by following the
steps listed below. The hint provided for this campaign may be somewhat
confusing. The hint mentions researching Watch Towers, but to meet the victory
conditions, you must build Guard Towers. Guard Towers can be built only after
you advance to the Iron Age.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In order to complete the River Outpost campaign, you must meet the following
three conditions:

 - Secure the Island
 - Build a Town Center
 - Build two Guard Towers

Once you have secured the Island, you can build a Town Center. You can build two
Watch Towers before you advance to the Iron Age. However, to build a Guard
Tower, you must have enough Food and Gold to advance to the Iron Age. In the
Iron Age, you can conduct the research at the Granary that is necessary to
upgrade the Watch Towers to Guard Towers.
