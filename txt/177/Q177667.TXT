TITLE   :Unable to Transfer Large Files with NICs Using DEC-chipset
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

It has been observed in several cases that on very fast computers (for example,
Digital Equipment AlphaServer 1000 5 /333 or AlphaServer 1000 5 /333), there are
problems transferring larger files if network adapters with DEC-Chipset (for
example, Digital Equipment DE435 PCI Ethernet Adapter or DE450-CA Etherworks
Turbo) are used.

CAUSE
=====

This is because of a large amount of collisions occurring during file transfers.
In general, the problem is protocol independent but will most likely be observed
in TCP/IP environments. The problem may also happen on Intel-based computers.

RESOLUTION
==========

Download the most recent drivers V2.60 or higher, from Digital's Web site.
