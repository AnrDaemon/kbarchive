TITLE   :NET USE to a NetWare resource with CSNW / GSNW i
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This information applies to a computer running Windows NT Workstation with
Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) installed and to a computer running Windows
NT Server with Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW) installed.

When using a NET USE command to connect to a NetWare resource, the time it takes
to connect is notably longer than when using NET USE to connect to a Microsoft
resource.

CAUSE
=====

In Windows NT 3.51, the network provider search order is controlled by options
set using the Networks button in the Network tool of Control Panel. In Windows
NT 4.0, it is controlled by using the Network Access Order button found on the
Services tab of the Network tool in Control Panel. These buttons are unavailable
unless CSNW or GSNW are installed. If the Network Access order has Microsoft
Windows Network listed as the highest priority under Network Providers, the
delay in connecting to NetWare resources will occur.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With both the Microsoft and NetWare (CSNW/GSNW) redirectors installed and with
Microsoft networks having priority, Windows NT will attempt to resolve any
machine name specified with NET USE through whatever NetBIOS name resolution
methods available. These methods can include NetBIOS broadcast for NetBEUI and
NWLink, and a multitude of methods for TCP/IP, including NetBIOS name cache,
WINS, b-node broadcast, LMHOSTS file, HOSTS file, and DNS. Only after these
methods fail will the NET USE command be passed from the Microsoft redirector to
the NetWare redirector. After the NetWare redirector receives the command, name
resolution is very quick through a SAP query.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, change the network provider access order such that the
NetWare or Compatible Network is highest on the list. With this change, all NET
USE commands will be passed first to the NetWare redirector for name resolution.
This change may also be better for situations where File Manager or Explorer is
used more often than NET USE. However, this change is not desirable in many
cases.

An alternate syntax for the NET USE command exists that is invalid for use with
Microsoft resources but is valid for use with CSNW or GSNW. Use of this syntax
will cause the Microsoft redirector to instantly pass the command to the NetWare
redirector. The following standard command is valid for Microsoft or NetWare
resources:

" NET USE X: \\SERVER\RESOURCE " (without the quotation marks)

Where X: is the desired drive letter to use (or * for the next available drive
letter), SERVER is the name of the Microsoft or NetWare server, and RESOURCE is
the Microsoft share or NetWare volume.

For faster results when connecting to a NetWare resource, use the following
syntax:

" NET USE X: SERVER\RESOURCE: " (without the quotation marks)

Where X: (or *) is the drive letter to use, SERVER is the name of the NetWare
server, and RESOURCE: is the name of the NetWare volume. This syntax will be
rejected by the Microsoft redirector and passed directly to the NetWare
redirector. The command will complete much more quickly, reducing both the time
to connect and network traffic generated to complete the command.
