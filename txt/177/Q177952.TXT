KEYWORDS:kbusage aoe kbSysSettings

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Age of Empires, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are playing a multiplayer game, you may see a turtle, or a yellow or
red dot, next to a player's name in the Scores window.

CAUSE
=====

If the frame rate (the number of frames per second of video images on the
screen) drops below 15 frames per second, a turtle appears beside the name of
the player with the slowest computer. If the network latency (the time it takes
for a packet of data to travel between two computers) is from 300 milliseconds
to 1 second, a yellow dot appears beside the name of the player with the slowest
Internet connection. If the network latency is greater than 1 second, a red dot
appears beside the name of the player with the slowest Internet connection.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following information may help you improve the performance of a multiplayer
game.

 - The fewer players in the game, the faster the game runs. For example, game
   performance is slower in an 8-player game than in a 2-player game.

 - The player with the fastest computer should be the host, even if there are no
   computer players participating in the game (the host computer is responsible
   for running the computer players). The host computer is required to do extra
   work during the game.

 - When you play a multiplayer game over the Internet using a Dial-Up Networking
   connection, we do not recommend adding computer players to the game if more
   than three human players are already playing. If you have a low bandwidth
   (the amount of information that can be passed at any given moment), computer
   players can have an adverse effect on game performance.

 - Multiplayer games run only as fast as the slowest computer in the game. To
   see which players are experiencing network latency or frame rate problems,
   click the S button in the lower-right corner of the game screen to display
   the player scores as well as the following information:

   If a turtle appears beside the name of a player, that player has the slowest
   system. The player can try to improve performance by following the tips
   provided in this article, or the player can drop out of the game.

   If a red or yellow dot appears beside the name of a player, indicating network
   latency problems, the player can reestablish their Internet connection and
   restart the game to attempt to improve performance.

 - When you run other network programs when you play Age of Empires, you
   increase network latency, which can reduce game performance. For additional
   information about how to reduce network latency and improve multiplayer game
   performance, please click the article number below to view the article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q232392 Gaming Zone: High Latency in Game Lobbies or When Playing Games

 - If you play a multiplayer game with eight players, game performance is best
   when each player's computer meets the Age of Empires minimum system
   requirements of a Pentium 90 processor and 24 megabytes (MB) of RAM. The game
   host should have the most powerful computer and the most RAM.
