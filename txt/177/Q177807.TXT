TITLE   :XADM: Online Backup of the Store or Directory May Stop
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5sp1

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Any backup program that uses the Microsoft Exchange Backup Extensions to perform
an online backup of the information store or the directory may stop responding
with an Access Violation into Dr. Watson.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Backup Extensions are looking for available TCP/IP Socket addresses
to perform the backup. This seems to only happen on a local backup. Remote
backups of the information store or the directory are successful.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, back up the information store and the directory
from a remote location.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the Post-SP2 fix for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
