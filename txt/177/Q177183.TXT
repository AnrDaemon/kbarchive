TITLE   :Unable to Add Components from Corporate Evaluation CD-ROM
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to add additional components or services to an existing
installation of Windows NT Workstation, you may receive the following prompt:

   Please insert the disk labeled: 'Windows NT Workstation CD-ROM'
   into <drive>:

You may receive this prompt even though your CD-ROM drive is working properly,
the appropriate Corporate Desktop Evaluation 97 CD-ROM is in the drive, and you
have properly specified the folder containing the Windows NT installation files.

CAUSE
=====

When you add new components or services, the volume label of the CD-ROM is
checked to ensure that the proper CD-ROM is in the drive. The volume label of
the Corporate Desktop Evaluation 97 CD-ROM is EVALSYS instead of the retail
volume label of NTWKS40a. For this reason, the Corporate Desktop Evaluation 97
CD-ROM is not recognized as a valid Windows NT Workstation CD-ROM.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Copy the I386 folder from the appropriate Corporate Desktop Evaluation 97
   CD-ROM to your hard disk.

   NOTE: On some Corporate Desktop Evaluation 97 CD-ROMs, the Windows NT
   Workstation installation files may be located in the Winntw folder instead of
   the I386 folder.

2. Add the components or services to your Windows NT Workstation installation.

3. When you are prompted, type the location of the Windows NT installation files
   on your hard disk.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that this behavior does not occur if you access the Corporate Desktop
Evaluation 97 CD-ROM from a network share or if you copy the Windows NT
Workstation installation files from the Corporate Desktop Evaluation 97 CD-ROM
to your hard disk.

The Corporate Desktop Evaluation 97 CD-ROM contains the following programs:

 - Microsoft Office 97

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97

 - Microsoft Team Manager 97

 - Microsoft Project for Windows 95

 - Microsoft Windows 95

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0

 - Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0

These products are full versions with trial licenses. These products are disabled
when the trial license period expires. For additional information, see the
documentation included with the Corporate Desktop Evaluation 97 package.
