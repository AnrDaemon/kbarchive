The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Dial-Up Networking (DUN) client connects to a 40-bit or 128-bit Routing
and Remote Access Server that is configured to "Require Data Encryption" or
"Require Strong Data Encryption", the client is not disconnected if the selected
data encryption negotiation fails to converge.

The following error may be logged in Event Viewer in the System Log on the server
after the client has successfully established its connection:

   Event ID   : 20073
   Source     : Router
   Description: The following error occurred in the %protocol_name% module
                on port %port_name%. The PPP control protocol for this
                network protocol is not available on the server.

NOTE: This error may also be logged after the installation of the Routing and
Remote Access Service Hotfix Update 1.0 if "Require Strong Data Encryption" is
enabled.

==========
