TITLE   :Location of CedarBank Recording File Is Misleading

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The instructions for locating a recording file to run the CedarBank sample in
playback mode are misleading. They state that the recording file is in the
directory where the CedarBank sample code is installed. Actually, there are two
recording files shipped with Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator (COMTI). One
file is in the ~\sna\Comti\Tutorials\CedarBank\CICSLink subdirectory for CICS
LINK playback testing and the other is in the
~\sna\Comti\Tutorials\CedarBank\Ims subdirectory for IMS playback testing.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you create your own recording files using the turnaround feature of
diagnostic capture, the location of the files is irrelevant because you do not
need them.
