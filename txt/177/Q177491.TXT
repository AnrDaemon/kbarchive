TITLE   :XADM: Corrupted IPX Packets Cause Information Store to Stop
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0 SP1,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 exc5sp1

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 information store may stop responding at
random intervals with a Dr. Watson report similar to the following:

   Application exception occurred:
   App: Store.DBG (pid=240)
   When: 1/1/1997 @ 12:00:00.000
   Exception number: c0000005 (access violation)

CAUSE
=====

The information store may have received a corrupted IPX packet from the network
that caused the access violation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.0 Service Pack 1. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S.
Service Pack for Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on
obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K


MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT does not support checksums for IPX packets, so rather than corrupt
packets being dealt with at the network layer, this packet, with corrupt data,
is being passed on to the information store. The information store cannot deal
with this corruption and it stops.
