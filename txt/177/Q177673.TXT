CAUSE
=====

Each public information store periodically constructs a status message to send
to other public information stores with which it is participating in public
folder replication. This status message is sent when replica changes are sent by
any public folder. If an information store does not send any changes, this
process will occur once per day.

RESOLUTION
==========

The events stem from the source server, not the server receiving the incoming
public folder replication message. No action is required because they are
harmless.
