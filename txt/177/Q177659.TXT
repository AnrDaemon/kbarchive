TITLE   :Security Tab Missing in File Properties in Windows NT Explorer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you map a network drive to a remote share and view the properties of a file
or folder in that share, the Security tab may be missing.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the shared folder has a long file name and does not
conform to the 8.3 naming format.


RESOLUTION
==========

Use one of the following workarounds to resolve this issue:

 - Use a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) connection to connect to the share
   instead of mapping a drive letter. UNC connections use the following format:
   \\<servername>\<sharename>, where <servername> is the name
   of the server to which you want to connect and <sharename> is the name
   of the share to which you want to connect.

 - Use File Manager (Winfile.exe) instead of Windows NT Explorer.

 - Rename the folder using the 8.3 naming format.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
