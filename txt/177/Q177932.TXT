======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

NetBIOS name resolution using the LMHOSTS file is enabled by default during
Windows NT installation. You may want to configure Windows NT unattended Setup
so that LMHOSTS lookup is disabled. This article describes how to disable
LMHOSTS lookup during a Windows NT 4.0 unattended Setup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To disable LMHOSTS lookup during unattended Setup, follow these steps:

1. Create a new share on a network server and then copy the I386 folder (or
   appropriate platform folder) from the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM to the new share.

2. Using any text editor (such as Notepad), add the following entry to the
   [Unattended] section of the Unattend.txt file:

         OEMPreinstall = Yes

3. Save and then close the Unattend.txt file.

4. Create a new folder named $OEM$ in the share you created in step 1.

5. In the $OEM$ folder, create a file with the following entries. Save the file
   as <filename>.reg, where <filename> is your choice of names (for
   example, Mychange.reg):

         REGEDIT4

         [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NetBT\Parameters]
         "EnableLMHOSTS"=dword:00000000

6. In the $OEM$ folder, create a file named Cmdlines.txt. This file should
   contain the following entries, including the quotation marks surrounding the
   entry

         [Commands]
         "Regedit.exe /s .\<filename>.reg"

   where <filename> is the name of the registry file you created in the
   previous step.

7. Copy the Regedit.exe file from the share you created in step 1 to the $OEM$
   folder.

8. Run Windows NT 4.0 Setup in Unattended mode using the Unattend.txt file. For
   example, use the following command

   "winnt /u:unattend.txt /s:<sourcefiles>" (without the quotation marks)

   where <sourcefiles> is the location of the shared folder you created in
   step 1.
