TITLE   :Windows NT Boot Problem: Kernel File Is Missing From the Disk
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Microsoft Windows NT you receive the following error message:

   A kernel file is missing from the disk. Insert a system disk and restart the
   system.

The message is displayed before the boot options from the Boot.ini are shown.


CAUSE
=====

The file NTLDR is missing from the active system partition or the allocation for
\Ntldr's $DATA attribute has become so fragmented that the whole $DATA attribute
is not in the base FRS (file record segment).

MORE INFORMATION
================

After the Power On Self Test (POST), the Master Boot Record (MBR) reads the
partition table and jumps to the boot record.

The code that generates the error is in the boot record. The error is generated
if the NTLDR file cannot be found or if the $DATA attribute cannot be found.

Windows NT File System (NTFS) views each file or directory as a set of file
attributes. Elements such as the file's name, its security information, and its
data are all file attributes. Each attribute is identified by an attribute type
code and, optionally, an attribute name.


WORKAROUND
==========

When you experience this problem you can either:

1. Boot Microsoft Windows NT from floppy (using the NTLDR on the floppy disk).

2. Move the NTLDR file to a different physical location on disk (ren ntldr
   ntldr.sav, copy ntldr.sav ntldr).

3. Use an NTFS defrag utility to unfragment NTLDR.

4. Ensure the correct partition is marked active using either NT Disk
   administrator, or Boot to DOS and use FDISK.EXE to ensure the correct system
   partition is marked for boot.

And,

 - Obtain the Bcupdate.exe program, which updates the boot code of the NTFS
   bootsector. For information on obtaining the individual software update,
   contact Microsoft Product Support Services. For a complete list of Microsoft
   Product Support Services phone numbers and information on support costs,
   lease go to the following address on the World Wide Web:

   http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

 - Once you have obtained the software update create a Windows NT startup floppy
   disk and boot Windows NT using this disk. For additional information about
   how to create this disk, click the article number below to view the article
   in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   - Extract Bcupdate.exe and NTLDR from the software update.

   - Run Bcupdate.exe C: /F.

   - Other command line parameters supported:

   /q - Quiet mode (must include /y).
   /y - Don't confirm.
   /f - Force update of in use volume.
   /t - Only test for old boot code.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT 3.5x and
4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
