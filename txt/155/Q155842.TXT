PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbdta kbconversion

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you export your current presentation for the Internet as a PowerPoint
Animation, PowerPoint will create a .ppz file. If you do not save your
presentation before you close it, you will not have a PowerPoint presentation
(.ppt) file.

PowerPoint cannot directly open a PowerPoint Animation (.ppz) file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you want to convert a PowerPoint Animation file to a PowerPoint presentation
file, follow these steps.

NOTE: This procedure requires that you have the Microsoft PowerPoint Animation
Player for ActiveX installed.

1. Start the PowerPoint animation. You can do this by opening a Web page (HTML
   document) that contains a PowerPoint animation in Microsoft Internet Explorer
   or another Web browser and clicking the animation. If the .ppz file is saved
   to your local drive, you can also double-click it from Windows Explorer.

2. While the animation is running, use Windows Explorer to open your
   C:\Windows\Temp folder. You should see a file with a .ppt extension. Its file
   name will begin with a tilde (~). This is a PowerPoint presentation file.

3. Copy this file to a different folder and give it a more descriptive name.

For additional information about obtaining and installing the PowerPoint
Animation Player for ActiveX, please see the following article in the Microsoft
