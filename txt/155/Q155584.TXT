KEYWORDS:kbSSafe400 kbSSafe500 kbSSafe600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Projects are displayed without any files even though Visual SourceSafe Explorer
normally displays a list of projects in its database and any associated files
within the projects.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the projects are displayed without any files, find and fix the problem with
the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Determine if Status Search is in use. From the View menu, selecting a Status
   Search and choosing a particular user may result in an empty file list. This
   means a particular user does not have any files in the selected project. To
   cancel the query, select the View menu and click Cancel Search. Cancel Search
   will be grayed out if a Query is not in progress.

2. Determine if Rights are turned off through the Visual SourceSafe Admin
   utility. In the Visual SourceSafe Admin utility, choose Options and Project
   Security from the Tools menu, and clear the "Enable Project Security" check
   box. In Visual SourceSafe, choose Security Setup from the Users menu, and
   clear the "Enable Security System" check box.

If the files still do not appear and the user has at least "Read" rights, then
there is probably corruption in one of the .dat files. Copy the Version.dat,
Rights.dat, and Status.dat files from the Vss\Data directory to a backup
directory. Run DDCONV -S <path to Data directory> to rebuild the .dat
files. Alternatively run Analyze.exe with the -f switch. Users of Visual
SourceSafe version 4.0 should obtain the latest version of Analyze and DDCONV
and should obtain build 1309 of Visual SourceSafe from Microsoft Technical
Support.

NOTE: Be careful of serial numbers on versions prior to 3.02. To view the version
number, choose About from the Help menu.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
