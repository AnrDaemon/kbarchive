TITLE   :Network Neighborhood Cannot Open NFS Folders
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are attempting to view a folder on a remote computer using an NFS
client using Network Neighborhood, you may receive the following error message:

   The filename, directory name or volume label syntax is incorrect

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT Explorer cannot connect to some NFS volumes.

Some versions of NFS redirectors do not support deviceless connections, which is
how the Windows NT Explorer implements opening folders.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can work around this problem by mapping the NFS volume directly to a drive
letter using either File Manager or the command line. The exact syntax and
method will vary according to the NFS vendor. Please consult your documentation
or vendor for the necessary syntax information.
