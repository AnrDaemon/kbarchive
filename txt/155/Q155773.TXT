======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you replace hyperlinked text with new text, the Uniform Resource Locator
(URL) does not change; only the display text changes. For example, if you type
the following URL in a Microsoft Word document

   http://www.microsoft.com

both the hyperlink and the display text are http://www.microsoft.com.

However, if you change your mind, select the URL link, and type

   http://www.msn.com

the underlying link remains http://www.microsoft.com, but the display text is now
http://www.msn.com.

CAUSE
=====

The hyperlinking feature in Microsoft Word 97 is designed to automatically
create a hyperlink object when you type any text that begins with the following
protocols:

   http://
   ftp://
   gopher://
   Mailto:

As part of this design, you can change the display text by selecting the
hyperlink and typing the new text. However, to change the URL, you need to open
the Edit Hyperlink dialog box.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, using the right mouse button, click the hyperlink,
point to Hyperlink, click Edit Hyperlink, and then type the new URL in the Link
To File or URL text box.
