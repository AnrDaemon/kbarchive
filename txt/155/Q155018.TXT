PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup dun kbDialUp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing Windows NT 4.0, if you choose to connect to the network
using Dial-Up Networking and you choose to join a domain, Setup tries to start
the network and register the computer on the domain. However, Setup does not
dial the modem to connect you to the remote network.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT cannot set up the Dial-Up Networking session at this point in Setup.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, set up your computer as a workgroup. Once Setup is
finished, establish a Dial-Up Networking connection to the network and join the
domain.
