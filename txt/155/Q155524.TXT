TITLE   :SMS 1.1 Client Program Group Always Pops Up in Windows NT 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup smssetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Windows NT 4.0 Server and Workstation become client computers in Systems
Management Server, the SMS client program group opens when you log on and it
remains open until the logon script completes. You can minimize or close the
program group, but the program group appears during each logon.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT 4.0 handles program group/item DDE actions differently. SMSRUN32 uses
DDE to manipulate the SMS client group. Therefore, in Systems Management Server
1.1, the symptom mentioned above occurs.

This behavior does not occur in Systems Management Server 1.2 and Windows NT 4.0.
