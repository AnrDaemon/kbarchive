TITLE   :PRB: ActiveX Controls That Do Not Work Correctly in VFP
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:5.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Visual FoxPro version 5.0 supports ActiveX controls (.ocx files) and
includes a set of ActiveX controls that you can add to and distribute with your
applications. There are many vendors creating ActiveX controls for developers to
use in their applications, but not all ActiveX controls work in Visual FoxPro
5.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Some ActiveX controls are designed to work only in specific containers or
products. An example of this is the Microsoft Marquee control that is designed
to scroll text in an Internet Browser. This article lists ActiveX controls from
other vendors that do not work correctly in Visual FoxPro 5.0. If an ActiveX
control does not work in Visual FoxPro 5.0, you should contact the vendor to
find out if the control was tested in Visual FoxPro or was designed to work only
in a specific container or product. You should also check to see if there is an
updated version that may work in Visual FoxPro 5.0.

To view .ocx file version information, alternate mouse click on the .ocx file in
the Windows Explorer and choose Properties from the pop-up menu. Because an OCX
may contain more then one control, there may be cases where some controls work
and some do not, even though they are both in the same .ocx file.

Below is a list of non-Microsoft ActiveX controls that do not work correctly in
Visual FoxPro 5.0.
