The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

When you send mail using a Microsoft Exchange client, you receive the following
error message:

   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

   Subject: Subject of the message
   Sent: 7/19/96 11:20:50 AM

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

   John Doe on 7/19/96 11:20:52 AM
   No transport provider was available for delivery to this recipient.

CAUSE
=====

This error is generally caused by an invalid recipient address. It can present
itself when the address is an unrecognized or unsupported address type.

For example, using the Personal Address Book (PAB) to address mail. Typically,
when migrating to Microsoft Exchange, users will tend to use a PAB entry to
address mail. In some instances, the address looks like the friendly name that
is also in the GAL, but when getting details of the user in the PAB, the address
will contain that of the old mail system.

RESOLUTION
==========

Delete the address from the PAB and then add the user back into the PAB from the
Global Address Book (GAL).
