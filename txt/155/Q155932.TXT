======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual FoxPro 5.0, if you are creating a form with some objects based on a
form class that has the ScaleMode property set to 0-Foxel, and you change the
ScaleMode property to 3-Pixel in the form class, the existing objects in the
subclassed form are placed in the wrong location. All the objects in the
subclassed form are placed on top of each other towards the top left of the
form.

WORKAROUND
==========

Set the form class ScaleMode property to 0-Foxels, re-open the subclassed form,
and set the subclassed form's ScaleMode property to 3-Pixels. Save the
subclassed form. Now, go back to the form class and change the ScaleMode
property of the form class to 3-Pixels.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
