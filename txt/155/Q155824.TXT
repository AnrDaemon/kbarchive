-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install drivers for the Panasonic KXL-D740 4X CDROM using the
KXLC002 PC Card, Windows NT 4.0 may detect the PCMCIA SCSI card as the AMD PCI
SCSI Controller/Ethernet Adapter. This is the incorrect driver for this adapter.

RESOLUTION
==========

To install the proper driver follow the steps outlined below:

1. From the Windows NT 4.0 compact disc, copy the contents of the
   \DRVLIB\STORAGE\KXL002\I386 directory to a blank floppy disk.

2. Start the SCSI Adapters tool in Control Panel and choose the Drivers Tab.

3. If the AMD SCSI driver has been installed incorrectly, select it from the
   list and click the "Remove" button and answer Yes to remove the driver.

4. Click Add to install the proper driver.

5. From the Install Driver dialog box, click the "Have Disk..." button.

6. Insert the disk containing the files you copied in the floppy disk drive and
   click OK.

7. Select the "Panasonic KXLC002 SCSI Host Adapter" from the list of available
   drivers and click OK.

8. From the Windows NT Setup dialog box, type "A:\" (without quotes) in text box
   and then click Continue.

9. When the installation is complete, restart your system.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Panasonic KXL-D740 4X CDROM with the KXLC002 PC Card is on the current
Hardware Compatibility List as a Non-SCSI CDROM drive. Although this is a SCSI
device, it is listed here because the CDROM drive and PCMCIA SCSI controller
have not been tested separately. Therefore, the Panasonic KXL-D740 4X CDROM
drive is not supported on other SCSI controllers and other SCSI devices are not
supported with the KXLC002 PC Card SCSI Adapter.

The Panasonic KXL-D740 4X CDROM with the KXLC002 PC Card is manufactured by
Panasonic, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or
otherwise, regarding this product's performance or reliability.
