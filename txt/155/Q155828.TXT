SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector (IMC) has an option to enter a
retrieve mail command. To find this option:

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.

2. Double-click Configuration in the left-hand pane in the Site containing the
   IMC.

3. Double-click Connections in the right-hand pane.

4. Double-click the Internet Mail Connector object in the right-hand pane.

5. Click the Dial-Up Connections tab.

6. Under the Mail Retrieval heading or button, the Type Command field is the
   command to "trigger" the remote system to send mail.

The retrieve mail command (commonly known as the "trigger" command) can be any
locally executable program. Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) provide a
facility for subscribers to "trigger" their inbound mail by performing some
action like "finger" or "ping". This method for retrieving the mail must be set
up with the ISP. The ISP will have to configure their system to hold queued SMTP
messages for you. Commonly, this is known as a relay host. The host will hold
the queued mail until the command is ran to trigger the host to send to the IMC.
