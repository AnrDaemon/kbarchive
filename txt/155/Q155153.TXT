======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Pasting with the Paste command behaves differently than pasting with a keyboard
shortcut (CTRL+V).

When you press CTRL+V, the insertion point is placed after the text you just
inserted. When you click Paste on the Edit menu (the scissors), the insertion
point is placed before the text you just inserted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior appears to be consistent in all modules (for example, Web Pages,
Writing Ideas) of Creative Writer.
