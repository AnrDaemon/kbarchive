======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), included with:
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual C++ version 4.0, the compiler switches /QIfdiv, /Qif, and /QI6 are not
documented. In Visual C++ version 4.1, the switch /QIfdiv is now documented.
Below is a list of the default behavior of each switch in Visual C++ version 4.0
and version 4.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

/QIfdiv

   This switch is turned on by default in VC 4.0. It is turned off (/QIfdiv-) by
   default in VC 4.1. /QIfdiv is a workaround for the Pentium floating-point
   bug. /QIfdiv causes emulator functions to be used.

/QIf

   This switch is unchanged. /QIf forces the .debug$F FPO debug information to
   be output always. This allows a backtrace of the stack even when some of the
   kernel stack has been paged out.

/QI6

   This was an undocumented switch to work around P6 problems and it was off by
   default in VC 4.0. This switch was removed in VC 4.1 but its functionality is
   still there and is turned on by default.
