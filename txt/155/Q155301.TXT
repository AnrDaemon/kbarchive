SYMPTOMS
========

The games listed at the top of this article may cause your machine to stop
responding (hang) when you are playing a multiplayer game if the host
disconnects.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is no resolution to this problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In any product using Direct Play 2.0, the host machine maintains the connection.
All TCP, IPX and TCP/IP information and initializations are maintained by the
host machine. When the connection is terminated, the session is terminated for
all members of the session. This is as expected.
