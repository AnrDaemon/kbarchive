SYMPTOMS
========

You get the following error message when you attempt to run an ActiveX control
in Word 97.

   The server application, source file, or item cannot be found. Make sure the
   application is properly installed, and that it has not been deleted, moved or
   renamed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you attempt to use an ActiveX control, such as the
Microsoft FTP Control, which is installed by the Microsoft ActiveX Internet
Controls setup program. This problem also occurs when you attempt to use an
ActiveX control from Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools. These controls
are not currently supported by Word 97. This error message may occur when you
attempt to use other Microsoft or third-party ActiveX Controls.


Word 97 currently supports a number of ActiveX controls to help you build
interactive forms and for data access. You can install these controls if you
choose a complete/custom installation of Word 97 or Office 97.

The use of third-party or other Microsoft ActiveX controls that are not shipped
with Word 97 are not supported by Microsoft Technical Support.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
