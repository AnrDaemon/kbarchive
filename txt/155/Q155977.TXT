More Wizards and Templates

Microsoft Word provides many wizards and templates to help you create great
documents. For example, the Letter Wizard helps you format a letter for
professional or personal use, and the Fax Wizard creates a cover page and sends
your document to someone else.

If you have not found the template or wizard you're looking for, look in the
following places for additional templates or wizards.

 - Rerun Setup, and click the Custom button to install additional files.

   NOTE: This is the incorrect text that appears in the More Wizards and
   Templates template.

 - Go to Tools on the Web and download templates and wizards. Tools on the Web
   is located at the following address on the World Wide Web:

   http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/Default.aspx

 - If you installed Microsoft Word from a compact disc, insert the CD-ROM disc
   and double-click the ValuPack folder to see what other templates and wizards
   are available. Copy the files you want to the following location:

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Templates

How to install additional templates
-----------------------------------

1. Quit all Microsoft Office programs, including the Microsoft Office Shortcut
   Bar.

2. Start the Setup program. On the Windows taskbar, click Start, point to
   Settings and click Control Panel.

3. Click Add/Remove Programs.

4. Click Microsoft Office 97 and click the Install button.

   The Setup program starts and the Installation Maintenance Program dialog box
   appears. The four choices that appear in the dialog box are Add/Remove,
   Reinstall, Remove All, and Online Registration.

5. If you are using disks, place disk one into the appropriate disk drive (drive
   A or drive B). Otherwise, insert the Office CD into the CD-ROM drive.

   NOTE: The More Wizards and Templates available on the Office 97 and Word 97
   CD-ROM are not available from disks. To obtain additional wizards and
   templates for use in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, please see the following
   article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q163549 WD97: Downloads and Updates Available from Microsoft

6. Click Add/Remove.

7. Click Wizards and Templates (do not clear the check box next to Wizards and
   Templates) and click Change Option.

8. Select the wizards and templates you want to install, and then click the OK
   button twice.

9. Click Continue.

   The Installation Maintenance program installs the selected wizards and
   templates. The program will prompt you to insert the required disks.

NOTE: Do not clear any check boxes in the Installation Maintenance program. If
you clear a check box, the Installation Maintenance program will remove the
corresponding component of the program.
