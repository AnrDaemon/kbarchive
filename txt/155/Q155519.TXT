SUMMARY
=======

FilterKeys is an Accessibility option that you can use to control the keyboard
repeat rate and ignore repeated keys. This article discusses how to use the
FilterKeys shortcut key to enable various levels of FilterKeys functionality.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Enabling the FilterKeys Shortcut Key
------------------------------------

The FilterKeys shortcut key is the right SHIFT key. To enable the shortcut key to
start FilterKeys functionality, use the following steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Accessibility Options.

2. Click the Keyboard tab, click Settings in the FilterKeys section, and then
   click the Use Shortcut check box to select it.

3. Click OK, and then click OK again.

Description of Terms Associated with FilterKeys
-----------------------------------------------

SlowKeys - The sensitivity of the keyboard can be a problem, especially if you
strike keys accidentally. SlowKeys instructs Windows to disregard keys that are
not held down for a certain period of time.

RepeatKeys - Most keyboards allow you to repeat a key just by holding it down. If
you cannot lift your fingers off the keyboard quickly enough, this can result in
unintentionally repeated characters. RepeatKeys lets you adjust the repeat rate
or disable it altogether.

BounceKeys - You may "bounce" keys, resulting in double strokes of the same key
or other similar errors. BounceKeys instructs Windows to ignore unintended
keystrokes.

Description of Tones Produced by the FilterKeys Shortcut Key
------------------------------------------------------------

If you press down and hold the right SHIFT key for four seconds, you hear three
short warning tones. No functionality is enabled with these warning tones.

If you hold the right SHIFT key for eight seconds, in addition to the previous
tones, you hear a rising tone and the following default FilterKeys settings (or
the last settings saved) are enabled:

 - RepeatKeys: On, one second

 - SlowKeys: On, one second

 - BounceKeys: Off

If you hold the right SHIFT key for eight seconds, in addition to the previous
tones, you hear two rising tones and the following Emergency Level 1 FilterKeys
settings are enabled:

 - RepeatKeys: Off

 - SlowKeys: Off

 - BounceKeys: On, one second

Holding down the right SHIFT key another four seconds (16 seconds total) produces
three rising tones and invokes the Emergency Level 2 setting with the following
settings:

 - RepeatKeys: Off

 - SlowKeys: On, two seconds

 - BounceKeys: Off
