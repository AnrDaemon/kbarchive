SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to format a Seagate ST31051N hard disk using an Adaptec AHA-1740a
or AHA-1742a controller with the Format.com tool from Microsoft MS-DOS 6.22 or
Windows 95, you may receive one or more of the following error messages:

   - Drive not ready.

   - Cannot write directory, format failed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

 - Use the Adaptec 1740/42a EISA configuration tool to reduce the drive
   throughput speed to 5.0 MB/sec. Please refer to the Adaptec controller
   documentation for additional information about this process.

 - Use a different controller.
