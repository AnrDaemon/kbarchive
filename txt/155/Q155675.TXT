KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbpolicy win95 kbAPI kbSDKPlatform kbWinsock kbGrpDSNetkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Windows Sockets setsockopt() API is called with the IPX_RECVHDR option
set, the call will return a status of "success," but IPX headers will not be
received when the recv() API is called.

CAUSE
=====

There is a problem in the Windows Sockets support using the Microsoft
IPX/SPX-compatible protocol, in that IPX headers are not returned with the
WinSock data, even though it appears that the IPX_RECVHDR option is successfully
set when calling setsockopt().

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.
