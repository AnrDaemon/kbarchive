======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When single-stepping through a SQL Server stored procedure, error messages, if
generated, are not displayed at the point where the error occurred.

STATUS
======

We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To reproduce this behavior, create and single-step through the following stored
procedure in the SQL Server Pubs sample database:

   ------------------------------
   CREATE PROCEDURE sp_trigger AS

   INSERT authors
       VALUES ('123-21-2321', 'Redmond', 'Ricky', '206/555-1212',
             '123 Nowhere St.', 'Redmond', 'WA', '98989', DEFAULT )
   DECLARE @a INTEGER
   SELECT @a = 4/2
   RETURN
   ------------------------------

The INSERT statement fails because there is no DEFAULT defined for the last
field. However, the user is not notified that the insertion failed until the
stored procedure completes.
