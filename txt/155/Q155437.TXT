TITLE   :PRB: "Invalid DOS Path" Error Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:4.00 5.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

While doing a GET or VIEW from the Show History dialog, a Check In of a large
file, or a Difference on a large file, the user gets the following message:

   "Invalid DOS path <drive>:<path>"

CAUSE
=====

The Temp_Path setting in the SRCSAFE.INI file is set to an invalid directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Edit the SRCSAFE.INI file and change the Temp_Path setting to an existing
directory.

If Temp_Path is set to a network drive make sure that the network connection is
stable.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SRCSAFE.INI file has an initialization variable called Temp_Path. This tells
Visual SourceSafe where to put its temporary files. If Temp-Path is set to a
non-existent location, an error will occur when Visual SourceSafe attempts to
access the non-existent location.

Visual SourceSafe will use a temporary directory when any one of the following
actions is performed:

1. Doing a GET of an older version of a file from the Show History dialog that
   it can't fit into memory. This is more likely to happen with binary files.

2. Doing a VIEW of an older version of a file from the Show History dialog.

3. Doing a Check In of a large file that it can't fit into memory. This is more
   likely to happen with binary files.

4. Doing a Difference on a large file that it can't fit into memory. This is
   more likely to happen with binary files.

If the Temp_Path in the SRCSAFE.INI file is invalid, it may corrupt the file when
any of the previously-mentioned actions are performed. By default, Temp_Path is
set to a directory called "temp" that is created by the server installation.
Therefore, this situation should only arise if a user has edited the SRCSAFE.INI
file.
