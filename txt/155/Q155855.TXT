SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to print orange text to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet 1200c, the
text will be printed as yellow rather than orange. If you have graphic objects
that are the same shade of orange on the same slide, the objects will be printed
as orange.

CAUSE
=====

Many DeskJet printers cannot dither text. They can only print text in their
primary ink colors or colors made be mixing 50% of their primary ink colors.
DeskJets are limited to the following text colors: cyan, magenta, yellow, black,
white, red, green, and blue. Whenever you print text that is not one of these
colors, the printer prints the text as the color in the list above that is
closest to the actual text color.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you need text that is another color, you can create the text as a WordArt
object. WordArt objects appear to be text, but are actually pictures that
contain complex polygon shapes. These WordArt objects do not share this printer
limitation.
