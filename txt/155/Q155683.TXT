KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry. Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore the Registry if an issue occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

Messages have an address in the From line that is not authentic.

CAUSE
=====

This is done by using Telnet to connect to the mail host on port 25 and by
typing RFC-821 SMTP commands to simulate the arrival of a new message. When
these messages are received by the Microsoft Exchange Server Internet Mail
Service (or Internet Mail Connector, in version 4.0), the address is compared to
the Microsoft Exchange Directory. If the address matches a directory entry, the
address is replaced in the message header. This means that the spoofed messages
look identical to internally sent Exchange Server messages.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue:

 - On the File menu, click Properties.

   If a Headers tab is present, the message was not sent by another Microsoft
   Exchange Server user in your organization.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 4.0 , 5.0 and 5.5. This issue was corrected in the latest Microsoft
Exchange Service Packs. For information on obtaining the Service Packs, query on
the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

For the Exchange Server administrator to enable either version of Microsoft
Exchange Server to check the From line, follow these steps:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious issues that may
require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that issues that
result from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit.

1. On the Microsoft Exchange Server computer, start Regedt32.exe.

2. Add two values to the IMC Registry Key, under:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/MSExchangeIMC/Parameters

3. On the Edit/Add value menu, add the following:

      Value Name: TurfDir
      Data Type: REG_SZ

      C:\Exchsrvr\Imcdata\Turfdir

   This is the directory where matched messages is stored.

4. On the Edit menu, click Add to add the following:

      Value Name: TurfTable
      Data Type: REG_MULTI_SZ

      user1@site.domain
      user2@site.domain

The Turf Table contains a list of e-mail addresses used to verify the From
address on incoming Internet mail. The addresses are not case sensitive and
should be entered one per line with no extra spaces or delimiters. If a match is
found, the message is saved to the directory specified in the TURFDIR value. In
Exchange 5.5 you can add the domain values instead of adding single user names.
For example, @site.domain.


5. Restart the Internet Mail Connector service.
