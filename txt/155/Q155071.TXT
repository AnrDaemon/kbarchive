KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft 16-bit PowerPoint Viewer for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you show a PowerPoint 95 presentation in the 16-bit PowerPoint Viewer, some
of the sounds may not be played. Sounds that are not played include sounds that
are attached to a slide transition or are part of the Animation Settings of a
slide show object.

These sounds are played if you use PowerPoint 95 or the 32-bit PowerPoint Viewer
to run the slide show.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are several ways to add a sound to a PowerPoint 95 presentation.

NOTE: Two of the methods are not supported by the 16-bit PowerPoint viewer.

Method 1: Insert the Sound as an OLE Object
-------------------------------------------

This method is supported by the 16-bit PowerPoint Viewer.

1. On the Insert menu, click Sound.

2. Choose the sound file you would like to insert. Click OK.

3. With the Sound object selected, on the Tools menu, click Animation Settings.

4. Click Play from the Play Options list.

Method 2: Play a Sound as an Animation Setting for Another Object
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This method is supported by the 32-bit PowerPoint Viewer only.

1. With a PowerPoint drawing or text object selected, on the Tools menu select
   Animation Settings.

2. Choose a build effect for the object.

3. Click the sound you would like to play from the Sounds list. Click Other
   Sounds if the sound you want is not on this list.

Method 3: Attach a Sound to a Slide Transition
----------------------------------------------

This method is not supported by the 16-bit PowerPoint Viewer.

1. On the Tools menu, click Slide Transition.

2. Click the sound you would like from the Sounds list. Click Other Sounds if
   the sound you want is not on this list.

When you view a PowerPoint 95 presentation with the 16-bit PowerPoint Viewer, the
presentation is temporarily converted to a PowerPoint 4.0 presentation. Sounds
attached to the presentation using methods 2 or 3 don't have equivalent sounds
in PowerPoint 4.0 and are ignored.
