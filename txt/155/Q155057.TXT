SUMMARY

ScanLogicalLocksByName is a new application programming interface (API) function
that is supported in File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) with the

enumeration of connections with logical locks.

This new function enumerates the connections that have a given logical lock
logged. Given a logical lock name, it returns all connections that have the lock
logged. Note that logical locks are different than normal MS-DOS locks. They are
just named lock objects that different applications can use to coordinate
locking.
