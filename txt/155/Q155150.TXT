KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you send an e-mail package from Creative Writer when your e-mail program is
not currently running, you may be asked to choose an e-mail profile even if you
only have one profile on the machine and/or you have set a default profile using
the Mail And Fax feature in Control Panel.

NOTE: This behavior has been observed with Microsoft Exchange installed on
Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0. Microsoft Exchange is a MAPI (Messaging
Application Programming Interface) compliant e-mail program. Microsoft did not
test other e-mail programs during the writing of this article.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure your e-mail program is running before you try to send an e-mail
package from Creative Writer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the e-mail program is open at the time you send the email package, you may
not be prompted for a profile.
