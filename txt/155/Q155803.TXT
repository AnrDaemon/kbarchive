TITLE   :DOC: Cross-Tab Query Help Example is Incorrect
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdocfix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The example in the Visual FoxPro Help file, versions 3.0 and 3.0b, under
"Creating Cross-Tab Queries" is incorrect. If you cut and paste this code into a
program and then run it, the following error message appears:

   Command contains unrecognized phrase/keyword

This is caused by a missing comma (,) just after the right bracket (]) on the
first line.

Once you make this correction and run the program, a second error message
appears:

   Variable "MYCURSOR" is not found

You can correct this problem by declaring MyCursor as a PUBLIC variable.

This documentation error has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Following is the example code as it should appear:

      PUBLIC MyCursor
      SELECT Orders.to_city, YEAR[orders.order_date], ;
         SUM(Orders.order_amt) ;
         FROM TestData!Orders ;
         GROUP BY Orders.to_city, 2 ;
         ORDER BY Orders.to_city, 2 ;
         INTO CURSOR MyCursor
      DO (_GENXTAB) WITH MyCursor
      BROWSE NOMODIFY

When running version 3.0b of Visual FoxPro, the following error message might
also appear:

   File does not exist

To correct this, place the following command as the first line in your Config.fpw
file:

      _GENXTAB = C:\VFP\VFPXTAB.PRG
