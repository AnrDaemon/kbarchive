TITLE   :WD97: ListNum Field Not Converted Saving to Word 6.0/95
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbualink97 kbfield word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you convert a Word 97 for Windows document that contains ListNum fields to
Word 6.0/95 format and open the document in Word 6.0 (Windows or Macintosh) or
7.0 (Windows), you see the following error in place of the fields or numbers:

   Error: Bookmark not Defined!

CAUSE
=====

ListNum fields do not have an equivalent field in earlier versions of Word and
are not translated during conversion. The ListNum field is retained to allow for
round-trip conversions back to Word 97 for Windows and Word 98 Macintosh
Edition.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem and prevent the "Error! Bookmark Not Defined"
message, lock the fields before you convert the document to Word 6.0/95 format.
When you reopen the document in Word 97 for Windows or Word 98 Macintosh
Edition, unlock and update the fields.

Word 98 Macintosh Edition
