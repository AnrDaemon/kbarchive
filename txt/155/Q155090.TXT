TITLE   :BUG: Setup Wizard Doesn't Have Netsetup Distribution Option
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:3.00b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Setup Wizard, an option for "Netsetup" is not available. The
Setup Wizard will always create disk folders sized for distribution on high
density floppy disks.

WORKAROUND
==========

The following steps can be used to simulate a Netsetup method of distribution:

1. Complete the Setup Wizard. For this example, refer to the application as
   MyApp.

2. Create a folder for network access. For this example, refer to this folder as
   NetFolder.

3. Copy each created disk folder, such as Install Disk 3 and Setup Disk, to
   NetFolder.

4. From the NetFolder:Setup Disk, make an alias of MyApp Setup.

5. Move this alias up one level to the root of NetFolder. The executable should
   now be installable from this alias.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Macintosh Finder will treat folders at the same level as mounted volumes
(floppy disks) so that a floppy disk-type install is approximated.
