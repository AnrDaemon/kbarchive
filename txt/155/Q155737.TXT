TITLE   :StickyKeys Feature Deactivated Without Notice
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenable kbui kbEnableSight kbEnableMove

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you enable the StickyKeys feature by pressing the SHIFT key five times while
the Accessibility tool is active and then close the tool, the StickyKeys feature
is turned off, but no audio notification is played.

CAUSE
=====

When you enable the StickyKeys feature by pressing the SHIFT key five times
while the Accessibility tool is active, the check box to enable StickyKeys is
not activated. The fact that the feature was enabled is not recorded when the
settings information is rewritten from the tool, and a state change is not
generated. Therefore, no audio notification occurs.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post more information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
