TITLE   :IIS Security Concern Using Batch Files for CGI
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Web clients that send Common Gateway Interface (CGI) requests to Internet
Information Server (IIS) servers using batch files (.bat or .cmd) as CGI
applications may gain undesired levels of access to the IIS server.

CAUSE
=====

Internet Information Server 1.0 (IIS) allowed the use of batch files as CGI
applications. Using batch files as CGI applications exposed several security
issues in IIS because the batch file processes run in the context of the full
Windows NT console command processor (cmd.exe).


RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain the fix referenced below.

STATUS
======

Batch file processing support was removed from the IIS product due to security
concerns.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in IIS version 1.0. This problem was
corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For information on
obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
