TITLE   :STOP 0x00000036 On Shutdown Running RAS Server with a Digiboard
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you run the Remote Access Services (RAS) Server service on a computer with
a Digiboard installed, Windows NT Server stops responding during shutdown. A
blue screen appears and the following stop error message appears:

   STOP 0x00000036 (0xfcc89940, 0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)
   DEVICE_REFERENCE_COUNT_NOT_ZERO.

NOTE: The first parameter will fall within the address range of the Digifep5.sys
driver.

CAUSE
=====

The device driver has attempted to delete one of its device objects from the
system, but the reference count for that object was non-zero, meaning that there
are still outstanding references to the device. This indicates that there is a
problem in the calling driver, in this case Digifep5.sys.

RESOLUTION
==========

Disable the RAS Server or install one of the latest Digiboard drivers from the
Digiboard FTP site (Digiboard released new drivers on July 31, 1996):

   ftp://ftp.digibd.com/drivers/winnt/821m.exe.

NOTE: This self-extracting executable file contains drivers for all platforms
except MIPS; those files are stored in the Drivers/MIPS sub- directory.
