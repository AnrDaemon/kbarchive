SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Administrator program can automatically generate custom
recipients based on information provided in an import file.

This article describes the minimum custom recipient attributes required to
automatically import SMTP custom recipients.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following attributes are required to generate SMTP custom recipients:

   Obj-Class, First Name, Last name, Display Name, Alias Name, Directory Name,
   E-mail addresses

The Header.exe program included in the Microsoft Exchange Resource Kit could be
used to create an Import file with the above headers. The above headers could
also be manually added to a file, using a text editor.

Once the import file has been created with the desired headers, the corresponding
data for each custom recipient should be added to the file. For example:

   Remote,User1,User1,User1,User1,SMTP:User@ORG.COM

Additional query words: custom recipients SMTP
