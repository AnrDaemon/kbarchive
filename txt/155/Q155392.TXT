The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When creating a connection to access remote data, you can create a connection
that does not require an ODBC datasource. Because this method does not require
an existing ODBC datasource, you do not have to be concerned with setting up the
datasource in the ODBC administrator. This simplifies the task of application
distribution.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following steps outline how to create a connection that does not require an
ODBC datasource. The connection will be called CONNECT1, and it accesses a SQL
Server backend with the following attributes:

   Server Name = SQL1
   Logon User ID = USER
   Logon Password = password
   DATABASE = pubs

You can create the connection either programmatically or using the Connection
Designer. Both of these methods will be addressed.

Creating the Connection Programmatically
----------------------------------------

1. Open a database in which to store the connection.

2. Enter the following command in the Command window:

   

         CREATE CONNECTION CONNECT1 CONNSTRING "DRIVER={SQL Server};
            SERVER=SQL1;UID=USER;PWD=password;DATABASE=pubs"

   NOTE: You should enter this command on one line.

Creating the Connection Using the Connection Designer
-----------------------------------------------------

1. Open a database in which to store the connection.

2. From the File menu, click New.

3. Specify a new connection.

4. In the Connection Designer, select the "Connection String" option button.

5. Enter the following for the Connect String:

   

         DRIVER={SQL Server};SERVER=SQL1;UID=USER;PWD=password;DATABASE=pubs

6. Close the Connection Designer, and save the connection as CONNECT1.

To test the connection, enter the following in the Command window:

   

      ?SQLConnect('CONNECT1')

A return value greater than zero indicates a successful connection.
