======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add a new machine account to the domain in Server Manager, you receive
the following error message:

   A Machine Account for <machine name> Already Exists.

You receive this message even though no other machine account with this name
exists in the domain.

CAUSE
=====

A user account name exists with a dollar sign ($) symbol as the last character.
For example, if there is a user account named "Tracey$" and you attempt to add a
machine account named "Tracey," you will receive the error message. By default,
Windows NT saves user account names in the registry as <user name>$.

RESOLUTION
==========

Open User Manager for Domains and either remove or rename the user account.
