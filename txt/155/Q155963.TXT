TITLE   :WD97: Fax Wizard Sends Cover Sheets Before Form Letters
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbualink97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you fax multiple form letters using the Fax Wizard, all of the cover sheets
are faxed first, then the form letter is faxed. The side-effect of this is that
if you have a large number of faxes to send, the recipient may receive other
faxes between the time they get your cover sheet and the time they get the form
letter.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, choose one of the following methods:

Method 1
--------

Merge fewer documents when merging to fax.

Method 2
--------

Create a mail merge main document that includes a cover sheet and then merge to
fax.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Even when faxing a single document using the Fax Wizard, 2 documents are
created; one is the fax cover sheet and the other is the document you wish to
fax. When the fax is sent, it will be sent as 2 separate faxes; the cover sheet
and the document.

This problem is most noticeable when merging to electronic fax because more
documents and cover sheets are involved.
