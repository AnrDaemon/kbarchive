The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you are creating multiple Distribution Lists (DLs) or user mailboxes with
prefixes or names that contain a hyphen, a mail client address search will not
recognize the hyphen. For example, this would occur with the prefixes XX-, JA-,
or a name such as Mary-Anne.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The hyphen is ignored in address searches, so searches on "ja-" or "Mary-Anne"
return every James and Jane or MaryA in the address book. This can be problem
for international users, any names that are hyphenated, and distribution lists
that contain a hyphen. An address search recognizes the slash mark (/) and the
underscore (_), characters but does not recognize the hyphen.
