TITLE   :PCMCIA.SYS Fails to Load w/ Cirrus Logic CL-PD6730 Controller
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems using a Cirrus Logic CL-PD6730 PCMCIA controller(Intel-PCIC Chip) may
cause Pcmcia.SYS to fail to load upon startup.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs when the value of the Interrupt Line register is set to 255
(OxFF) on systems using the above mentioned Cirrus Logic controller.

According to the PCI Local Bus Specification Revision 2.1, the Interrupt Line and
Interrupt Pin registers are defined as follows:

Interrupt Line register:
------------------------

For x86 based personal computers, the values in this register correspond to the
IRQ. 255 is defined as meaning "unknown" or "no connection" to the interrupt
controller.

Interrupt Pin register:
-----------------------

The Interrupt Pin register tells which interrupt pin the device (or device
function) uses. Devices (or device functions) that do not use an interrupt pin
must put a zero in this register.


RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain the fix referenced below.

STATUS
======
