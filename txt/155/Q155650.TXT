SUMMARY
=======

This article contains information from the Monster Truck Madness Readme.txt
file.

Changing your view to another truck after a race ends does not work
while the pit board is displayed.

Usually when you're racing, you can press K to switch the camera
focus to the next truck. When you win a multiplayer race, you may
find you are unable to switch your view anymore. To enable
switching camera focus to the next truck after you've won a
multiplayer race, hide the pit board by pressing O. You can then
press K as usual to switch the camera focus to the next truck.
