TITLE   :Cannot Boot Windows NT from CD-ROM
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A computer that can boot from the CD-ROM drive may not be able to boot from the
Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM.

CAUSE
=====

A computer can boot from the Windows NT CD-ROM only if both the SCSI BIOS and
the system BIOS support the El Torito specification. Computers that do not
successfully boot from the Windows NT CD-ROM either do not support the
specification or do not support it fully.

There are three ways to support the El Torito specification: Emulating a floppy
disk, emulating a hard disk, or using no emulation. Windows NT requires using no
emulation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Some computers have a configuration tool that permits you to choose the boot
order among the floppy disk drive, hard disk, or CD-ROM drive. If your computer
has a configurable boot order, verify that the CD-ROM drive is first in the
sequence, and set to No Emulation.

If your computer is not configurable, or does not adhere to the El Torito
specification, contact your computer's manufacturer for information concerning
an upgrade.

MORE INFORMATION
