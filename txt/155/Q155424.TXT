TITLE   :Windows NT Domain Does Not Accept New Domain Password
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork win95kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to log on to a Windows NT domain with an account whose password
has expired from a Windows 95-based computer with password synchronization
enabled, a dialog box appears prompting you to change your password. When you
enter the old password and then the new password, you receive a message stating
the password has been changed successfully, and then the following error message
appears:

   The Domain password you supplied is incorrect, or access to your logon server
   has been denied.

You must then click OK and enter the new domain password again.

CAUSE
=====

Once the initial logon request has been serviced by the Windows NT domain
controller and the password change has taken place, the Windows 95 network
provider (Msnp32.dll) performs another logon request using the original
password, not the new one. This can result in accounts being locked out if the
account lockout policy is enabled.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.
