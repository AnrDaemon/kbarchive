The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you want to refresh an offline view, the REQUERY() and REFRESH() functions do
not work. You need to use the Dropoffline command and then create the offline
view again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The REQUERY() and REFRESH() functions, which are typically used to update a
view, result in "Invalid operation for offline view." Also an offline view does
not refresh when you issue the USE ONLINE command. The only way to refresh an
offline view is to drop the view and re-create it. The code below gives you an
example of how to refresh an offline view called MYVIEW that resides in
MYOFFLINE DBC.

WARNING: All uncommitted changes made to the offline view will be lost.

      CLOSE ALL
      SET MULTILOCKS ON
      OPEN DATABASE Myoffline
      =Dropoffline("Myview")
      =Createoffline("Myview")
      USE Myview
      BROWSE

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
