TITLE   :Second PC-Card Hard Disk on Fourth IDE Channel Not Configured
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a computer with two internal IDE channels and two PC-Card type III
slots, Windows NT will not configure the second PC-Card hard disk. When you open
the PC-Card tool in Control Panel and look at the properties of the second disk,
the status in the driver tab will read:

   The driver is installed and started but didn't configure the device.

When you look at the Resources tab, no resources are shown.

CAUSE
=====

The PCMCIA driver in Windows NT does not install a fourth IDE interface. The
current implementation requires that the driver know about possible
configurations. This is different from Windows 95, which supports true Plug and
Play.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be problem in Windows NT 4.0. We are researching
this problem and will post additional information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge base as it becomes available.
