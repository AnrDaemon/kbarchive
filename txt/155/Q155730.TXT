TITLE   :Objects Don't Appear When Viewed in Page on Personal Web Server
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Personal Web Server version 1.0 for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view a page from Personal Web Server, some objects may not be displayed
correctly.

CAUSE
=====

If the server does not know what the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
(MIME) type is for the requested data, it may return an incorrect type (such as
text/plain) that results in an incorrect display of the object.

What Is a MIME Type?
--------------------

MIME types instruct a Web browser (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer) how to
handle files being downloaded from a server. When a Web browser requests an item
on a server, it also requests the MIME type of the object. Some MIME types (such
as graphics) can be displayed inside the browser, while others (such as
animations or document files) must start an external program to display them.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, add the appropriate MIME types to Personal Web
Server.

Steps to Add a MIME Type
------------------------

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you
edit the registry.

The list of configured MIME types is stored in the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\InetInfo\ 
   Parameters\MimeMap

To add a new MIME type, open the MimeMap key and create a new String value. The
name for the new string value should be set for the new MIME type in the
following format:

   <mime/type>,<extension>,<unused>,<unused>

For example, type the following:

   "image/gif,gif,,"

NOTE: The default entries contain settings in the second unused area. These
settings are left over from the Internet Information Server (IIS) codebase,
which Personal Web Server is based on, but they are not used.
