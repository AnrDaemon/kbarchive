TITLE   :WD97: Word Doesn't Find "Float Over Text" Objects
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbualink97 kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Word does not go to, find, or replace some graphics or objects.

CAUSE
=====

The Go To, Find, and Replace features in Word ignore objects for which the Float
Over Text option is selected. Other objects that are also ignored include
WordArt text effects and drawing objects.

NOTE: The Float Over Text property is an option that is selected by default when
you select an object type (Insert, Object).

WORKAROUND
==========

There is no workaround currently available for some object types, such as
WordArt text effects or drawing objects (AutoShapes).

For other objects that have the Float Over Text property, you need to remove this
property before Word can go to, find, or replace the object.

To remove the Float Over Text property and change the object to an inline object,
use one of the following methods:

Method 1: Change the property of the object.
--------------------------------------------

1. Select the picture.

2. On the Format menu, click Object, and then click the Position tab.

3. Click to clear the Float Over Text check box, and then click OK.

Method 2: Convert the object to an inline object.
-------------------------------------------------

1. Select the picture.

2. On the Edit menu, point to Object, and then click Convert.

   NOTE: Object changes to Clip Object or Picture Object, depending on the type
   of object you selected.

3. Click to clear the Float Over Text check box, and then click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
