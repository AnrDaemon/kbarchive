SYMPTOMS
========

If you start the Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA), it may not start,
and one of the following error messages may be displayed:

   Could not start the Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent service on
   \\<servername>
   Error 1067: The process terminated unexpectedly.

   Could not start the Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent service
   on\\<servername>
   Error: 2140: An internal Windows NT error has occurred.

If you use the Windows NT Event Viewer to view the application event log, the
following events are logged:

   Event ID: 137, Source: MSExchangeMTA.
   A fatal directory error occurred. Change to the maximum logging level for more
   details. [MTA MAIN BASE 1 15] (16)

After you change the logging to Maximum (open the properties of the MTA object,
and in the Diagnostics Logging page, click Directory Access and Field
Engineering), the MTA logs one of the following error messages in the Event
Viewer:

   Event Id: 2245, Type: Warning, Category: Directory Access Directory operation
   (ds_read) failed with problem DS_E_NO_SUCH_OBJECT. Attribute . Directory Name
   (string): /O=<organization>
   /OU=<site>/CN=CONFIGURATION/CN=SERVERS/CN=<server
   name>/CN=MICROSOFT MTA. [RD Server MAIN BASE 1 114] (8)

   Event 2241: Directory operation (ds_search) failed with problem
   DS_E_NO_SUCH_OBJECT. Attribute: . Root Directory Name: /
   o=<organization>/ou=<site>/cn=Configuration/cn=Connections. [RD
   Server MAIN BASE 1 116] (12)

CAUSE
=====

The value of the following registry key in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree does
not match the corresponding directory entry:

   System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA\Parameters\X500 DN

The wrong Organization or Site name was used when Exchange Server was reinstalled
on the server.

RESOLUTION
==========

Check the value of the registry key and edit it, if necessary, so that it
matches the corresponding directory entry, or reinstall Exchange Server using
the correct Organization and Site names.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

   System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA\Parameters\X500 DN

3. Check the value for this key. The Organization [o=], Site [ou=], and Server
   Directory names [cn=] must exactly match the properties of the Organization,
   Site, and Server objects as they are displayed in the Exchange Server
   Administrator program.

   To see whether these objects match the value of the registry key:

   a. In the left pane of the Exchange Server Administrator program, click to
      expand the Organization object, click to expand the Site object, and then
      click to expand the Server object.

   b. On the File menu, click Properties. The Directory Name of each of these
      objects must exactly match the corresponding attributes in the registry
      setting described in step 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the Exchange Server MTA starts, it checks the Distinguished Name (DN) of
the MTA object in the registry and verifies that it is exactly the same as the
one that is stored in the Exchange Server directory.
