TITLE   :PRB: "Directory Not Found" When Using Macintosh Client 4.00a
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:4.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe400

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Macintosh, version 4.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When users attempt to execute any command, a "Directory not found" message
appears, and the command is not executed.

CAUSE
=====

The server installation of SourceSafe is on the root of a server volume, such as
<Volume>:

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, move the server installation of Visual SourceSafe to a
folder below the server volume, such as <Volume>:<Folder>:.
Alternatively, you can change the folder level being shared to a higher level
folder at the server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
