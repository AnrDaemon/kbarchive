SUMMARY
=======

The distributed link service is a feature added in Service Pack 1 for Microsoft
SNA Server version 2.11 that allows SNA Servers to be deployed in a new
distributed model, which combines the benefits of the branch and central models
of deployment. For details on the distributed model and link service, please see
the SNA Open Gateway Architecture (SOGA) document.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The original SOGA document indicated that a distributed link service could not
be used by multiple SNA Servers simultaneously. The intent of this was to
prevent you from trying to configure a distributed link service on the local SNA
Server for a local connection. A distributed link service can only be used by
remote SNA Servers. However, it is possible to have multiple remote systems
using a single distributed link service.

To do this, each remote system must be assigned a unique Service Access Point
(SAP). SNA SAPs must be a hexadecimal multiple of four and must be defined on
both ends of the connection. Assuming you had three remote systems you intended
to use the distributed link service, you would use SAPs '04', '08', and '0C'.

The SAPs are defined in the communications line description on the AS/400. Your
AS/400 administrator can help you with this. Using the example of three systems,
you would add '08' and '0C' to the SAPs already defined on the line. SAP '04' is
defined by default.
