SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Driver Setup Kit sample program from ODBC SDK 2.1 with
ODBCCP32.DLL version 2.5, the following error message appears:

   Initialization of the dynamic link library ODBCCP32.DLL failed

CAUSE
=====

ODBCCP32.DLL version 2.5 requires ODBCINT.DLL to load. ODBCINT.DLL is a new
language resource library introduced by ODBC SDK 2.5. All code that needs to be
localized for all ODBC core components have been centralized into this library.
This file includes all error strings and all dialog boxes.

The Driver Setup Kit sample program from ODBC SDK 2.1 is based on the old version
installer DLL, which does not use ODBCINT.DLL. When you install the Drivers from
Desktop Driver Pack 3.0 (which uses the ODBC 2.5 core components), modify the
SETUP.LST file as described below.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Include ODBCINT.DL_ or ODBCINT.DLL in your installation disks.

2. Add the following in the [Files] section of SETUP.LST:

   ODBCINT.DL_  =  ODBCINT.DLL

   -or-

   ODBCINT.DLL  = ODBCINT.DLL

   NOTE: If the file is in compressed format, add the first entry in the [Files]
   section of SETUP.LST. Otherwise, add the second entry.

This enables the Setup program to load ODBCINT.DLL, which is required for the
initialization of ODBCCP32.DLL.
