TITLE   :BUG: ListBox Control Scrolls Slowly
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnokeyword kbvfp300bBUG

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When scrolling with the scroll bar in the ListBox control of Visual FoxPro, the
scrolling speed is unreasonably slow. The Visual FoxPro ListBox may be many
times slower than the @...GET-List of version 2.6. The scrolling speed of the
ListBox is not dependent on the RowSourceType of the control or the size of the
data set being scrolled.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do one of the following to workaround this behavior:

 - Recreate a ListBox-like object by subclassing a grid with the following
   properties:

   ColumnCount = 1
   DeleteMark = .F.
   RecordMark = .F.
   ScrollBars = 2 - Vertical
   HeaderHeight = 0
   GridLines = 0 - None
   RowHeight = FontSize + 2

   The result will be similar in function to a ListBox and will scroll
   considerably faster with the scroll bar. However, if you are using repeated
   arrow keys to scroll, the grid is slower than the ListBox.

   One limitation of this approach is the limited selection of RecordSourceTypes
   of the grid as compared to the RowSourcetypes of the ListBox. The following
   tables illustrate this:

   Grid RecordSourceTypes:

   0 - Table
   1 - Alias
   2 - Prompt
   3 - Query (.QPR)

   ListBox RowSourceTypes:

   0 - None
   1 - Value
   2 - Alias
   3 - SQL Statement
   4 - Query (.QPR)
   5 - Array
   6 - Fields
   7 - Files
   8 - Structure
   9 - Popup

 - Define and activate a POPUP.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following table illustrates the difference in scrolling speed. The test case
used a ListBox sized to show 10 rows and populated with the company field from a
customer table in the Visual FoxPro:Samples:Data folder. The customer table
contains 91 records. The Time column reflects the time necessary to scroll via
the down arrow from top to bottom:
