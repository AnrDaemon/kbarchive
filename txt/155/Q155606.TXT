TITLE   :Windows NT Setup Hangs with NE2000 Installed at Port 340
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbsetup kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the initial text-based portion of Windows NT 4.0 Setup, your
computer may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if an NE2000 network adapter is installed in the
computer using a port address of 340h.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, either change the I/O port to a port other than
340h, or remove the network adapter for the duration of Windows NT Setup.

Windows NT will run properly with the NE2000 network adapter at I/O address 340h
after Setup is finished.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs because of a conflict with the Sparrow.sys driver. This
problem occurs whether or not a SCSI device or adapter is installed.
