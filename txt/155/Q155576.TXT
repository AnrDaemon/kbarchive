TITLE   :WinCim 2.01 Sounds Do Not Play After Rebooting
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install WinCIM 2.01, sound events are associated and work properly
until the system is rebooted. The sounds no longer play after rebooting,
although the events are registered in the Sounds tool and can be played
manually.

CAUSE
=====

WinCIM 2.01 expects to store its sound event information in the Win.ini file,
which is correct for Windows 3.1x. Windows NT migrates this information to the
registry at each reboot, making this information unavailable to WinCIM.


STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
