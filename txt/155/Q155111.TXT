SUMMARY
=======

More than five additional static IP addresses can be entered in the Advanced IP
addressing dialog box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The help text for Windows NT 4.0 TCP/IP states that the TCP/IP Properties can be
"used to specify up to five additional IP addresses and subnet masks for
identifying the selected network adapter...".

In Windows NT 4.0 it is now possible to add more than five additional IP
addresses directly in Control Panel Network on the Advanced page for TCP/IP
Properties.

Under Windows NT 3.51 and earlier, it was only possible to add five additional IP
addresses in Control Panel. Additional IP addresses had to be added through the
registry.
