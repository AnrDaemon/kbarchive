SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses how to modify values that appear in the Role field on the
To Do tab in Schedule+, version 7.0.

The To Do tab contains a Role field, which is a drop-down edit box that enables
you to select from a user-defined list of values. By default, this field is not
displayed, so you must add it to the list of fields before working with it.

To add an entry to the Role field, you can either directly enter it in the field
on the To Do tab or modify it through the Seven Habits Tool. To directly enter
the value, select the Role field, type in a new value, and press ENTER. Follow
the steps below to add or remove an entry from the Role field using the Seven
Habits Tool:

1. On the Tools menu, click the Seven Habits Tool.

2. Click the Roles tab in the Seven Habits Tool dialog box.

3. Highlight the value to add or delete, and click the Add or Delete button.
