TITLE   :XFOR: Misleading Dialog During Restore Using NTBackup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 4.0, 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

When you restore a Microsoft Exchange Server on-line backup using the Windows NT
NTBackup program, and you choose to restore both the Directory and the
Information Store, you will be presented with a Restore Information dialog box
that can be misleading.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Restore Information dialog box allows you to choose various options. If you
are restoring both the Microsoft Exchange Directory and Information Store, you
can scroll down to get the restore information for the Information Store and you
can choose to restore the Information Store to another server.

When the Restore Information dialog first appears, the Destination Server field
cannot be changed. This is the Directory restore information. If you scroll
down, you will then be able to change the Destination Server field. This is the
Information Store restore information. This, in effect, allows you to restore
the backup to restore the Directory to the original server (which is the only
place a Directory can be restored), and to restore the Information Store to
another server. If you don't look carefully at this dialog box, you can be
misled into thinking that you can restore both the Directory and the Information
Store to a different server, which is not the case.
