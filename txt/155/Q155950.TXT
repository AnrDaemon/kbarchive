TITLE   :WD97: Document Map Width Not Retained
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbualink97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you close and reopen a document which contains a Document Map area, the
width returns to the default size. Your custom setting is not retained. In
addition, the width is not carried over when you open additional documents
during the same editing session.

CAUSE
=====

Word automatically sets the Document Map area to one-fourth the width of the
default window. The width of this area is not saved when you save and close a
document.

This is a design limitation of the Document Map.

WORKAROUND
==========

After you open your document, resize the document map pane to the desired width.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The Document Map area is a vertical pane then extends down the left side of the
document window. It displays an outline of the document headings. You can
quickly move through the document by clicking any of the headings in the
Document Map. Word automatically displays the Document Map in Online Layout
View, but you can display it in any view. To do this, click the Document Map
button on the Standard toolbar or click Document Map on the View menu.
