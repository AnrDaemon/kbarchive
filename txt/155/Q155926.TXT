PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0

KEYWORDS:kbmm kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have more than one CD-ROM drive installed, you cannot select the drive
you want to use in Media Player to play an audio CD.

CAUSE
=====

Media Player does not recognize multiple CD-ROM drives.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, use CD Player to play audio CDs. If the AutoRun
feature is enabled in Windows NT, CD Player starts automatically when you insert
an audio CD. If the AutoRun feature is disabled, you can start CD Player by
clicking the Start button, pointing to Programs, pointing to Accessories,
pointing to Multimedia, and then clicking CD Player.
