PowerPoint does not include a half-circle drawing tool. This article discusses

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create a half circle shape in PowerPoint, follow these steps:

1. On the Insert menu, click Chart.

2. On the Format menu, click AutoFormat. Click Pie, and then click option 1.
   This should be a 2-D pie chart.

3. On the View menu, click Datasheet.

4. Clear all cells, except for A1 and B1. In each of those cells type the value
   50.

5. Exit Microsoft Graph.

6. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

7. Insert a new blank slide, and then click Paste Special on the Edit menu.
   Click Picture, and then click OK.

8. On the Draw menu, click Ungroup. You see this message:

   This is an imported object, not a group. Converting it to a PowerPoint
   drawing will discard embedded data or linking information. Convert to
   PowerPoint drawing?

   Click OK.

You now have 2 half circles on the slide. Choose the half circle you want and
copy it to the appropriate slide.
