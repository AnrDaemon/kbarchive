SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to use the FrontPage Registration WebBot in on a Web site running the
Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) or Microsoft Personal Web Server,
you may receive the following error message when viewing the properties of the
page:

   This server does not support registered end users.

CAUSE
=====

Internet Information Server and Microsoft Personal Web Server do not allow users
to register through a browser for access to a Web.

MORE INFORMATION
================

IIS requires that all users, authors, and administrators of a FrontPage Web have
valid Windows NT accounts. User accounts can only be created by a Windows NT
administrator using User Manager. The HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) does
not support creating user accounts.

When you create a registration Web, you ask the server to create and update a
list of registered users based on input from HTTP browsers. IIS is not designed
to support the creation of registered users without creating a corresponding
Windows NT account.

For additional information about how to create a registration page for use with
Web servers that support this feature, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
