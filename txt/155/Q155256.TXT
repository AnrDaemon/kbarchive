TITLE   :IIS 2.0 on Windows NT 4.0 BDC Does Not Create IUSER
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you set up Internet Information Server (IIS) while you run the Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0 Setup program on a new BDC (not an upgrade), the IUSER_<BDC
Machine Name> is not created. Therefore, you cannot connect to any of the
Internet services on that BDC.

CAUSE
=====

The IIS Setup program creates the IUSER_<BDC Machine Name> account during
its installation. Because the BDC does not have access to the domain user
database until after the BDC is rebooted, the IUSER_<BDC Machine Name> is
not created. The user will show up under the Internet Server Manager; however,
because the account does not exist in the domain database, users cannot connect
to the BDCs Internet services.

NOTE: This only happens when you install IIS during Windows NT 4.0 Setup on a new
BDC. This does not effect upgrades.

WORKAROUND
==========

After you restart the BDC after you install IIS, remove IIS from the BDC and
re-install it.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Server version 2.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
