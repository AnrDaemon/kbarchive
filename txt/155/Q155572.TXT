TITLE   :REM Does Not Prevent Parsing of FOR Statement in Batch File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If there is a syntax error in a line that uses the FOR command, that error is
displayed, even if the line is preceded with the REM statement. For example, the
following command line

   rem FOR /R %z in (*.txt) do d:\test %~nxz

results in an error message being displayed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you do not want the error to appear, make sure the syntax is correct, even if
the line is preceded with the REM statement. Using the example above, change the
line to:

   rem FOR /R %z in (*.txt) do d:\test %%~nxz
