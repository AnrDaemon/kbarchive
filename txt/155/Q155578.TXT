TITLE   :Computer May Not Boot with CD-ROM Installed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to boot a Compaq Prosignia server with a CD-ROM in the first
CD-ROM drive, the computer may stop responding while waiting for the CD-ROM to
boot. The computer does not boot until the CD-ROM is removed from the drive.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can be caused by a system BIOS firmware or configuration problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the boot sequence in the computer's CMOS settings to boot first from the
hard disk, then from drive A, and then from the CD-ROM drive.

If the computer hangs with the CD-ROM installed, but boots when the CD-ROM is
removed, the system's firmware does not fully support booting from a CD-ROM.
Contact the manufacturer to obtain a firmware upgrade.
