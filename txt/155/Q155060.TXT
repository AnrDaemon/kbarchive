SUMMARY
=======

The Simple MAPI C function, MAPIAddress, does not dynamically allocate memory,
as suggested in the MAPI Software Developer's Kit (SDK) online documentation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MAPI SDK online documentation states the following for the lppNewRecips
parameter of the MAPIAddress function:

   lppNewRecips
   Output parameter pointing to an array of MapiRecipDesc structures containing
   the final list of recipients. This array is allocated by MAPIAddress...

This description implies that the MAPIAddress function allocates an array for the
MapiRecipDesc structures. This is not accurate. In order to use this function
properly, you must allocate memory for the array with a MALLOC statement in your
code. If you do not do this, you may receive an exception error in Kernel32.dll
and/or a MAPI_E_FAILURE error when using the MAPIAddress function.
