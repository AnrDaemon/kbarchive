TITLE   :PPT7: Saving in 4.0 Fails if Path Longer Than 100 Characters
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbdta kbconversion

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you save a PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 presentation in
PowerPoint 4.0 format, you receive the following message if the filename
(including the path) you choose is longer than 100 characters:

   Sorry, either the file name is too long or PowerPoint cannot find or run the
   Viewer, which it needs to save in PowerPoint 4.0 format. If the file name is
   correct, you should run Setup and reinstall to get the Viewer.

Saving the same file as a PowerPoint 7.0 presentation to the same path and
filename works correctly.

CAUSE
=====

This is because when saving as a PowerPoint 4.0 file, PowerPoint uses the
Pptview.dll, which is a 16-bit DLL. PowerPoint has to shorten the filename
before passing it to the Viewer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, save the file in PowerPoint 7.0 format, or save it
to a folder that has a shorter path.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft
PowerPoint 97 for Windows.

Additional query words: 7.00 long filename 256 limitation
