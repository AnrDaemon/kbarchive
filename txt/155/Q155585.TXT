TITLE   :XADM: Error 1069 When Starting an Exchange Service
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg kbnetwork kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start one of the Microsoft Exchange services, the following error
message might appear:

   Could not start the Microsoft Exchange <service name> on <server
   name>
   Error 1069: The service did not start due to logon failure.

CAUSE
=====

In Control Panel Services in the Startup options for the service receiving the
error, the "Log On As: This Account" option either has the wrong password or the
account no longer exists.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the Service Account's password is not known and the services will not start
and return an error 1069, you must run Windows NT User Manager for Domains and
change the Service Account password.

After changing the Service Account password, you will need to start the Microsoft
Exchange Administrator program and perform the following steps:

Note: To run the Administrator program you will have to start the Microsoft
Exchange System Attendant service and the Microsoft Exchange Directory service,
and quite possibly will have to change the password in the Startup options on
these services.

1. Highlight the Configuration container.

2. On the File menu, click Properties.

3. Click the Service Account Password tab.

4. Enter and confirm the new password.

5. Click Apply.

In addition, you need to change the Service Account password on any service
account override pages on Microsoft Exchange Servers in other Sites.

For more information about change the Service Account password, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q157780 XADM How to Change the Service Account Password

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can confirm that this is the problem by logging off the Windows NT Domain
and attempting to log back on to the domain as the Service Account.

If you can log on to the Domain as the Service Account, change the password in
the Startup option to the reflect the same password you entered.
