KEYWORDS:kbhw win95 kbHardwarekbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SCSI devices may not be enumerated correctly, especially when there are multiple
buses upon which the devices may be located. Configuration Manager may not
display SCSI devices that are installed.

CAUSE
=====

There is a problem in the Scsiport.pdr file, in which the bus number is not
correctly reported to the dependent miniport drivers. Instead, Scsiport.pdr
always reports a bus number of 0.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.
