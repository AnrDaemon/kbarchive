SUMMARY
=======

The new SELECT ... INTO CURSOR ... NOFILTER clause causes a cursor to be created
that has a corresponding physical file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In previous versions of FoxPro, the following code generates an error:

      SELECT * FROM customer INTO Cursor temp
      SELECT * FROM temp INTO Cursor temp2

The following error, 1815, is generated:

   'TEMP' must be created with SELECT...INTO TABLE.

The following code was frequently used as a workaround in previous versions of
FoxPro:

      SELECT *,.T. FROM customer INTO Cursor temp
      SELECT * FROM temp INTO Cursor temp2

The extra column created by the .T. causes a physical file to be created, which
can have subsequent SELECT - SQL statements run against it.

In FoxPro 5.0, you can use the following code instead:

      SELECT * FROM customer INTO Cursor temp NOFILTER
      SELECT * FROM temp INTO Cursor temp2

The NOFILTER clause forces the SELECT to create a physical file that can have
SELECT - SQL statements run against it, without adding more columns.

When the cursor is closed, the physical (temp) file is deleted.
