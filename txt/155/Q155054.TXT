SYMPTOMS
========

Visual SourceSafe will sometimes save a Visual Basic form's binary file (.FRX)
as text rather than binary, depending on the objects placed on the Visual Basic
form.

If this "text" version of the .FRX file is checked out, and the program is run or
the form is modified, an "Illegal Operation" error will result in either
OLE32.DLL, SSSCC.DLL or KERNEL32.DLL.

NOTE: This problem is not reproducible in Visual Basic 4.0a/Visual SourceSafe
4.0a.

RESOLUTION
==========

To force a particular file type to be treated as binary, the following line
should be added to the SRCSAFE.INI file on the server:

      Binary_Masks = *.frx

This .INI information can be added by using the "File Types" tab found by
choosing Options from the Tools menu.
