======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you change the MousePointer property of a Grid object to 14-Arrow, Visual
FoxPro produces the following error message:

   Expression evaluated to an illegal value.

WORKAROUND
==========

Rather than changing the MousePointer property of the Grid object to 14- Arrow,
choose 1-Arrow. The properties are the same, but 1-Arrow does not produce an
error message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form and add a Grid object to it.

2. Click the MousePointer property of the Grid object and change it to 14-Arrow.
   The error message "Expression evaluated to an illegal value" appears.

3. Change the MousePointer property to 1-Arrow. The error does not occur.
