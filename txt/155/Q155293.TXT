======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The time displayed in the status bar of the development environment in Visual
C++ is off by one hour.

CAUSE
=====

The run-time library and tools in Visual C++ use "daylight saving time"
information from the TZ environment variable if it is set.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not set the TZ environment variable, instead use the Date/Time applet in the
Control Panel in Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows
Millennium Edition (Me). Check the AUTOEXEC.BAT file or other places where you
may have set the TZ environment variable. If you really need to set it, set it
to be the same as the operating system settings. For more information about TZ
environment variable, please refer to _tzset function in the Run-Time Library
Reference.
