TITLE   :Writer 2: Spaces to the Right of Right Margin Behave Strangely
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Kids Products
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Spaces to the right where the right margin is located appear to vanish when you
attempt to select them with the mouse.

The following are situations in which you might observe this behavior:

1. The space is the last character on any line.

2. There is an entire line with only spaces.

The behavior may cause some confusion for Microsoft Word users because selecting
spaces in Microsoft Word operates differently than in Creative Writer 2.0.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Open a new document.

2. Type a series of words until after you reach the end of the line.

3. Click in the area immediately to the right of the last word on the first
   line.

4. Press the SPACEBAR several times.

5. Click in the area to the right of the right margin. (Notice that any spaces
   to the right of the right margin appear to have vanished, and you cannot
   select the other spaces.)

6. Press the RIGHT ARROW key to confirm that there are spaces to the right of
   the cursor.
