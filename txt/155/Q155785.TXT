TITLE   :CG3: Colors Turn to Gray in Thumbnail Images
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER::3.0; WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Clip Gallery for Windows 95, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Publisher 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you add clips to Microsoft Clip Gallery, some of the colors in the clip may
show up as gray in the thumbnail for that clip. This problem may occur if your
Display properties are set for some color depth other than 256 colors.

For more information about changing the color depth of your display, search on
the word "colors" (without the quotation marks), and then view the "Changing the
number of colors your monitor displays" topic, using the Windows 95 Help Index.

RESOLUTION
==========

This symptom only affects the thumbnail preview for the clip. When you insert
the clip into a publication or document, that clip will appear with the correct
colors.

If the gray makes the thumbnail unusable, delete it, change your color depth to
256 colors, and then add the clip to Clip Gallery again.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
