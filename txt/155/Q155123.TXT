SUMMARY
=======

When Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 detects your modem automatically, the
modem may be detected as a standard modem.

MORE INFORMATION

A modem may be detected as a standard modem even though it is a supported modem
for which Windows NT Workstation 4.0 contains a driver.

If a supported modem is detected as a standard modem, it will function correctly
if you manually select the correct driver.
