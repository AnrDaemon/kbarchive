TITLE   :XADM: IMC Can't Decode Mail That Uses the EUC-KR Charset
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector(IMC) will fail to decode messages
sent from Netscape using the EUC-KR character set (charset).

CAUSE
=====

This fails because of a conflict in charsets. When the IMC translates Korean
messages, it uses the ISO-2022-KR charset, however, Netscape uses the EUC-KR
charset.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
