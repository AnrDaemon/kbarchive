TITLE   :XCLN: Message Field Elements not Propagated to EFD Form

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

When you open a message that has been created to emulate a Microsoft Electronic
Forms Designer (EFD) message using either Microsoft OLE Messaging or MAPI 1.0,
the form displayed when opening the submitted message may not propagate the
fields collection data in the form. Therefore, the form controls appear blank.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The forms designer requires that the MS_EXCHANGE_01 property be set to True.
This property determines whether the initial values have been passed in. If this
value is set to False (the default), EFD will display the initial values for the
form (most of which are blank). These initial values are actually overwriting
the values stored in the message object.

The MS_EXCHANGE_01 property needs to be defined as true in the code for each
message that is created.

Example:

      Private Sub Command2_Click()
      Dim objSession As Object
      Dim objMessage As Object
      Dim objField As Object
      'Dim objOneMsg As Object
      Dim objOneRecip As Object
      Const kCreatedProp = "MS_EXCHANGE_01"

      Set objSession = CreateObject("MAPI.Session")
      'Logon
      objSession.Logon

      Set objMessage = objSession.Inbox.Messages.Add
      'Create the message properties
      objMessage.Subject = "EFD message"
      objMessage.Type = "IPM.MyForm.Cool"   'Installed EFD type
      'Set the message fields
      Set objField = objMessage.Fields.Add("Entry1", vbString)
      objField.Value = "The latest Stuff"
      Set objField = Nothing
      Set objField = objMessage.Fields.Add("Entry2", vbString)
      objField.Value = "Additional NewStuff"
      Set objField = Nothing
      Set objField = objMessage.Fields.Add(kCreatedProp, vbBoolean, True)
      Set objField = Nothing
      'Set the message recip
      Set objOneRecip = objMessage.Recipients.Add
      objOneRecip.Name = "John Doe"
      objOneRecip.Type = 1
      objOneRecip.Resolve

      objMessage.Update

      objSession.Logoff
      End Sub
