SYMPTOMS
========

When you eject the Monster Truck Madness compact disc while running the game,
the system stops responding (hangs) if you installed the game using either the
Compact or Typical installation option.

If you chose the Compact option during setup, you should not eject the Monster
Truck Madness CD while the game is running. If you do so, Monster Truck Madness
hangs.

If you chose the Typical option during setup, you must have the Monster Truck
Madness CD in your CD-ROM drive to play the game's opening movie, victory
scenes, and the online Help movies. Ejecting the CD while of any of these movies
is playing may cause your system to hang.

Additional query words: Monster Truck Madness compact disc take out cd-rom remove cd
