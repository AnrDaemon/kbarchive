TITLE   :WD97: Copies Not Reset to One After Selecting Different Printer
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows

KEYWORDS:kbualink97

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you open the Print dialog box and select a different printer, the Copies
option is not reset to 1. This problem occurs when all of the following are
true:

 - You have at least two printers installed. One printer has the Copies property
   set to a number greater than one; the other printer has the Copies property
   set to one.

 - You print first to the printer that has the Copies property set to a number
   greater than one.

 - You then print to the printer which has the Copies property set to one.

CAUSE
=====

The File Print dialog box is not updated properly when you select the second
printer from the list box. For example, if you first print to a printer set up
to print three copies and then switch to a second printer that is set up to
print one copy, the Copies option shows three copies instead of one copy.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the Copies option to one after you select
the second printer.
