-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Word's picture editor to edit a non-rectangular object created in
PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 that contains one of PowerPoint's custom
fills, the fill takes on a rectangular shape outside of the original object's
boundaries.

CAUSE
=====

This happens to non-rectangular PowerPoint 7.0 objects when they contain fills
that are not solid colors or patterns. This happens when the PowerPoint 7.0
object is copied and pasted, or dragged and dropped into a Word 7.0 document.
The picture editor in Word does not correctly process the custom fills created
by PowerPoint tools.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you need to edit a non-rectangular PowerPoint drawing object, copy and paste
it into PowerPoint. Edit the object in PowerPoint, then copy and paste it back
into your Word document.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word for Windows 95,
version 7.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
