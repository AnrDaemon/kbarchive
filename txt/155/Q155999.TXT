SUMMARY
=======

The following is an overview of the Deadly Tide game. This information is from
the Deadly Tide Readme.txt file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Your objective is to save Earth from the alien threat. To ensure success:

 - Shoot everything that shoots at you or that has a yellow bracket around it.

 - Keep an eye on your HUD, and closely monitor your weapon temperature gauge
   and shield integrity indicator. The first instrument determines when you're
   about to lose your weapon power. The second indicates when you're about to
   die.

 - There are two modes of play. In flight mode, Navigational Control handles
   your steering. In rotate mode, your forward movement stops and you can rotate
   as if in a sphere. Both modes are signaled by the rotate/flight indicator on
   your HUD. Use your joystick to aim and fire!

 - And never forget: The EOA is counting on you!
