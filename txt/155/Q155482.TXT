KEYWORDS:kbgraphic kbinterop kbole

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a PowerPoint 7.0 drawing object has a pattern fill and you bring the object
into Word 7.0 to edit with Word's picture editor, the fill retains the object's
shape but the pattern becomes a solid color.

CAUSE
=====

This happens to PowerPoint 7.0 objects that have a pattern fill and are copied
and pasted, or drag and dropped, into Word 7.0. The picture editor in Word does
not correctly process the pattern fills created by PowerPoint tools.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you must edit a pattern-filled drawing object, copy it back into PowerPoint
to make the changes. Then you can copy and paste the object back into your Word
document.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word for Windows 95,
version 7.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
