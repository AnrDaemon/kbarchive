TITLE   :PPT7: Lines on Handouts Page Vary in Thickness When Printed
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbdta kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When printing handouts (3 per page), Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95,
version 7.0 automatically places lines on the right-hand side of the printout.
You may find that the line thickness varies from page to page, or even within a
page. There are no menu options to control or disable this feature.

CAUSE
=====

The thickness of the lines on Handouts is influenced by the bottom slide image
on each Handouts page. The color and line thickness of the line or border that
is closest to the front of the 3rd slide image controls the thickness of the
lines on the right side of the page.

RESOLUTION
==========

One way of controlling this behavior is to place a line or bordered object of
the desired thickness and color on every 3rd slide, then use the Bring to Front
command on the Draw menu to bring the object to the front of the stack of
objects on that slide.

The line may be hidden within a thicker line of the same color, if desired, but
must not be obscured by a filled object.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
