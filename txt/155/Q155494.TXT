SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Internet Information Server (IIS) Internet Database Connector
(IDC) to query large databases, for example, a Microsoft SQL Server, a large
amount of data may be returned causing the browser to hang for long periods of
time.

CAUSE
=====

If the query used is very general, a large number of records may be returned
from the database. For example, Microsoft SQL Server can return up to 4 billion
records from a single query. In most cases, this could be a large portion of the
database. Various browsers will react differently because a large amount of data
will be received.

WORKAROUND
==========

To prevent browser overload, use the MaxRecords parameter in the .IDC file that
you are using to make the database query. For example,

Datasource: Web SQL
Username: sa
MaxRecords: 100
Template: query.htx
SQLStatement:
+SELECT FirstName, LastName
+FROM Guests ...

In this example, MaxRecords would limit the records returned to 100.
