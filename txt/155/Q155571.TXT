TITLE   :Can Install Incompatible Program Using the .inf File

SUMMARY
=======

It is possible, by using the program's .inf file, to install a program that
would not normally allow itself to be set up using its Setup program. If a
program has been designed to be installed in Windows 95 only, the program's
Setup program may warn you that the program is not designed to run with Windows
NT. However, you may be able to use the right mouse button to click the
program's .inf file and then click Install. Doing so can cause problems, as
system files may be overwritten with incompatible versions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Check the documentation for the program regarding proper installation
instructions.

An .inf file is, in its simplest form, a Windows batch file that allows for
customizing the Setup process. It is not uncommon for companies to distribute
their programs with these type of files. Because .inf files include commands
that can be executed, it is always a good idea to double- check the
documentation for the program to see if installation using the .inf file is
supported.
