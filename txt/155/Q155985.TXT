-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a macro that saves a file with a file name that uses a character
outside of the range 32-255, based on the Unicode standard, the following
Microsoft Visual Basic message appears:

   Run-time error '5152
   This is not a valid file name. Try one or more of the following:

   *Check the path to make sure it was typed correctly.
   *Select a file from the list of files and folders.
   <path>\<file name>.

where <path> is a folder name and <file name> is a file name on the
computer.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Microsoft Windows 95 is not aware of the Unicode
standard.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use characters from the standard American National
Standards Institute (ANSI) character set when naming files with a macro.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Unicode standard is a world-wide, 16-bit character encoding system. It is a
fixed-width, uniform text and character encoding scheme that includes characters
from the world's scripts, as well as technical symbols in common use. It is
maintained by the Unicode Consortium and corresponds with international standard
ISO/IEC 10646-1:1993.

One use for characters outside the range is to represent accented characters in
foreign languages.
