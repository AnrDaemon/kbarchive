SYMPTOMS
========

General Protection Faults (GPF) may occur during the setup under the 16-bit OS
installations of Visual SourceSafe 4.0.

There are two problems that may occur:

1. Installing Visual SourceSafe while attempting to give focus to another
   application may cause the following:

   * ACMSETUP GPF in MACH.DRV, or a GPF in KRNL386.EXE.

2. Inserting the wrong disk numerous times during a floppy disk install of
   Visual SourceSafe Setup may cause the following:

   * GPF in GDI.EXE, or Windows For Workgroups to hang.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem, reboot and ensure that no other applications are
running. Then try reinstalling SourceSafe.
