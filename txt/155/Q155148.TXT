TITLE   :Writer 2: Start New Page Places Cursor After Insertion Line
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Kids Products
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you click the Start New Page button, the cursor is placed after the
paragraph to which you applied the tool.

The behavior may cause some confusion for Microsoft Word users because the Insert
Page tool in Word operates differently from the equivalent tool in Creative
Writer 2.0.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start Creative Writer 2.0.

2. Open A Blank Page.

3. Type the following and press ENTER after each line:

   "1" (without the quotation marks)
   "2" (without the quotation marks)
   "3" (without the quotation marks)

4. On the Page menu, click Start New Page.

5. Apply the new page to the number 2 by clicking it in the document.

RESULT: The cursor is placed just before the number 3 (which skipped the
paragraph that contained the number 2 was on).

NOTE: If there is only one line on each page, the above behavior may result in
skipping an entire page of text.
