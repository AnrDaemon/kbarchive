 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you click the "Enable shutdown from the Authentication dialog box" check box
in System Policy Editor (Poledit.exe) so that it is selected, the Shutdown
button in the Logon Information dialog box is enabled in both Windows NT 4.0
Server and Workstation. If you clear the "Enable shutdown from the
Authentication dialog box" check box, the Shutdown button is disabled in both
Windows NT 4.0 Server and Workstation.

By default, the Shutdown button is disabled in Windows NT Server and enabled in
Windows NT Workstation. If you change the setting, you cannot restore the
default setting.

CAUSE
=====

System Policy Editor does not have an option to restore the default setting.

RESOLUTION
==========

Using System Policy Editor, manually connect to each computer for which you want
to enable or disable the Shutdown button setting, and change the setting as
needed.
