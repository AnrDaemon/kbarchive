Monster Truck Madness Can't Play Videos in Windows NT 4.0

correctly and completely install Monster Truck Madness on a
Windows NT 4.0 machine.

Log on as the Administrator, or talk to your system administrator
to change your permissions. Then, run Indeo setup from the compact
disc. Indeo setup is located on the Monster Truck Madness CD-ROM in:

   \Setup\Indeo\Setup.exe

Compact Install Requires the Monster Truck Madness CD

If you chose the Compact option during Setup, you will need to run
Monster Truck Madness with the compact disc in your CD-ROM drive.

the game stops responding (hangs). Please quit Monster Truck Madness
before ejecting the Monster Truck Madness compact disc.
