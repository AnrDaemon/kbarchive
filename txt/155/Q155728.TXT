SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the File And Printer Sharing For NetWare Networks service,
changing the share access rights for a user also changes the rights for a group
with the same name.

CAUSE
=====

Although users and groups are listed separately in the access control list for
the share, only the name is referenced when a change is made. If you change the
access rights for a user, the access rights for a group with the same name are
changed. If you change the access rights for a group, the access rights for a
user with the same name are changed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, change the name of a group or user so there are no
duplicate names.
