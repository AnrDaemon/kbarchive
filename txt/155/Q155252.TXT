TITLE   :Host Name to IP Address Redirection in an IIS URL
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:1.0 2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 1.0, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A client browser accessing a Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), using
a fully qualified domain name in the URL such as

   HTTP://myserver.mycompany.com

or a host/computer name such as

   HTTP://myserver

may result in a URL redirection of host name to IP address, for example

   HTTP://ipaddress

where ipaddress is your host server's IP address.

WORKAROUND
==========

Below are several ways to work around this issue: two methods to minimize this
issue in IIS 1.0, a way to resolve it in IIS 2.0, and a way to resolve the issue
by changing the registry of IIS.

Host name to IP address redirection may occur on an IIS version 1.0 or 2.0
server. This issue can be resolved on an IIS version 2.0 server that is accessed
by a browser client that also supports the use of Host Headers and can be
minimized on an IIS 1.0 server or client browser that does not support the use
of Host Headers.

To minimize the IP address redirection on an IIS 1.0 server, use the complete
path to the HTML file in the URL, for example:

   HTTP://myserver.mycompany.com/samples/default.htm.

-or-

End the URL with a forward slash, for example:

   HTTP://myserver.mycompany.com/samples/.

However, the issue may still occur on IIS 1.0.

To resolve the issue in IIS2.0, use Host Headers. Host Headers can help prevent
the unexpected substitution of the the IP address for the host name in the URL.
Browsers such as the Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0 also support the
use of Host Headers.

The web master can also make a change to the registry of the IIS 2.0 server to
help prevent the IP address redirection on older browser clients. The new
registry entry is ReturnURLUsingHostName; its use is described below.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Carry out "Net Stop w3svc".

2. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

3. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

      \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3svc\Parameters
  

   The parameter described below is located under this registry subkey.

   The following describes a new value for the W3SVC service parameters tree,
   which can only be set by adding an entry in the Registry Editor. This
   parameter does not appear by default in the registry, so you must add an
   entry if you want to change its default value. The W3SVC service must be
   restarted for changes to take effect.

      ReturnURLUsingHostName
         Data Type = REG_DWORD
         Value:

   Enter a value of 1.

   The default value is 0. This returns the IIS server's IP address to a client
   browser when doing redirects if the Host Header field is not present.

   A value of 1 returns a fully qualified domain name or the host/computer name
   of the IIS server.

   If a fully qualified domain name has been added in the Domain box of the DNS
   dialog box, the server will return that name; otherwise, it will return the
   server's computer name, which appears in the Host Name box by default.

4. To fill in a fully qualified domain name, open the TCP/IP property sheet in
   the Network tool of the Windows NT Control Panel. Click the DNS tab, and type
   your domain name in the Domain box, for example mycompany.com.

5. Carry out "Net Start w3svc".
