SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses behavior you may encounter when using some joysticks and
controllers with Monster Truck Madness. This information is from the Monster
Truck Madness Readme.txt file.

JOYSTICKS THAT HAVE A HAT SWITCH

Some joysticks that have a hat switch exhibit the following
behavior:

When two joystick buttons are pressed simultaneously, the joystick
interprets the multiple presses as a hat switch action. To prevent
this, press only one joystick button at a time. Or, customize your
joystick controls. For details on customizing your joystick, see
the Monster Manual (online Help).

IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE JOYSTICK INSTALLED ON YOUR COMPUTER

Monster Truck Madness only recognizes the joystick configured as
Joystick 1 in the Windows 95 Joystick Properties dialog box. If
you have more than one joystick, be sure that the joystick you
want to use is configured as Joystick 1. For more information
on choosing a primary driving control, see the Monster Manual
(online Help).

IF YOU ARE USING THE THRUSTMASTER T1 OR T2 RACE CAR CONTROLLER

If you are using the ThrustMaster T1 or T2 race car controller
   Make sure you are using the axis converter provided by
   ThrustMaster. This will ensure that both the steering and the
   pedals appear on the same joystick. If you do not have an axis
   converter, contact ThrustMaster to obtain one. The axis converter
   plugs into your joystick port; you then plug your controller into
   the port.

Calibrate your controller from the Windows 95 Control Panel.

Start Monster Truck Madness.

On the Options menu, click Controls.

Select Race Car Controller as your primary driving control.

Click Calibrate, and then follow the instructions on your screen.

For more information about contacting ThrustMaster, see the Monster
Manual (online Help).
