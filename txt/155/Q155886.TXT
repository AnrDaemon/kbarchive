TITLE   :Domain Controller Not Found When Using DNS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You have configured your Windows NT Workstation or Member Server to participate
in a domain. You only have a domain controller across an IP router and you
resolve the name of the domain with Domain Name System (DNS). As soon as
possible, log on. You can also configure the computer for AutoAdminLogon.

After some time you receive the message that a domain controller cannot be found.
If you have logged on before, you will be logged on using cached information. If
you log off and try to log on, after a while, you will be able to log on
successfully.

CAUSE
=====

When Windows NT starts, the network services begin when the dialog box "Press
Ctrl+Alt+Del to log on" appears. The component in Windows NT that sends DNS
requests starts later in this process, so the logon process runs into a time-out
and stops waiting for the connection to the domain controller.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using the Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of the Registry Editor
can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

Add the "Group" value type REG_MULI_SZ with the entry "TDI" under the following
two registry keys:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM

      \CurrentControlSet
         \Services
            \LMHOSTS

and

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM

      \CurrentControlSet
         \Services
            \TCPIP

This information does not apply to Windows NT 4.0 because the needed registry
entries exist by default.
