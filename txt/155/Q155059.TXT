======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++.NET (2002) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a machine with Visual C++ installed, when you try to place an ActiveX (OLE)
control on a dialog box template, you see a message box stating:

   The ActiveX control "<The control inserted>" could not be instantiated
   because it requires a design-time license.

CAUSE
=====

There are two known causes for this message being displayed:

 - Installing Visual C++ with USER privileges causes this problem because it
   prevents the installation of Visual C++ from adding several entries in the
   Registry.
 - The registry is corrupted.


The controls that may display this problem include: Anibutton, COMMON DIALOGS,
Desaware Mlist, Grid, ImageList, Key State, Lead Std, ListView, Microsoft Comm,
Microsoft MAPI Message, Microsoft MAPI Session, Microsoft Masked Edit, Microsoft
Multimedia, Microsoft Rich Textbox, MSDataCombo, MSDataList, Outline, PicClip,
PICS Data Edit, Pinnacle-BPS Graph, ProgressBar, ProtoView Diagramming
Control(IDO), Sax Basic Engine Control - Foundation, Sheridan Tabbed Dialog,
Slider, SpinButton, Stack, StatusBar, Stylus Visual Voice for TAPI, TabStrip,
THREED CHECKBOX, THREED COMMAND BUTTON, THREED FRAME, THREED GROUP PUSH BUTTON,
THREED OPTION BUTTON, THREED PANEL, Toolbar, TreeView, VideoPlay.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, reinstall Visual C++. If you are installing on a
Windows NT or Windows 2000 computer, then you must be logged on as an
administrator. If your registry has been corrupted, install all software that
may have been affected, including the operating system if necessary.
