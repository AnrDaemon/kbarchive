PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start any of the Internet Information Server (IIS) services,
such as the World Wide Web, Gopher, or FTP Server services in the Internet
Service Manager, the service does not start nor does it give a message
indicating a problem.

If you double-click on the computer name in the Internet Service Manager, the
following message appears:

   Unable to connect to target machine.

Trying to start any of the IIS services with the Services tool in Control Panel,
results in the following error message:

   Could not start the (FTP, Gopher, or World Wide Web) Publishing Service
   service on \\computername

   Error 1075: The dependency service does not exist or has been marked for
   deletion.

No messages are logged in the event log.

CAUSE
=====

The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Service is not installed. All of the IIS
services depend on the RPC Service.

Additionally, if the TCP/IP protocol is not installed, the same symptoms result.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Network icon.

2. Select Add Software and then install "RPC Configuration."

3. If TCP/IP is not installed, install it using the Network tool in Control
   Panel, as described above.
