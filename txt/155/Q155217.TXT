   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to enable or disable automatically running CD-ROMs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

If there is a CD-ROM changer attached to your computer, you may want to disable
automatically running CD-ROMs (the automatic running of a compact disc [CD] or
the automatic playing of an audio CD-ROM). If automatically running CD-ROMs is
enabled with a CD-ROM changer, each time that you insert a new CD-ROM into one
of the trays, Windows cycles through every tray in the changer.

There is no option to enable or disable automatically running CD-ROMs in the user
interface. To enable or disable automatically running CD-ROMs, you must edit the
registry:

1. Click Start, click Run, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks) in the
   Open box, and then press ENTER.

2. Locate and click the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\CDRom

3. To disable automatically running CD-ROMs, change the Autorun value to 0
   (zero). To enable automatically running CD-ROMs, change the Autorun value to
   1.

4. Restart your computer.

NOTE: This method disables automatically running CD-ROMs. If you want to disable
automatically running CD-ROMs depending on the CD-ROM that you insert in the
CD-ROM drive, you can press and hold down one of the SHIFT key while you insert
the CD-ROM.


Additional Information
----------------------

There are two other registry keys that can affect this functionality:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer
   NoDriveTypeAutoRun = 0x00000095

   -and-

   HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer
   NoDriveTypeAutoRun = 0x00000095

The correct value for each is 0x00000095.
