======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Server Manager or the "NET USE /D" command to stop sharing a
shared, administrative folder (such as ADMIN$ or C$), users are unable to access
files or folders on the shared location.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can re-establish the share by using one of the following procedures:

 - Type the following commands from a command prompt:

   net share sharename$

 - If you run Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, you can also use System Policy Editor
   (Poledit.exe) to specify the "Create hidden drive shares" option in the
   Computer\Windows NT Network\Sharing\Create hidden drive shares folder.

 - Restart the computer.

These shares behave as standard administrative shares. For example, you cannot
configure permissions on them.

Additional query words: recreate
