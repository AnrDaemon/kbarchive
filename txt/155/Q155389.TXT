SUMMARY
=======

Visual FoxPro 5.0 and 6.0 allow you to convert between hexadecimal and decimal
values using Xbase code.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual FoxPro 5.0 and 6.0 help you easily convert between decimal and
hexadecimal numbers. The following examples demonstrate how to gain decimal
output from a hexadecimal number. Type the following lines in the Command
window:

      x = 0xff
      WAIT WINDOW STR(x)
      y = 0xefff
      WAIT WINDOW STR(y)

The WAIT WINDOW commands report the numbers 255 and 61439. The zero and the x
(0x) in front of the hexadecimal value tells Visual FoxPro to treat the
proceeding values as hexadecimal values.

Additionally, the TRANSFORM() function has a new clause to handle hexadecimal
conversions. The following TRANSFORM() functions demonstrate this new
functionality. Type the following code in the Command window:

      ? TRANSFORM(x,"@0")
      ? TRANSFORM(y,"@0")

The TRANSFORM() function converts the decimal values back to hexadecimal form.
The zero (0) format code directs the TRANSFORM() function to output hexadecimal
numbers. The output is always an eight-digit hexadecimal value preceded by 0x.

While these new capabilities are easy to use, earlier versions of FoxPro do not
have this functionality. If you need backward-compatible code that converts
decimals to hexadecimal values, create a function within Visual FoxPro using the
CONVERT() function.
