TITLE   :FPNW Utility to Set Up Subauthentication on Domain Controller
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In a master domain model, if the File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW)
server is installed in a resource domain and the user accounts reside in the
accounts domain, you can use the Fpnwauth.exe utility to enable the domain
controllers in the accounts domain to authenticate logon attempts by FPNW users
from NetWare client computers.

However, on a "tools only" install of FPNW, there is not a way to set up
subauthentication on a domain controller.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
