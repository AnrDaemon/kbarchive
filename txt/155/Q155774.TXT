TITLE   :WD97: Framed Object Positioned Incorrectly in Online Layout View
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbualink97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view your document using online layout view, the text wraps differently
and the framed objects appear in a different position than when you view your
document using either print preview or page layout view. In addition, the text
and objects are positioned differently when you print your document.

CAUSE
=====

Online layout view is designed to optimize the layout of the document to make it
easier for online reading. For example, text appears larger and wraps to fit the
window. In contrast, page layout and print preview are designed to give you an
idea of how your document will look when you print it.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you do not plan to use your document online and you want to view how it will
look when you print it, select either Print Preview (on the File menu) or Page
Layout (on the View menu).
