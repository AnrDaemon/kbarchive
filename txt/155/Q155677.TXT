TITLE   :XADM: Input Fields for Storage Limits Display Only Five Digits
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The range of numbers that you can enter in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator
program for public or private Information Store (IS) Storage Limits is from 0 to
2,097,151 kilobytes. However, the width of the input field is only five
characters. Therefore, when you enter a number that is more than 5 characters,
the number scrolls in the input field and displays only the most recent 5.

WORKAROUND
==========

By moving the cursor within the input field, you can view all of the digits that
you entered.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
