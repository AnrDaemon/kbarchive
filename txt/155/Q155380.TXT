TITLE   :XCLN: Unable to Load Top Level Information
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to run Setup.exe for the Microsoft Exchange client, the
following error message may appear:

   Unable to Load Top Level Information

CAUSE
=====

This can occur if the Win.ini file, or the Registry for the Windows NT or
Windows 95 clients, has a predefined entry for the Microsoft Exchange client
under the [MS Setup (ACME) Table Files] section. For example:

Win.ini

   [MS Setup (ACME) Table Files]
   exchng.exe@v4.0.993.4(1033)=C:\EXCHANGE\exchng.stf

Registry

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\MS Setup (ACME)\Table Files

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the workaround for your Microsoft Exchange client.

Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client:

 - Remove or remark (by placing a semicolon at the beginning of the line) the
   following entry from the Win.ini:

      [MS Setup (ACME) Table Files]
      exchng.exe@v4.0.993.4(1033)=C:\EXCHANGE\exchng.stf

You can now run Setup as usual.

Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client or Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows NT or Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee
that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

      Software\Microsoft\MS Setup (ACME)\Table Files

3. Delete this key.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

You can now run Setup as usual.
