SYMPTOMS
========

During the restoration of data from Ntbackup, double-clicking tapes may produce
the following error message:

   No uncataloged sets were found on tape.

If the tape is read successfully, the option to restore by individual file or
subdirectory may be unavailable.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may be caused by any of the following reasons:

 - The Tapes window may have changed so that a portion of the window is hidden.

 - The tape unit has old firmware.

 - A good catalog was never created.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do the following:

 - In the Backup window, click Split on the View menu. Move the mouse pointer to
   the middle right of the Tapes window and click the left mouse button once.
   This will make the hidden catalog visible again. You can use this catalog to
   restore an individual file or subdirectory.

 - Check the firmware of the tape unit and the tape controller speed.

 - Use the NTBACKUP /Missingtape command to force the creation of a new catalog.
