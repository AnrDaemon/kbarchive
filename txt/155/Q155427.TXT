 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

If you stop the Server service on a computer running Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51, and
then use Windows NT Diagnostics to view the network information, you will
receive the following error message:

   Error: NSG(s) 0 -ERR 2114.

When you click OK, the Network dialog box comes up blank.

If you stop the Server service on a computer running Windows NT 4.0, and then use
Windows NT Diagnostics to view the Network tab, you will receive the following
message:

   Windows NT Diagnostics

   Network Statistics are unavailable at this time (9 - 2114).

When you click OK, you will see the Network tab with the General, Transports, and
Settings buttons available, but the Statistics button will be unavailable.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, start the Server service. Full functionality of the
Windows NT Diagnostics program is not available without the Server service.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5, 3.51
and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here as
it becomes available.
