TITLE   :PRB: SET PRINTER TO Does Not Create File in VFP for Macintosh
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using triple question marks with the SET PRINTER TO <filename> command
does not create a file in Visual FoxPro 3.0b for Macintosh.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use one of the following methods to print to a file. The two examples below
create text files that contain both phrases on one line. The first uses the
double question marks and the SET PRINTER TO command. The following code example
demonstrates this concept:

      SET PRINTER TO  Test.txt
      SET PRINTER ON
      ?? 'Hello world'
      ?? 'This is a test'
      SET PRINTER TO
      SET PRINTER OFF

Also, the SET ALTERNATE command produces a text file. The following code creates
a file using the SET ALTERNATE command:

      SET ALTERNATE TO Test.txt
      SET ALTERNATE ON
      ?? 'Hello'
      ?? 'This is a test'
      SET ALTERNATE OFF
      SET ALTERNATE TO

According to the Visual FoxPro Help file, the SET ALTERNATE command functions
only with single and double question marks, and the DISPLAY and LIST commands.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In previous versions of FoxPro, the SET PRINTER TO <filename> and triple
question marks produces a text file. However, in Visual FoxPro 3.0b for
Macintosh, this technique does not produce a file, even though the code runs
without error.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Type the following code into the Command window or a program:

      SET PRINTER TO Test.txt
      ??? 'Hello World'
      ??? 'This is a test'
      SET PRINTER TO

The above code does not create a text file when executed under Visual FoxPro for
Macintosh. However, the code creates a file on the Windows, MS-DOS, and
Macintosh versions of FoxPro 2.x, and Visual FoxPro 3.0 and 5.0 for Windows.

Adding the SET PRINTER ON command to the code example creates a text file;
however, the file contains no information. The code example below demonstrates
this behavior:

      SET PRINTER TO Test.txt
      SET PRINTER ON
      ??? 'Hello World'
      ??? 'This is a test'
      SET PRINTER OFF
      SET PRINTER TO
