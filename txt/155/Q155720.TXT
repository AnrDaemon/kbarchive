TITLE   :Aldus Persuasion Table Uses Marlett as Default Font
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you insert an Aldus table into a newly created Aldus Persuasion document, the
default font used is Marlett, a non-text font. Changing the font with the table
formatting tools does not change the font from Marlett.

CAUSE
=====

Persuasion performs an EnumFontFamilies to determine which fonts are installed
and defaults to the first TrueType font returned. Marlett is the first TrueType
font returned. This is also the case for Microsoft Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the Text Properties command on the Edit menu to change the default font
permanently.
