-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Tabbing into an Option group does not select the highlighted Option. Rather, it
will always go to the first option when you use the TAB key or the last option
when you use the SHIFT+TAB KEY combination.

WORKAROUND
==========

The following steps show how to create an Option group that will always select
the highlighted Option when tabbing or shift-tabbing into the Option group:
(This will allow developers to create Visual FoxPro Forms with Option groups
that work the same as Option groups on Visual Basic or Access forms. If you are
not familiar with creating and using Visual Classes in Visual FoxPro, please see
Chapter 10 in the Microsoft Visual FoxPro Developer's Guide.)

1. Create a new class named Myoption based on Container.

2. Set the following properties for the Container: Width = 100 Height = 100
   BackStyle = 0 BorderWidth = 0

3. Add an Option Group to the Container and set the following properties:
   ButtonCount = 3 Height = 95 Width = 95 Left = 2 Top = 2

4. Add the following code to the GotFocus of the Container: * Check to see if
   the TAB or SHIFT+TAB key was used to enter the * container. IF LASTKEY() = 9
   OR LASTKEY() = 15 This.OptionGroup1.Buttons(This.OptionGroup1.Value).SetFocus
   ENDIF

5. Save and close the class.

6. Create a form and place two Text Boxes and the Myoption class on it.

7. Run the form, select the middle option in the Option Group, and then use the
   TAB key to leave and reenter the Option Group.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
