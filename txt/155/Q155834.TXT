======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the ODBC drivers that are included with Microsoft Visual
FoxPro for Windows and covers issues that might arise in the installation and
configuration of these drivers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows includes the following ODBC drivers:

 - Microsoft Access
 - Microsoft Excel
 - Microsoft SQL Server
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro
 - Microsoft FoxPro 2.6 and dBASE
 - Oracle
 - Paradox
 - Text files

These drivers are installed in your Windows System directory along with the
32-bit ODBC Administrator. Once installed they cannot be removed by an uninstall
of Visual FoxPro, allowing other applications that require them to function
properly.

In addition to installing the drivers and the ODBC Administrator, default data
sources are created for the types of files listed below. You may use these to
access data files on your machine without having to create a new data source:

 - dBASE Files (*.dbf)
 - Excel Files (*.xls)
 - FoxPro Files (*.dbf)
 - Microsoft Access 7.0 Databases (*.mdb)
 - Paradox Files (*.db)
 - Text Files (*.txt, *.csv)
 - Visual FoxPro Databases (*.dbc)
 - Visual FoxPro Tables (*.dbf)

Default data sources are not created for the Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle
drivers. You must use the 32-bit ODBC Administrator to create them. (See the
note about the Oracle ODBC Driver below).

Notes on the Microsoft Visual FoxPro driver
-------------------------------------------

If you chose not to install the Visual FoxPro driver when you initially installed
Microsoft Visual FoxPro (either by selecting a Laptop Installation or by
unchecking it from the Custom Install) and you later re- run the setup program
to add the Microsoft Visual FoxPro driver, only the default data source for
Visual FoxPro tables are created. You may use the 32-bit ODBC Administrator to
create a default data source for Visual FoxPro databases.

Notes on the Oracle ODBC driver
-------------------------------

If you do not already have access to the Oracle database using Oracle's tools,
you cannot create a data source using the Oracle driver. Contact your Oracle
representative to get the necessary files to enable this access.
