SUMMARY
=======

When you troubleshoot some issues where a Windows NT boot disk is needed, you
may need the ARC path for the Boot.ini file. However, it may not be obvious, or
the machine administrator may not remember the partition or root directory the
operating system was installed in. This information can be recovered from the
Emergency Repair Disk.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Setup.log file is located on the Emergency Repair Disk. It has the system,
hidden, and read-only attributes. If this file is opened in a text editor, the
first few lines will provide information about how to build the ARC path to the
operating system. The following is an excerpt from a typical Setup.log file.

   [Paths]
   TargetDirectory = "\WINNT"
   TargetDevice = "\Device\Harddisk0\partition2"
   SystemPartitionDirectory = "\"
   SystemPartition = "\Device\Harddisk0\partition1"

A typical ARC path might be:

   multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(2)\WINNT="My Server 4.0"

The rdisk parameter is defined as Harddisk<X> on the TargetDevice line,
where <X> is a variable that represents the drive ordinal. Note that the
rdisk parameter is not used when SCSI replaces multi in the ARC path.

The partition parameter is defined as partition<X> on the TargetDevice
line, where <X> is a variable that represents the partition ordinal. Note
also that SystemPartition refers to the partition where NTLDR is stored. Use
TargetDevice for the partition ordinal value.

The TargetDirectory line defines the system root directory, which is the part of
the ARC path immediately following the partition number.
