TITLE   :SMS: Remote Reboot Fails on Clients Running Windows NT 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Remote Reboot option under Help Desk does not work with clients running
Windows NT 4.0 when nobody is logged on to the system.

When you first try to use Remote Reboot, only the "Begin Logon...Press Ctrl + Alt
+ Delete to log on" screen might disappear on the client. If you try to use
Remote Reboot again, the client is shut down but not restarted. Remote Reboot
works under Windows NT 4.0 if at least one person is logged on to the client
computer.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use Remote Control to log the client on, before
using Remote Reboot. Then close the Remote Control session, and use Remote
Reboot.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
