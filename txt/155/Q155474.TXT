TITLE   :PPT7: Text Does Not Display With Generic/Text Only Printer
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Any text typed on a PowerPoint 7.0 slide may appear as small dots if
Generic/Text Only is set as the printer driver. You may even see nothing on
screen. However, you can click in the text area and receive a typical cursor.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs most often when Windows 95 and PowerPoint were installed
recently and you have not installed a printer driver appropriate for your
printer. The Generic/Text Only driver is the default.

RESOLUTION
==========

You must add a printer driver to display text.

For more information about how to install a printer in Windows 95, search for
"Setting up, printers" in the Windows 95 Help Index.
