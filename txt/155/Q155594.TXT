-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article shows you an import file format that produces a custom recipient
with the same characteristics as a custom recipient produced using the Microsoft
Exchange Administrator program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To produce a custom recipient with the Exchange Administrator program, complete
the SMTP address and First and Last name fields in the "New Custom Recipient"
dialog box. Using the E-mail Addresses dialog box in the given custom recipients
dialog box, add a "New E-mail address" type of Internet Address.

To produce a custom recipient with the same characteristics as one produced by
the procedure above, use the following import file format:

   Obj-Class, First Name, Last name, Display Name, Alias Name, Directory Name,
   E-mail Address, Secondary-Proxy-Addresses

   Remote,User,1,User1,User1,User1,SMTP:User1@org.com,
   SMTP:User1@org2.com%SMTP:User1@org3.com%SMTP:User2@org2.com

NOTE: The file must be produced using a tool, for example Excel, that does not
produce an end-of-line character or line feed.
