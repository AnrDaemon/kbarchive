CAUSE
=====

The MTA terminated due to a resource shortage. The MTA is attempting to add
local resources for remotely-hosted connectors such as the Internet Mail
Connector (IMC) or the MS Mail Connector (MSMI).

WORKAROUND
==========

Change the following registry entry to 0x20 to avoid this resource shortage:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
                     \MSExchangeMTA\Parameters\MT gateway clients

The default setting is 0x08 and is adequate under normal conditions. However,
when an installation has several gateways and connectors configured, additional
resources may be required.
