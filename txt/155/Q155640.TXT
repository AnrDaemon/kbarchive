TITLE   :Cannot Find NetWare Server Using Partial Matching
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to find a NetWare server by using the right mouse button to click My
Computer, clicking Find Computer on the menu that appears, and then using a
wildcard or incomplete name (partial matching), Windows NT does not find any
NetWare servers.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT Explorer cannot locate NetWare servers with the Find Computer command
without the full server name.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the command-line equivalent to list all available NetWare neighborhood
servers. To do so, type the following line at a command prompt:

   net view /n:nw

Once you have determined the correct server name, use the Find Computer command
with the full server name.
