The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you zoom in and out using the View Changer in Creative Writer, there is no
scale that indicates the relative setting of the magnification.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Creative Writer 2.0 behaves differently than Creative Writer 1.0, which had a
scale that indicated the current zoom setting. You will know you are at the most
extreme zoom setting when you click either Zoom In or Zoom Out, and the tool tip
pops up more quickly and the writing space is not redrawn.

Additional query words: kids mskids max writer CW CW2 magnify big bigger small smaller
