The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can move Microsoft Exchange log or data files by using the Optimizer or the
Administrator program. This article describes how to move database paths using
the Administrator program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When using the Administrator program to move the database paths, the new
database path must exist before attempting the move or you will get the
following message:

   The specified path is not valid or is incomplete or is not local or does not
   exist. Specify a valid path name (ie C:\Exchsrvr\Dsadata)

You cannot select the Root of the drive.

After creating the new path, select the new path with the Path dialog box.
Microsoft Exchange Server will stop the appropriate service(s), move the
selected files, and restart the services.

If you attempt to move logs to a drive or disk that does not have enough space,
the following error message appears:

   There is not enough disk space to move the <name of your selection.>

In addition, any subsequent moves after this move are not processed. The list is
processed from the top to bottom. The change will remain on the screen until you
click Cancel.
