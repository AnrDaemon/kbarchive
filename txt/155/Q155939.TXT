SUMMARY
=======

This article provides an explanation of Clireg32.exe and how it is used for
remote automation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Clireg32.exe component allows you to register an OLE server (.exe) remotely.
It differs from the Remote Automation Connection Manager (RacMan) in that the
server does not need to be located on the machine registering it. The Setup
Wizard handles the maintenance of registering remote servers for you.

NOTE: Remote servers and Clireg files are stored in the \Windows\Olesrv\
directory, which is similar to Visual Basic if it is installed via the Setup
Wizard.

The Clireg32.exe program takes a number of parameters. The only required one is
the name of the .vbr file (generated with the server during build):

   Clireg32 myexesvr.vbr

In order to fully register a remote server, you must provide the network name,
network protocol, and security access. Clireg32 prompts you with a dialog box if
these options are not passed. For a list of all the parameters, simply execute
Clireg32.exe by itself.
