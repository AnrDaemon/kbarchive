TITLE   :Errors When a FlowModel Object Is Linked
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

FlowModel lets you insert objects into a diagram. If one Flowmodel diagram is
linked to another FlowModel diagram, an access violation occurs when the program
is closed.

CAUSE
=====

FlowModel does not handle OLE callbacks properly when linked to itself. Objects
from other programs can be linked to FlowModel without problems. The same errors
occur on earlier versions of Windows NT.
