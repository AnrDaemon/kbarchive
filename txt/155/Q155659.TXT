SUMMARY
=======

The following article discusses ways to optimize Monster Truck Madness
Performance.

RUNNING MONSTER TRUCK MADNESS ON A 486DX-66

Although Monster Truck Madness will run on a 486DX-66 with 16 MB
or more of memory, it is not recommended because performance
(particularly the frame rate) may not be sufficient for a
satisfying gaming experience.

To improve frame rate on slower computers, there are several things
you can try (see below).

QUIT UNNECESSARY PROGRAMS

To increase the amount of available system resources, quit all unnecessary
programs that are running on your computer before you start Motocross Madness 2.

To quit all unnecessary programs, use the appropriate method for your version of Microsoft Windows.

Windows 95/98:

1. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE.

2. In the Close Program dialog box, click any program except Explorer or Systray (which are components of Microsoft Windows), and then click End Task.

   If you receive a message stating that the program is busy or not responding, click End Task again.

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to quit all unnecessary programs that are running on your computer.

Windows 2000:

1. Press CTRL+SHIFT+ESC.

2. On the Applications tab, click any program, and then click End Task.

   Repeat this step to quit all unnecessary programs that are running on your computer.

3. Close Windows Task Manager.

NOTE: Some programs start automatically every time you restart your computer. For information about how to disable these programs, see the printed or online
documentation for the program.

CHANGING GRAPHICS RESOLUTION

In Monster Truck Madness, on the Options menu, click Graphics,
and then make the following adjustments:

Select 320 x 200 Simulation Resolution.

Select Image Quality = Low.

Select Texture = Low.

Select Shadow = None.

Select Tire = None.

Select Scenery = Sparse.

Clear Textured Sky.

Clear Horizon.

Select Automatic Full Screen.

Clear Smoke Effects.

Select Dashboard.

Clear Steering Wheel.

Click OK.

CLEARING OPTIONS

On the Options menu, click Game, and then make the following
adjustments:

Clear Show Commentary.

Clear Hear Commentary.

Clear View Intro Movie.

Clear View Clip Scenes.

Clear Automatic Attract Mode.

Set the Number of Default Opponents to 1.

   NOTE: The fewer opponents you have, the faster the game runs.
   It is possible to race without any opponents (set the Number of
   Default Opponents to 1). This gives you the experience of racing
   a time trial.

Click OK.

TURNING OFF SOUND

On the Options menu, click Sound, and then make the following
adjustments:

Select Playback Format = Mono.

Click OK.

NOTE: Turning off sound completely increases speed, but because
sound is an integral part of playing the game, turn it off as
a last resort.

IF YOU ARE USING A 3-D HARDWARE ACCELERATOR

Some hardware accelerators slow down when you select the Smoothing
check box (On the Options menu, click Graphics). Monster Truck
Madness may run faster if you clear this check box. If you don't
detect a performance difference with the check box cleared, clear it
or select it to suit your needs.
