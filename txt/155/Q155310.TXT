TITLE   :Cannot Print Pages in Reverse Order with HP 1600C Driver
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Hewlett-Packard (HP) 1600C printer driver included with Windows
NT 4.0, there is no option for printing in reverse order. You must reorder
multiple-page output to put it in the intended order.

For example, if you print a 100-page report, the first page is printed and
deposited in the output tray face up, the second page is printed and deposited
in the same way, and so on. When printing is completed, page 100 is at the top
of the tray. To read the report as intended, you must reorder the pages.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT version
4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some Windows NT printer drivers print multiple-page documents in reverse order
automatically or provide a reverse-order printing option. In addition, some
Windows NT-based programs may provide a program-specific option for printing
multiple-page output in reverse order.

The HP 1600C printer driver included with Windows NT 4.0 does not include a
reverse-order option.
