PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbdta kbconversion

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you choose a custom Slide Setup for a PowerPoint 95 presentation and then
save it in PowerPoint 4.0 format, the Slide Setup settings does not match the
actual slide size if you reopen the presentation.

If you reopen the presentation in PowerPoint 95, the slide size appears not to
have changed. However, if you click Slide Setup on the File menu, it indicates
the slide size has returned to the default (10" wide by 7.5" tall). When you
close the Slide Setup dialog box, your slides change to that default size.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This effect does not occur if you open the presentation in PowerPoint 4.0.


STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
