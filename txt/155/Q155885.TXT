TITLE   :XCLN: Update Not Updating Files in Directories w/Long File Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Schedule+, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running Update.exe for Microsoft Exchange Server Service Pack 3 on a client
computer running Windows 95, some files are not updated. Update.exe runs without
an error, and states that Setup was completed successfully.

The following are the affected files:

   Msspc32.dll
   Scanpst.exe
   Newprof.exe
   Exchng32.exe
   Mlshext.dll

CAUSE
=====

The update program uses the 16-bit version of the API to locate and read the
directory names. This version of the API does not support long file names, and
the process cannot find the files to be updated (that is, C:\Program
Files\Microsoft Exchange\Exchng32.exe) so they are never copied over the older
versions.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange clients,
version 4.0, listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected
in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S. Service Pack 4. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
