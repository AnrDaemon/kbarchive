TITLE   :SMS: IPX Address Not Inventoried When You Use TCP/IP
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you do not use a NetWare server as the Systems Management Server logon
server, the IPX address of a Windows client computer (using both TCP/IP and IPX
protocols) is not inventoried.

The TCP/IP address is inventoried; however, if TCP/IP is detected, the IPX
retrieval step is skipped.

NOTE: This problem does not occur with Windows NT client computers and clients
that are inventoried by a NetWare server. In both these cases, IP and IPX
addresses are retrieved successfully.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining
the Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
