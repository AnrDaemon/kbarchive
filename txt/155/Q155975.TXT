PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to perform a file transfer using the Help Desk utilities, the
Remote Files window will not display files compressed with the Windows NT file
system (NTFS) on a remote volume. Local NTFS-compressed files are displayed
normally.

CAUSE
=====

The File Transfer Slave on the client computer is returning only file names
which are not compressed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, decompress the files that you want to transfer from
the client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
