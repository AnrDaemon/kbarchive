KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbAutomation kbvfp500

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The client/server features of Visual FoxPro 5.0 are compatible with any version
of Oracle's SQL*Net and any Oracle ODBC driver, although some functionality may
be limited by the capabilities of the driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual FoxPro 5.0 was tested with SQL*Net version 1.0 on Windows NT using the
Visigenics Oracle ODBC driver that ships with Visual FoxPro. The Visigenics
Oracle ODBC driver works on Windows NT only.

SQL*Net is Oracle's network communication software. The client/server features of
Visual FoxPro (including the Upsizing Wizard) work with any version of Oracle
SQL*Net.

Refer to Oracle's documentation for instruction on installing SQL*Net. To verify
that SQL*Net has installed correctly and is working from the client, use an
Oracle client tool, such as SQL*DBA, to connect to the Oracle server.
