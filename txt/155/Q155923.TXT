SYMPTOMS
========

When you double-click My Computer on a computer with a multiple-disk CD-ROM
changer, it may take a long time (up to several minutes) for the folder to fully
appear on the screen.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT Explorer reads each of the CD-ROMs in the multiple-disk CD-ROM
changer for volume information before fully displaying the folder.
