TITLE   :IIS May Stop Responding after Processing Several Client Queries
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.0c
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 1.0, 1.0c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Internet Information Server (IIS) may stop responding after processing several
Universal Resource Locator (URL) requests for an .htm file with additional
relational operators as in the following example:

   http://www.server.com/default.htm/...and so on...

CAUSE
=====

IIS enters an infinite loop trying to service URL requests for .htm files with
additional relational operators. This behavior would eventually result in
several server pool threads in infinite loops taking CPU cycles and causing IIS
to stop responding.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in IIS versions 1.0 and 1.0c. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the
