The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to print from a Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 3.x to an
HP Deskjet 600 series printer or a HP Deskjet 870cxi, a blank page is printed
with a page number at the bottom of the page.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are two workarounds for this problem. Either use the HP Deskjet 500 driver
(no color support) or add the following entry to the [Options] section of the
Exchng.ini file:

   UsePrintBanding=0

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the Microsoft Exchange client
for Windows 3.x running on Microsoft Windows for Workgroups and Microsoft
Windows 3.1. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
