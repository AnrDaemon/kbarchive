TITLE   :PERL Scripts Fail to Execute & Not Load the Advapi32.dll File
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a PERL script with Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), you
may get the following error:

   CGI Error:

   The specified CGI application misbehaved by not returning a complete set of
   HTTP headers. The headers it did return are:

   Cannot load advapi32.dll.

However, the PERL script will run without errors from the command line without
using IIS.

CAUSE
=====

The Advapi32.dll file is used by PERL and in turn, tries to open another DLL in
the Microsoft Windows NT System32 directory. If it fails to load the DLL in
\System32, Advapi32.dll will also fail to load causing the above error message.

WORKAROUND
==========

The credentials of the IUSR_servername (IIS anonymous account) are used to
access the Windows NT System directories. If this account does not have
sufficient privileges to a file or directory, PERL or other CGI scripts may fail
to execute.

Check the permissions on the Winnt\System32 directory and make sure the
IUSR_servername account has sufficient access.
