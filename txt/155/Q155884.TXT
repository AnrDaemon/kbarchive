TITLE   :SNA Server 2.x IP Communication Fails w/15 Char Domain Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.1,2.11,2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you configured multiple SNA Servers in the same Microsoft Windows NT domain
(in the case of version 2.11, the same SNA Server subdomain) but are separated
by TCP/IP routers, the backup and member SNA Servers will not be able to locate
the SNA Server primary configuration server if the Windows NT domain name is 15
characters long.

When you start SNA Server Admin on a backup SNA Server, you will get the
following popup error message:

   The Primary SNA Server for the domain is not active.
   OK to attempt to open to a Backup SNA Server in read only mode?

This problem will occur with SNA Server 2.11 or 2.11.sp1 on any version of
Windows NT (3.5, 3.51 or 4.0).

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

CAUSE

workaround for the problem, except to change the Windows NT domain name to a
name less than 15 characters.

STATUS
