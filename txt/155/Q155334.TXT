The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows 95 RPL (remote program load) boot client can only log on to a Windows
NT domain as the current user. Windows 95 prompts you twice for your user name
and password: once from a command prompt and again from a dialog box. You must
supply the same user name and password at the command prompt and at the dialog
box. If you attempt to change the user name and/or password you will receive the
following error message:

   The domain password you supplied is not correct, or access to your logon
   server has been denied.

NOTE: However, you can log on as a different user and password to a different
domain.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is no workaround to the problem. A user logging on from a Windows 95 RPL
client will need to log on as the same user name and password specified at the
command prompt and the dialog box.

STATUS
======

This is by design.
