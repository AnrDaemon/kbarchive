TITLE   :PRB: Stored Procedure PRINT Output May Be Truncated
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::4.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbProgramming kbprint kbEEdition kbPrinting kbVC

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the SQL Server ODBC driver, output from the PRINT statement to the Results
window inside the IDE stops after 64 lines.

CAUSE
=====

The output of the PRINT statement from the server is put in a queue by the ODBC
driver. The queue can hold up to 64 entries.

Because all of these PRINT statements occur within a single SQLExecute call, the
queue is being filled and the PRINT output is truncated.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Visual C++ Enterprise Edition,
version 4.2. This problem was corrected in Visual C++ Enterprise Edition,
version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, if you execute the following stored procedure with a value above
64, it will stop printing after the contents of @i equal to 64:

     create procedure JustLoop (@num integer) as

          declare @i integer
          declare @s varchar(255)

          select @s = convert(varchar, @num)

          select @i = 1
          while (@i <= @num)
          begin
              select @s = convert(varchar, @i)
              print @s
              select @i = @i + 1
          end

      return
