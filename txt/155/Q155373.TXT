TITLE   :Compaq Laptops Restart Instead of Powering Down
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Some Compaq computers do not power down after shutdown after you set the
registry value

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\winlogon\

   PowerdownAfterShutdown:REG_SZ:1

when you are using the Microsoft HAL. This value enables a Shut Down And Power
Off option on the Shut Down menu, but if you use this option, the computer
restarts instead of shutting down.

CAUSE
=====

This feature does not work correctly with the HAL included with Windows NT 4.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

To use this feature, you must obtain the HAL that supports this feature from the
computer's manufacturer.

It comes as part of the power management Softpaq, which you can download from
Compaq's Web site (http://www.compaq.com).
