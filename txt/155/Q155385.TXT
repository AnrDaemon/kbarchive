TITLE   :PRB: DEBUGOUT and ASSERT Commands Do Not Function in .exe
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The new debugging tools in Visual FoxPro version 5.0 and 6.0 do not function
when used in an .exe file. The .exe file ignores the DEBUGOUT command in 5.0,
5.0a, and 6.0. The ASSERT command generates a "Feature not available" error
inside of an .exe in Visual FoxPro 5.0, and is ignored in Visual FoxPro 5.0a and
6.0.

CAUSE
=====

Because the debugger is not distributed and does not function in a compiled
.exe, the functions that use the debugger also do not function within an .exe.

STATUS
======

This problem is by design and will not be changed.
