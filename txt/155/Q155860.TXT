PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Wine Guide for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you choose to Print Text or Copy Text from the Options menu in Wine Guide,
only some sections print or copy the title of a section and the copyright
information.

CAUSE
=====

Many of the printable sections in Wine Guide are graphic images and are not
printable as text. The Print Text and Copy Text options are available if the
area you are trying to print contains text. Wine Guide cannot tell if the text
portion of a page is limited to the title of a section or a picture copyright
information.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. When there is text available in a section, the Print
Text and Copy Text options will be available.

RESOLUTION
==========

On the Options menu, select the Print Window or Copy Window feature to print the
entire viewable area.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The areas of the program where the Print Text and Copy Text options are
available but do not provide useful or complete information are:

 - World Atlas of Wine.

 - Wine Tasting with Oz.

 - All About Wine.

In World Atlas of Wine, each wine-producing area only prints the name of the
region you are viewing and the copyright information for the map graphic when
you choose Print Text or Copy Text.

In Wine Tasting With Oz, when you choose Print Text or Copy Text, the four
sections available in the How To Taste Wine section print or copy only the
portions of the viewable area that are considered text.

When you choose the Print Text or Copy Text option in All About Wine, the
sections for In The Vineyard, In The Winery, Matching Food & Wine, Classic
Grape Varieties, and Reading The Label also print varying amounts of text.
