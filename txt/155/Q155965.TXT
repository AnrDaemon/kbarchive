The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you type text into a text box, you cannot use the CTRL+Z shortcut keys to
undo the action.

CAUSE
=====

The undo feature of Word is disabled when you type in a forms text box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Word 97 for Windows has an enhanced feature for creating online forms
that is both powerful and customizable: it provides options for entering data,
selecting choices, and recording feedback. The online form can be distributed
and collected via e-mail or over a network. When you create a custom program,
such as a form or a dialog box with ActiveX controls, by using the Control
Toolbox toolbar, you can take advantage of the Visual Basic programming language
in Word.

When you use the form control tools from the Control Toolbox, Word disables the
undo/redo feature. In addition, the shortcut keys for Undo and Redo (CTRL+Z and
ALT+BACKSPACE, or ALT+SHIFT+BACKSPACE, respectively) are disabled.

REFERENCES
==========

For more information on creating ActiveX forms in Word 97, see the "Create an
online form using ActiveX controls" topic in Word Help:

1. In Help, type in "ActiveX" (without the quotation marks), and click Search.

2. Under "What would you like to do?", click "Create a Form."

3. In the "Create a Form" topic, click "Create an online form using ActiveX
   controls."
