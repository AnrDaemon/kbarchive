TITLE   :WD97: Hyperlink Style Format Is Not Retained After Merge
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbualink97 kbfield

SYMPTOMS
========

When you merge a main document and a data document that contains a field
formatted with the Hyperlink style, the text that appears in the merged document
fails to appear in the Hyperlink style. This behavior does not affect the
functionality of the hyperlink field, which is retained after the merge.

NOTE: By default, the Hyperlink style uses a blue underlined font.

CAUSE
=====

By design, you can format a merge field in the main document; however, Word
overrides formatting applied to fields in the data document with formatting
applied to the fields in the main document.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, select the field in the main document, including
the braces or chevron characters (<< >>), and then apply the
Hyperlink style to the field. When you merge to a new document, the hyperlink
text will appear in the Hyperlink style.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Word 97 automatically creates hyperlink fields when you type a Uniform Resource
Locator (URL) that is followed by a space. Word formats these fields with the
Hyperlink style. For additional information about how to create hyperlinks in
Word 97, open the Word Help Topics Index, and view the "Hyperlink, Creating"
topic.
