TITLE   :Cannot Enter Virus Scan Time in Symantec Norton NT Tools
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are trying to set a time for a weekly virus scan in the Norton Control
Center, you are unable to enter the time in the correct format. The program
requires the time to be entered in the format "hh:mm AM/PM" (for example, "12:00
AM"), but you are unable to enter anything but numbers.

CAUSE
=====

This edit control is mistakenly marked with the ES_NUMBER style, which means
that only digits can be entered.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can schedule virus scans by copying a time from a program such as Notepad
and pasting it in the edit box. You can also set the scheduled time by clicking
Scheduler on the Tools menu in the Norton AntiVirus Scanner. Contact Symantec
for more information.
