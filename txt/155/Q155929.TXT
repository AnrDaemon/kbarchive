TITLE   :BUG: APRINTERS Function Behaves Differently in Windows 95
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting kbvfp kbvfp300 kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With the APRINTERS() function, you can place the names of printers currently
installed in the Windows Print Manager into a memory variable array. The
APRINTERS() function creates a two-dimensional array. The first column of the
array contains the names of the currently installed printers, and the second
column contains the ports to which the printers are connected. In Windows 95, if
the specific printer's share name contains a space, the PRINTERS() function
returns a separate array row with the same printer name in the first column and
two incomplete share names in the second column. An example is a printer named
MyPrinter on share \\MyPrinter Share. The APRINTERS() function produces the
following two rows:

   Myprinter     \\MyPrinter
   Myprinter     Share

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the GETPRINTER() function to print directly to the printer name instead of
the share name. If the share name is required, concatenate the share name
strings that have the same printer name in the first column of the array.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Set up a Local Printer in Windows 95 or Windows NT. For this example, the
   printer name is "HP LaserJet 4Si MX" and the share name is "\\Tim\Test
   Printer."

2. On a second Windows 95 computer, issue the following command in the Visual
   FoxPro Command window:

         =APRINTERS(Lprint)

   The preceding command creates an array Lprint with the following elements:

         Lprint(1,1) = "HP LaserJet 4Si MX" , Lprint(1,2) = "\\Tim\Test"
         Lprint(2,1) = "HP LaserJet 4Si MX" , Lprint(2,2) = "Printer"
