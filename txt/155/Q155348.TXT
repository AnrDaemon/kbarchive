TITLE   :Some Programs Do Not Notify When Setup Is Finished

KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install some programs, you receive no indication that the Setup process
is finished. If you switch another program to the foreground while the Setup
program is running, you may not realize Setup has finished.

CAUSE
=====

Many programs display a "Setup complete" message in a modal dialog box. A modal
dialog box sets the focus to the dialog box and requires user interaction.
However, some Setup programs do not display a message, or do not use a modal
dialog box.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can use the following methods to display tasks that are currently running:

 - Press ALT+TAB to display the running tasks until the Setup program is
   selected.

 - Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE and then click Task Manager to display the running
   tasks. Click the Setup program and then click Switch To.
