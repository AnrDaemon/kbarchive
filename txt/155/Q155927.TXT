SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install an Olicom Token Ring network adapter and an Intel
TokenExpress network adapter in the same computer, you may receive the following
error message:

   Registry subkey already exists!
   Installation failed

CAUSE
=====

The Olicom Token Ring adapters and the Intel TokenExpress adapters share some of
the same registry entries.

The Olicom Token Ring adapters and Intel TokenExpress adapters are basically the
same, and can use the same driver.
