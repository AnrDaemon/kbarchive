SYMPTOMS
========

When issuing a query from Internet Information Server version (IIS) 2.0 using
the Internet Database Connector (IDC) to an Access database using ODBC, the
Internet Server services (WWW, FTP and Gopher) stop.

Usually this is accompanied by a Dr. Watson error stating that Dr. Watson could
not attach to the application, or you may see the following error in your
browser:

   The server returned an invalid or unrecognized response.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Microsoft Jet 3.0. A fix for
the problem is available from the Microsoft resources listed below.

For additional information about this update, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q143163 : PRA: Problems Running Microsoft Jet 3.0 on Windows NT 4.0

If the Jet fix does not fix the problem, then you need to change the following
registry entry:

problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
