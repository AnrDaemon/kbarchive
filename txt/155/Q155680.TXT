PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbnetwork kbtshoot kbsmsAdmin smsadmin smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the Site Properties are updated to allow a user group (such as Help Desk)
or a user to do remote troubleshooting, Systems Management Server 1.2 will
update the registry on new Windows NT clients, but not on existing clients.

WORKAROUND
==========

Run Upgrade.bat from a Systems Management Server logon server to update the
remote control registry parameters on existing Windows NT clients. Doing this
will cause the Client Configuration Manager to reconfigure the Windows NT client
with the correct registry entries.

STATUS
======

This is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default in Systems Management Server 1.2, only the members of the local
Administrators group are allowed to take remote control of a computer running
Windows NT. From the Systems Management Server Administrator utility, it is
possible to give additional user groups or users the permission to do remote
control.

To do this, click the Clients button on the Site Properties window. The Options
button adjacent to the Remote Troubleshooting options will allow you to add or
remove group and user names.

After a change has been made to this list, the changes are written to the site
control file and the Systems Management Server database. However, the changes
will not be written to the following registry location:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Client Services\Remote
   Control\Parameters\PermittedViewers

Client Configuration Manager will update the registry during the setup of new
Windows NT clients, or during a Systems Management Server client software
upgrade. Once the registry has been updated, the users defined will be able to
take remote control of the computer running Windows NT.
