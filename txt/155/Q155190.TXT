TITLE   :PRB: Functions of the VC++ WPL May Not Respond as Expected
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When building a library of C functions to access with Visual FoxPro for
Macintosh (with the SET LIBRARY Command), you may choose to use the Microsoft
Visual C++ (VC++) compiler, which offers a set of functions (the Windows
Portability Library, or WPL) that may be ported to the Macintosh. These
functions may not work as expected or desired when loaded under Visual FoxPro
for Macintosh.

CAUSE
=====

Visual FoxPro for Macintosh was not designed to work with the functions of the
Windows Portability Library. Many of these functions allocate memory outside of
FoxPro, which is something that is not recommended within a library that will be
loaded from FoxPro.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use functions provided in the FoxPro API Library or the Mac Toolbox.

You may also be able to create a stand-alone application, using the functions of
the Windows Portability library, that may be run from Visual FoxPro via
AppleScript, using the FoxPro RUNSCRIPT command.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post more information in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
