======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply C2 security from the Windows NT Resource Kit, only user accounts
that are members of the administrator's group are allowed to log on. Others
receive one of the following messages:

   You are not allowed to logon from this workstation.

   -or-

   Your account is configured to prevent you from using this workstation.

CAUSE
=====

The C2 configuration application is configured with CrashOnAuditFail set to 2.
This value allows only administrators to log on to a server.

NOTE: An alternate error

   Access Denied: an extended error has occurred

may occur when attempting to connect to a file share on a server. This may also
indicate that CrashOnAuditFail is set to a value of 0x2.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and select the following subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa

2. Look for the value CrashOnAuditFail. If the value is set to 2, follow
   instructions outlined in Q140058 to change this value.
