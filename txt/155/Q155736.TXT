TITLE   :CD Player Seems to Hang with Multiple-CD Changer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using CD Player to play audio CDs on a multiple-CD changer, CD
Player seems to stop responding (hang). After 30 to 60 seconds, CD Player begins
responding again.

In addition, once CD Player has loaded and you are playing a CD, attempting to
access another CD in the changer from within Windows NT Explorer causes CD
Player to display the following message:

   Data or no disk loaded

CAUSE
=====

CD Player was not designed for use with multiple-CD changers. The amount of time
it takes CD Player to initialize for a multiple-CD changer is dependent upon the
size of the changer. Because of the information presented to CD Player when
another CD is accessed, CD Player cannot properly interpret what is being done
with the drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

To have CD Player properly display an audio CD when accessing other CDs, quit CD
Player and restart it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For each CD, CD Player views the CD in one of two states: Loaded or Ejected.
However, with multiple-CD changers, there is a third state: Unloaded. Unloaded
means the CD is in the drive, but not currently under the CD-ROM drive's read
head. CD Player interprets an unloaded CD as an ejected CD. However, because the
CD is not actually ejected, CD Player is never updated.
