When upgrading your installation of IIS from version 1.0 to version 2.0, your
customized system settings (such as a modification to the WWW password
authentication), will be maintained.

When executing the IIS 2.0 Reinstall feature to reinstall your current selection

The Reinstall feature is designed to restore a publication server to the default
settings to assist in troubleshooting.
