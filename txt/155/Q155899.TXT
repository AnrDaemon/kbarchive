TITLE   :WD97: Merged Document Based on Elegant Template Includes Header
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows

KEYWORDS:kbtemplate kbmerge

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a mail merge main document using the Elegant, Professional, or
Contemporary Templates, attach an envelope to the main document, and then merge
the document, the envelopes for the second and subsequent merged documents may
include headers and footers.

CAUSE
=====

During the mail merge process, Word uses the header and footer information from
the main document in the merged document. This information is in the original
template on which you based the document (Elegant, Professional or Contemporary
Template).

The Contemporary and Elegant Templates include a different first page header and
footer, and a header for the second and subsequent pages. The Professional
Template includes a different first page header, and a header for the second and
subsequent pages. During the mail merge process, Word retains the Same as
Previous property in the header and footer, and as a result, each new section
places headers and footers into the envelopes.

NOTE: This problem occurs with other Microsoft or third-party templates that have
a different header for the first page versus the remaining pages in the
document.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, open the mail merge main document and use either of
the following methods.

Method 1: Removing the Header and Footer
----------------------------------------

NOTE: If you use this method, you cannot place and headers or footers into your
document.

1. On the File menu, click Page Setup, and then click the Layout tab.

   NOTE: If you are unable to click Page Setup, click the first page of your
   document (not the envelope page).

2. Under Headers and Footers, click to clear the Different First Page check box,
   and then click OK.

3. On the View menu, click Header and Footer.

4. Click the Show Next button in the Header And Footer toolbar, until the header
   for section 2 is shown.

5. Select the text in the header, and then click Clear on the Edit menu.

6. Click the "Switch Between Header and Footer" button on the Header and Footer
   toolbar. If the footer for section 2 is not shown, click the Show Previous or
   Show Next button until the footer for section 2 is shown.

7. Select the text in the footer, and then click Clear on the Edit menu.

8. Click Close on the Header and Footer toolbar.

Method 2: Retaining the Header and Footer
-----------------------------------------

NOTE: This method only works with documents that are based on the Elegant or
Professional Templates. It does not work with documents based on the
Contemporary Template, because this template contains graphics.

1. Place the insertion point into the upper left part of the envelope within the
   mail merge main document. The Style should be Envelope Return.

2. On the File menu, click Page Setup, and then click the Layout tab.

3. Under Headers and Footers, click to select the Different First Page check
   box, and then click OK.
