IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article tells you how to allow the Microsoft Exchange Client to connect to
Microsoft Exchange Server over an existing connection to the Internet and
through a firewall. In order to do this, make the ports assigned to these
connections static. This requires you to add entries to the registry.

Internet firewalls, please click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

You must restart the computer for these changes to take effect.

To make the ports static:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

   System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeDS\Parameters

3. Add the following entry for the Microsoft Exchange Directory service:

   TCP/IP port REG_DWORD
   DATA: <port number to assign>

   NOTE: Microsoft recommends that you assign ports from the 5000 - 65535
   (decimal) range. For additional information about the guidelines for static
   port assignment of Exchange Server services, please see the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base article in the "More Information" section.

   EXAMPLE: "TCP/IP Port"=dword:00001388(5000)

   The decimal number 5000 was used for the DS, 1388 in hexadecimal format.

4. Locate the following subkey:

   System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersSystem

5. Add the following entry for the Information Store:

   TCP/IP port REG_DWORD
   DATA: <port number to assign>

   NOTE: Microsoft recommends that you assign ports from the 5000 - 65535
   (decimal) range. For additional information about the guidelines for static
   port assignment of Exchange Server services, please see the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base article in the More Information section.

   EXAMPLE: "TCP/IP Port"=dword:00001389(5001)

   The decimal number 5001 was used for the IS, 1389 in hexadecimal format.

6. Quit Registry Editor.

After this, you must configure the packet filter (or firewall) to allow
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections to be made to these ports as
well as to port 135.

Further Explanation
-------------------

A packet filter (or firewall) denies connection attempts made to any port for
which you have not explicitly allowed connections. Microsoft Exchange Server
does use a well-known static port (port 135) to listen for client connects to
the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Endpoint Mapper Service. However, after the
client connects to this socket, Microsoft Exchange Server then re-assigns the
client two random ports to use when communicating with the directory and the
information store. This makes it impossible to allow these through the firewall
without forcing them to be statically assigned.
