======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Each Visual FoxPro object has an Application property that you can use to
reference the Application object for the current instance of Visual FoxPro.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This new property works for both the development version of Visual FoxPro and a
Visual FoxPro executable. The Application property provides access to the
properties and methods associated with the _VFP object. For example, assume you
want to display the DefaultFilePath property for the current instance of Visual
FoxPro from the Click event of a command button in a form. The following code
placed in the Click event of a command button provides this information:

      WAIT WINDOW This.Application.DefaultFilePath

In a Visual FoxPro 5.0 executable, the application property is also useful. The
following code in the Click of a command button can change the title of the
executable:

      _VFP.Caption="This is a Different Title"

The Application property and _VFP are used interchangeably. Therefore, all of the
following return the same value--"Microsoft Visual FoxPro":

      ?_VFP.NAME
      ?_VFP.APPLICATION.NAME
      ?APPLICATION.NAME
      ?_VFP.PARENT.NAME
      ?_VFP.APPLICATION.PARENT.NAME
      ?APPLICATION.PARENT.NAME
