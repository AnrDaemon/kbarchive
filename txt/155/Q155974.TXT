TITLE   :Hardware Profiles Have an Empty Description Line
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to edit your hardware profiles, there is an empty line in your list
of available profiles.

To see the list of available profiles:

1. Right-click the My Computer icon and click Properties.

2. On the Hardware Profiles tab, there is a list of available profiles.

CAUSE
=====

There may be a problem in the PreferenceOrder setting of the registry. Look in
the Registry in the subtree HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE at the following subkey:

   \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control IDConfigDB\ 
   Hardware Profiles\<available profiles>\PreferenceOrder

The PreferenceOrder of all available Profiles should be listed in a sequence. If
there is a missing line in your list of available Profiles, one PreferenceOrder
may be out of sequence.

WORKAROUND
==========

Change the PreferenceOrder setting so that all PreferenceOrder settings are in
sequence.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and locate the following Registry subkey
   in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree:

   \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\IDConfigDB\Hardware Profiles\<list of
   available profiles 000x>

2. Select the profile to edit.

3. Highlight PreferenceOrder (REG_DWORD).

4. On the Edit menu, click Edit - DWORD.

5. Change the data so that all profiles are in sequence.

6. Click OK and quit the Registry Editor.

7. Shut down and restart Windows NT.
