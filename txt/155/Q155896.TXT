TITLE   :XFOR: MTA Causes Application Exception Error in Oxpufret
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server MTA causes an application exception error during
the operation of the RAS connector when the RAS connector is being shared by
other processes on the computer running Windows NT Server.

If symbols are loaded, the Dr. Watson log normally indicates that an exception
error occurred in the EMSMTA!oxpufret function, often at memory location
02199613.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange Server MTA may cause the exception error when a failure
is returned when it requests dialup or protocol information. The MTA may attempt
to access the information once the information has been nulled out, causing the
exception error.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 4.0 and 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft
Exchange 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack,
