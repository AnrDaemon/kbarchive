The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When the 32-bit version of Visual SourceSafe 4.0 is launched, an error message
is displayed.

In Windows NT 3.51, the dialog box says, "The procedure entry point
?VS_FileGetHdr@@YAHPADPAUFILEHDR@@@Z could not be located in the dynamic link
library ssapi.dll." When the OK button is clicked, another dialog box appears
that says, "The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0000139). Click on
OK to terminate the application." When the OK button is clicked, the user is
returned to the operating system.

In Windows 95, the dialog box says, "The SSGUI.DLL file is linked to missing
export SSAPI.DLL:?VS_FileGetHdr@@YAHPADPAUFILEHDR@@@Z." When the OK button is
clicked, another dialog box appears that displays the path to the SSEXP.EXE file
and says, "A device attached to the system is not functioning." When the OK
button is clicked, the user is returned to the operating system.

However, if the 16-bit version is launched, it starts without a problem. There is
a newer version of Ssapi.dll and Ssus.dll in the WIN32 subdirectory which is not
compatible with Win32\Ssexp.exe.


Download Vssdll4.exe, a self-extracting executable, to the VSS\WIN32 sub-
directory. Run the file and overwrite the existing DLLs. Remember to update both
the local and server installations of Visual SourceSafe with the correct version
of the DLLs.

The following files are available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

Vssdll4.exe

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.


One workaround to downloading the file is as follows:

If you don't have access to the Internet, you can sometimes get the two needed
files off the CD-ROM. The SSAFE1.CAB file on the CD-ROM must have a time/date
stamp of 1/16/96 or this won't work. The two files needed are: SSAPI.DLL and
SSUS.DLL. In order to get the files off the CD-ROM, you will need to run the
following command twice, once for each file.

   SYNTAX

   extract /L <subdirectory to extract the file to> ssafe1.cab <file to
   extract>

   Example:

   extract /L F:\VSS\WIN32 ssafe1.cab ssapi.dll

   and then run:

   extract /L F:\VSS\WIN32 ssafe1.cab ssus.dll

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are newer versions of SSAPI.DLL and SSUS.DLL that are needed to work with
newer versions of DDConv.EXE and Analyze.EXE. The newer versions of DDConv.EXE
and Analyze.EXE are available to users for free from Microsoft download sites.
These new utilities should be put in their own sub- directory and not in the
WIN32 sub-directory.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Download DDConv4.EXE as mentioned in Microsoft Knowledge Base article
   Q150647.

2. Copy DDConv4.EXE into the WIN32 directory.

3. Run DDConv4.EXE to self-extract the files. Answer YES when prompted to
   overwrite files.

4. Run WIN32\SSEXP.EXE.
