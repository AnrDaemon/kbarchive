SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT 4.0 does not support the Hewlett-Packard (HP) ScanJet when it is
connected to an HP ScanJet interface card.

Windows NT 4.0 does support the HP ScanJet when it is connected to a supported
SCSI controller.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two versions of the HP ScanJet interface cards (SCSI Controller):

 - The older version of the controller is referred to as the "NCR SDMS 53C400A"
   and it supports the use of only IRQ 5. Which is not reconfigurable. All other
   installed hardware must be using an IRQ other than 5 or the scanner will not
   function.

 - The newer version of the controller is referred to as the "Symbios Logic
   400a" and it supports a wider variety of IRQ's. It is not limited to the use
   of IRQ 5, but the IRQ it does use must not conflict with any other hardware
   device installed in the system or else it will not function appropriately.
