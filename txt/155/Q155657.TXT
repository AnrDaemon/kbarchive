TITLE   :Incoming Internet Mail Not Formatted Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Windows Messaging to view Internet mail, if the mail is
formatted in columns using spaces to align the text, the columns do not align.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Windows Messaging does not use a fixed-pitch (or
monospace) font to display messages. The default font in Windows Messaging is a
variable-pitch font. There is currently no way to change the default font to a
fixed-pitch font.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
