======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Wine Guide for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you type information into a Note in Wine Guide, you cannot use the ENTER
key to create a carriage return and go to the next line. If you use the ENTER
key while you are typing in a Note, your note is created. This forces you to
enter one continuous line of text; you do not have the ability to move to
another line.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the SPACEBAR to enter enough spaces into the Note to move your cursor to the
next line. For example, type the first line of text and then press the SPACEBAR
entering enough spaces to move your cursor to the beginning of the next line and
begin typing again.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Wine Guide for
Windows, version 2.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
