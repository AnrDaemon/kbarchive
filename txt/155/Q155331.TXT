SUMMARY
=======

CAPSCRN.EXE and its associated driver SCRNCAP.DRV are installed during Video for
Windows (VfW) video tools (WINVIDEO) setup. To run this application under
Windows 95, the following line should be added under [drivers] section of
SYSTEM.INI file:

   MSVIDEO#=<full path name to>SCRNCAP.DRV

where # may be any number between 1 and 8 that does not conflict with existing
MSVIDEO entries.

If SCRNCAP.DRV is copied into <Windows 95 directory>\system folder, you may
omit the full path. For instance,

   MSVIDEO1=SCRNCAP.DRV

MORE INFORMATION
================

CAPSCRN.EXE is a tool that conveniently allows recording of screen activities
into an AVI file. When executing CAPSCRN.EXE, it is minimized on start up. Under
Windows 95, click the right mouse button to bring up the application menu. This
is different in Windows 3.x platform where the left mouse button is used.

The Win32 SDK includes a Windows 95 update to the Screen Capture program
(CAPSCRN.EXE) from Video for Windows. The updated version of CAPSCRN.EXE (and
SCRNCAP.DRV, which it also requires) can be found on the MSDN Win32SDK CD in
\mstools\bin\win95.
