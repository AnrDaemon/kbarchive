PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server Setup program will hang when it attempts to start
the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant (SA) if NetWare Clients version 3.5b or
4.0 for Windows NT are installed. The SA will also hang when restarting the
system if NetWare Clients version 3.5b or 4.0 for Windows NT are installed on an
existing Microsoft Exchange Server.

CAUSE
=====

NetWare Clients version 3.5b and 4.0 for Windows NT do not handle the MPR logon
notification for the SA service properly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is not possible to stop the service. Double clicking the SA service or
attempting to change the startup parameters in the Control Panel, Services
applet will return the following message:

   The service database is locked.

RESOLUTION
==========

The current Beta version of the NetWare Client for Windows NT does not cause
this problem. Contact Novell for more information.

The NetWare Client for Windows NT is manufactured by Novell, a vendor independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
