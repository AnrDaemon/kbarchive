TITLE   :PRB: "Error Retrieving Record" with SQL Statement in Open()
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:4.00 4.10 4.20
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbMFC kbODBC kbVC kbprb

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 4.0, 4.1 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following exception is thrown in a MFC database application that specifies a
SQL statement in the call to CRecordset::Open():

   Error retrieving record

The message appears in a message box as well as in the Output window of the
Visual C++ debugger.

The following debug messages are also displayed in the debug window if database
tracing is on:

   Warning: <type name> converted from SQL type <type number>.

   Error: fetching row from server.

   Error in row

   Error in assignment on column number <#> (<column name>)

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Access ODBC driver returns these errors if a column is bound to an
unsupported data type. The error message returned is specific to the 32-bit
Microsoft Access ODBC driver that ships with Visual C++ 4.x.

MORE INFORMATION
================

One reason for this error is that a developer has specified a SQL statement as
the second argument for the CRecordset::Open() function. In this case, the
columns listed in the SQL SELECT statement must match the order by which the RFX
functions are called in the CRecordset's DoFieldExchange(). The first RFX
function maps to the first column returned in the recordset, the second RFX
function maps to the second column, and so on. The exception is thrown when the
RFX functions are out of order. Paying attention to the exception can save
developers a lot of debugging time.

A different error message can be returned for other drivers, and is documented in
the following KB article.
