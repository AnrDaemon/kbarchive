SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing Windows NT 4.0, your Cogent eMaster 110 Fast Ethernet
PCI adapter is detected as a DEC 21140 network card.

2. On the Adapters tab, click the DEC 21140 network card, and then click Remove.

3. Click OK, and then click Add.

4. Click Have Disk.

5. Enter the following path:

   <drive>:\drvlib\netcard\x86\empci

   -OR-

   <drive>:\i386\drvlib.nic\empci

   where <drive> is the drive letter for your CD-ROM drive.

6. Click OK.

7. Select the proper settings for the card, and restart your computer when you
   are prompted to do so.
