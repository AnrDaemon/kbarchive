TITLE   :Cannot Install Modem After Removing and Reinstalling RAS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you remove and reinstall the remote access service (RAS) in Windows NT
4.0, the Install New Modem Wizard may be unable to detect your modem.

CAUSE
=====

Removing and reinstalling RAS in Windows NT 4.0 causes the Modem.inf file to be
overwritten. Any changes or modifications made to the previous Modem.inf file
are lost.

NOTE: The Modem.inf file is not overwritten during the normal Setup process.
During Setup, the current versions of the Modem.inf, Switch.inf, and Pad.inf
files are not altered, and new versions of these files are saved as Modem.new,
Switch.new, and Pad.new.

RESOLUTION
==========

If your modem is not on the Windows NT 4.0 Hardware Compatibility List (HCL),
use one of the following procedures to install your modem:

 - Obtain an .inf file that is designed for Windows NT 4.0 from the modem
   manufacturer. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for installing the modem
   in Windows NT 4.0. Contact the modem manufacturer for assistance with this
   procedure.

 - Install your modem as a standard modem using the following steps:

   1. In Control Panel, double-click Modems.

   2. The Install New Modem Wizard starts automatically if you have not
      installed a modem before. If the wizard does not start automatically, you
      have installed a modem previously and you should click Add to start the
      wizard.

   3. Click "Don't detect my modem; I will select it from a list," and then
      click Next.

   4. In the Manufacturers box, click Standard Modem Types. In the Models box,
      click a model that corresponds to the speed of your modem, and then follow
      the instructions in the Install New Modem Wizard.
