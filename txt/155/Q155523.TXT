TITLE   :Netlogon Stops Reponding or Records Event ID 5703
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Users cannot log on to the domain, and the event viewer generates the following
error:

   Event id: 5703 Source: Netlogon
   The data area passed to a system call is too small. Nt error 122.


CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the Netlogon service receives a mailslot that is greater
than the MAILSLOT_MESSAGE_SIZE (0x40c). This causes Netlogon to go into an
infinite loop, filling the event log. At this point, Netlogon cannot respond to
logon requests.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51.

A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression- tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
