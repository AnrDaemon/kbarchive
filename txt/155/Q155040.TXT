SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Wins Administrator or Winscl.exe to backup a WINS database, you may
get an error message indicating that the database cannot be backed up. Wins will
also post Event ID 4288 in the System Log.

   Event ID: 4288
   Source: WINS
   Type: Error
   Description: WINS Encountered an error during backup of the database to the
   directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

There may be multiple causes for this problem. Use the following steps to assist
in determining the root cause. For example, the Wins event message may have the
following hex data:

   00002589 FFFFFDFC

Perform the following steps to extract and analyze the WINS error code:

1. Check the hex data's second double-word (DWORD), that always indicates the
   error code. In this example, the error code is FDFC. Your error code may be
   different.

2. Take the 2s complement of the error code, that is 516, and then check out the
   error status in the Jet header file. In this example, error 516 maps to
   JET_errLoggingDisabled. This indicates that the Wins backup failed because
   logging is disabled.

2s Complement
-------------

The 2s Complement is a method for storing negative numbers such as these error
conditions in WINS. To determine the 2s complement of the number in the example,
follow these steps:

1. Start Calculator (Calc.exe).

2. On the View menu, click Scientific, and then click Hex.

3. Type FDFC, click Xor, and then click FFFF.

4. Click =, click +, and then click 1.

5. Click =, and then click Dec to convert the result to decimal.
