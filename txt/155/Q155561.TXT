TITLE   :WebSurfer Replaces Url.dll File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install WebSurfer, you receive the following error message:

   The procedure entry point ReinitializeCriticalSection could not be located in
   the dynamic link library KERNEL32.dll.


CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT 4.0 or Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 version of the Url.dll
file has been replaced with a Windows 95 version.

When you install WebSurfer, a dialog box appears warning you that the version of
the Url.dll file that WebSurfer is attempting to replace is a newer version. If
you choose to ignore that warning, the Windows NT 4.0 Url.dll file is replaced
with a Windows 95 version.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you are not using Internet Explorer 3.0, replace the Url.dll file with the
version on the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM.

If you are using Internet Explorer 3.0, reinstall Internet Explorer to replace
the Url.dll file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WebSurfer has been tested and appears to work as expected with both the Windows
NT 4.0 and the Internet Explorer 3.0 versions of the Url.dll file. WebSurfer
users should make sure they are using the most current version of WebSurfer by
contacting NetManage.
