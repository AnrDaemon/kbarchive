TITLE   :NFS Share Cannot Be Established from Windows NT Explorer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You are unable to create a shared volume with PC-NFS using Windows NT Explorer.

CAUSE
=====

PC-NFS was designed to work with Windows NT 3.5x and is unaware of Windows NT
Explorer.

RESOLUTION
==========

You must use File Manager with this product to create the shared volume.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The dialog box that provides for creating NFS shares in File Manager is not
provided by Windows NT 4.0, but rather by PC-NFS. It does not appear in Windows
NT Explorer because PC-NFS is unaware of Windows NT Explorer and is not designed
to work with it.

This information applies to users of Intergraph's (and SUN's) PC-NFS, but may
also apply to other NFS redirectors.

Intergraph and other vendors may make available versions of their products that
work with Windows NT Explorer. Please contact your vendor for more information.

The third-party products discussed here are manufactured by vendors independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
