TITLE   :XADM: Original Domain Controller Needed for New User Attribubtes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:; winnt:5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Active Directory Connector (ADC) for Microsoft Exchange
Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 (SP3) on a Microsoft Windows 2000-based computer, you
may experience the following behavior:

In the Active Directory Users and Computers snap-in, two new tabs appear in User
Account Properties. These tabs, the Exchange General and E-mail Addresses tabs,
are visible only on the domain controller on which the ADC was installed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the other domain controllers do not have the
Microsoft Active Directory Connector Management components installed. Therefore,
they are unable to view the two new user attributes.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, it is necessary to install the Microsoft Active Directory
Connector Management components on every domain controller on which you want to
be able to view the attributes.

To install the Active Directory Connector Management components, follow these
steps:

1. Double-click Setup.exe in the ADC folder.

   NOTE: On the Microsoft Windows 2000 Server compact disc, Setup.exe is found in
   \Valueadd\Msft\Mgmt\Adc.

2. After ADC Setup initializes, click Component Selection, and then select only
   the Microsoft Active Directory Connector Management components box.

   You do not need to install the Microsoft Active Directory Connector Service
   component.

3. Click Next, and then click Finish to complete the ADC setup.

Exchange Server does not need to be installed on the domain controllers to view
these new user attributes.
