======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Systems Management Server Administrator Console, it is
possible to assign a non-existent NetWare Directory Services (NDS) server to a
Site System Role (that is a Client Access Point). If this occurs, the System
Status Summarizer inaccurately reports that a non-existent server is failing
with an error 4711, 0 bytes disk space available. This can be misleading,
causing you to believe the system does exist and that it does not have any
available disk space. This has been reported to affect only NDS system entries.

WORKAROUND
==========

Avoid incorrectly defining nonexistent Netware NDS servers for Site System
Roles. To resolve the situation, remove the errant server from the Site System
Roles.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
