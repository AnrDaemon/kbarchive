-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Migration Wizard to move mailboxes into Exchange Server, the
wizard is able to create new accounts in Microsoft Windows 2000 Server for the
migrated mailboxes. You have the choice to either create random passwords for
these accounts or use the user's alias as the password.

In both cases, the wizard only accepts passwords up to 14 characters long. Any
additional characters are truncated.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Migration Wizard was created for earlier versions of the operating system
(Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 and earlier), which had hard limits of
14-character passwords. Windows 2000 Server accepts passwords of up to 127
characters.

This behavior is by design.

Additional query words: mailmig; win2000
