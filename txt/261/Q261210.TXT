======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a scheduled directory synchronization (dirsync) occurs from Exchange Server
to Lotus Notes, or if you click "Immediate full reload" on the Dirsync Schedule
tab of the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes properties to force
dirsync from Exchange Server to Notes, some of the Exchange Server recipients
may not be replicated to the Notes database.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the users that are not replicated to the Notes
database do not have Notes addresses.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, enable the Notes address generator and apply Notes
addresses to the Exchange Server recipients:

1. In the Configuration container, open the Site Addressing properties.

2. Click the Site Addressing tab.

3. Click to select the Notes check box, and then click OK to enable the change.

4. When a dialog box is displayed that requests confirmation that you want to
   update all recipients, click Yes.

If you do not want certain Exchange Server recipients to be replicated to Notes,
delete those users' Notes e-mail address from the E-mail Addresses tab of the
users' mailbox properties.
