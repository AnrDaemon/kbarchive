SUMMARY
=======

As with the other Microsoft Office products, Microsoft Visio 2000 can be
controlled through Automation from Visual FoxPro. This article demonstrates some
basic functionality.

MORE INFORMATION
================

   loVisio = CREATEOBJECT("Visio.Application")
   loDoc = loVisio.Documents.Add("")  && No default template
   loPage = loVisio.ActivePage

   *!* The origin of a Visio drawing is the lower-left corner, not 
   *!* the top left. However, the coordinates for DrawRectangle go
   *!* from top left to bottom right.
   loShape = loPage.DrawRectangle(1, 5, 5, 1)

   loShape.Copy()    && Copy shape to the Clipboard
   loPage.Paste()    && Paste copy into drawing page
   loShape.Cut()     && Remove original

   *!* Since the copied shape was the last one drawn, it can be retrieved 
   *!* from the end of the shape collection.
   loShape = loPage.Shapes.Item(loPage.Shapes.Count)

   *!* Move to the bottom left corner of the page by setting its 
   *!* PinX and PinY formulas. PinX and PinY are the coordinates
   *!* that "pin" the shape to the page, so moving them moves
   *!* the shape. The pin for a rectangle is in the center, so
   *!* setting the coordinates as below puts the shape right on
   *!* the edges.
   loShape.Cells("PinX").Formula = "Width * 0.5"
   loShape.Cells("PinY").Formula = "Height * 0.5" 
   loShape.Text = "Switch back to VFP to close."

   =MESSAGEBOX("Hit OK when you are ready to close the document.")

   IF TYPE("loDoc") = "O" and ISNULL(loDoc)
      RETURN
   ELSE
      loDoc.Saved = .T. && Make Visio think the doc has already been saved
      loVisio.Quit      && so you can quit without a Save dialog.
   ENDIF
