PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbhw kbmsn

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

When you play Microsoft Allegiance, you may experience both of the following
symptoms:

 - When you attempt to yaw to the left, the throttle increases.

 - When you attempt to yaw to the right, the throttle decreases.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you are using a Logitech Cyberman 2 3-D game
controller.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, use a pointing device to maneuver in Allegiance.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The CyberMan 2 is a 6-axis gamepad with a built-in joystick. The joystick
controls the following movements:

 - Move the joystick forward or backward to control the pitch.

 - Move the joystick to the left or right to control the yaw.

 - Rotate the joystick to control the roll.

 - Angle the joystick to the left or right to control the throttle. (This motion
   is very similar to the yaw control).
