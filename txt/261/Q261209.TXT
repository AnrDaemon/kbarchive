KEYWORDS:kbhw kbimu msgame kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft StarLancer, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You cannot assign a different function to the POV (hat) switch on your joystick
in Microsoft StarLancer.

Your only available option is to enable or disable the default function that is
assigned by StarLancer to the POV switch on the joystick.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can customize the keyboard or joystick assignments of 73 different functions
in StarLancer. However, you are unable to assign a different function to the
joystick POV switch. You can only use the POV switch to look to the right, look
to the left, and look behind you.

This behavior is by design.
