SUMMARY
=======

The default Control newsgroups that are installed with the Microsoft Network
News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) service that is included with Internet Information
Server (IIS) version 4.0 are visible by default. This article provides steps to
hide those newsgroups.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To hide the default NNTP newsgroups from users:

1. Set the permissions on the appropriate folder:

   a. Select the Control folder, which is located by default in the following
      folder:

   %SystemRoot%\Inetpub\Nntpfile\Root

   b. Right-click the Control folder, and then click Properties. Click the
      Security tab, and then click Permissions.

   c. In the Directory Permissions dialog box, click the Everyone group in the
      Name list. Under Type of Access, click No Access.

NOTE: If you allow anonymous access to the NNTP server, you must also set the
permissions to No Access for IUSR_<server_name> (where <server_name>
is the name of the IIS server that is running the Microsoft NNTP service) to
hide these newsgroups from anonymous users.

2. Enable the "Restrict newsgroup visibility" option:

NOTE: If you enable the "Restrict newsgroup visibility" option, you add
processing overhead according to the NNTP services Help.

   a. On the Start menu, click Programs, and then click Windows NT 4.0 Option
      Pack.

   b. Click Microsoft Internet Information Server, and then click Internet
      Service Manager.

   c. Start Microsoft Management Console (MMC), right-click the Default NNTP
      Site object, and then click Properties.

   d. In the Default NNTP Site properties, click the Home Directory tab. Under
      Access restrictions, click "Restrict newsgroup visibility". Click Apply,
      and then click OK to save the changes.
