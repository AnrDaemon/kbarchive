The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Site Server version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Microsoft Windows NT Option Pack (NTOP) Setup program to
install Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0, you can specify a
location for the Wwwroot directory. However, in Microsoft Internet Information
Services (IIS) version 5.0, this option is no longer available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To move the default Web site to a different location, perform the following
steps:

1. Stop the default Web site.

2. Move the Inetpub/Wwwroot directory to a different location.

3. On the Home Directory tab, modify the default Web site settings to point to
   the new location.

4. Start the default Web site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you plan to install Microsoft Site Server and you want to move the Wwwroot
directory to a different location, Microsoft recommends that you make this
change before you install Site Server.
