KEYWORDS:kbenv kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In a mixed Systems Management Server (SMS) hierarchy where SMS 1.2 primary and
secondary sites report up to an SMS 2.0 central site, the Distribute Software
Wizard may not reliably display or distribute packages to all the SMS 1.2
default package servers configured in the SMS 1.2 sites.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do not use the Distribute Software Wizard to
distribute packages in a mixed SMS 1.2 and SMS 2.0 environment.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is not a problem when you manually distribute packages using the
SMS Administrator console (right-click the distribution points of the package,
and then click Update Distribution Points or Manage Distribution Points).
