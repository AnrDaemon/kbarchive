KEYWORDS:kbClient kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbAdvertisement kbPackage kbSoftwareDist kbsms200preSP2fi

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you distribute a program that reboots the client computer, Available
Programs Manager (APM) may enter an endless loop. This causes the program to
continuously run at startup, followed by a restart. This behavior occurs only
when the rebooting package is part of a dependency chain, and the target
computer is running Microsoft Windows NT 3.51.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if APM quits before the rebooting program quits, causing APM
to lose the status of the program. This causes APM to run the program again
after the reboot. The client then becomes stuck in a loop; every time it boots,
it runs the offer and reboots again.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

WORKAROUND
==========

You may be able to work around this behavior by un-advertising the rebooting
package to the Windows NT 3.51-based clients.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2. This problem was first corrected in Systems
Management Server version 2.0 Service Pack 2.
