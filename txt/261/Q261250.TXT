components in the Active Server Pages (ASP) code. This method provides an
alternative for .inc files with CONSTANTS.

================

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Open a new ActiveX DLL Visual Basic project.

2. Rename Project1 to PrjEnum, and rename Class1 to ClsEnum.

3. Copy the following code to ClsEnum:

   Public Enum Salsa
       Mild
       Medium
       Hot
   End Enum

   Public Function test(var As Salsa) As String
       Select Case var
           Case Mild
               test = "Can I get a Mild Salsa"
           Case Medium
               test = "Can I get a Medium Salsa"
           Case Hot
               test = "Can I get a Hot Salsa"
           Case Else
               test = "No thanks!"
       End Select
   End Function

4. Compile and make the PrjEnum.dll.

5. Create a blank ASP page, copy the following code, and then save the .asp
   page:

   Note Make sure that the file path, which is referenced in the METADATA tag, is
   correct.

   <!-- METADATA TYPE="typelib" FILE="c:\MyProjects\PrjEnum\PrjEnum.dll" -->
   <%
   	Dim Obj
   	Set Obj = Server.CreateObject("prjEnum.clsEnum")
   	response.write "What kind of salsa would you like?<BR>"
   	response.write Obj.test(Hot)
   	set obj = NOTHING
   %>

6. In your browser, browse to the new .asp page to check the results.
