TITLE   :SMS: Tlist Causes Backup to Hang
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,2.0 SP1,2.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Systems Management Server (SMS) Backup service (SMS_BACKUP) runs, the
backup may not finish and Tlist.exe may stop responding (hang).

During the site backup, the Backup service calls Machineinfo.bat (and therefore
Tlist.exe) to gather information that is needed by the administrator in case
rebuilding the site is necessary.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Copy the Pulist.exe file from the Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit to the
   Sms\Bin\I386 folder.

2. Use a text editor (such as Notepad) to open the Sms\Bin\I386\Machineinfo.bat
   file.

3. Find the line that reads:

   TLIST.EXE >>%2%3Data.txt

4. Replace the line with a new line that reads:

   PULIST.EXE >>%2%3Data.txt

5. Save and then close the Machineinfo.bat file.
