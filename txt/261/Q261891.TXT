TITLE   :XADM: Public Folder Size Displayed Incorr. If Larger Than 4.3 GB
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Public Folders that contain more than 4.3 gigabytes (GB) of content may report a
value of zero in the Exchange Server Administrator program under Public Folder
Resources.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because the data is calculated in the information store
as a MAPI property called PR_MESSAGE_SIZE. This variable is defined as an
unsigned long variable, which only holds 4.3 GB of content.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server. In Exchange
2000, the PR_MESSAGE_SIZE variable has been changed to PR_MESSAGE_SIZE_EXTENDED,
which is an 8-byte integer that holds as much as 16 terabytes of content.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The PR_MESSAGE_SIZE variable cannot be changed because the change can
potentially destabilize the information store.
