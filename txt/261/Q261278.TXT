SYMPTOMS
========

Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) client dial-in connections are always
answered on the first ring. You cannot configure Terminal Server to answer after
a different number of rings.

In Windows NT, you can use the following registry entry to configure the number
of rings:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan\Parameters\NumberOfRings

This entry has no effect in Terminal Server.

CAUSE
=====

The Telephony API services in Terminal Server do not check the configuration
data in the registry setting listed in the "Symptoms" section.

==========
