the sky.

CAUSE

box that is displayed on the screen when you start the game.

If you do not see this dialog box when you start the game:

1. On the Motocross Madness 2 startup screen, click Options ([GRAPHIC:the three
   gears]).

2. Click Advanced.

3. Click to select the "Show 3-D Renderer Selector at Startup" check box.

4. Click Back ([GRAPHIC:the pointing hand]) until you return to the Motocross
