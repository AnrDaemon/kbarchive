SUMMARY
=======

Network Monitor (Netmon.exe) is a packet-analyzing utility which is used
primarily to troubleshoot network communication problems. Network Monitor comes
with parsers which parse some of the most common protocols. However, as new
standards and implementations evolve, there will be certain protocols for which
Netmon does not contain parsers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Parsers for these protocols can be written by individuals, or, some of these
parsers are written by other companies and can be found on the Internet. In
addition, some of the additional parsers are included in the Microsoft Resource
kits.

The latest parsers usually include an autoinstall feature. Thus, all that is
required is for the end user to place a copy of the parser .dll into the Parser
subdirectory located under the Netmon installation directory. The location of
this directory depends on the folder chosen during installation.

When installing an older parser that does not include the autoinstall feature,
you need to modify a few files. These include the Parser.ini in the Netmon
directory, and the Tcpip.ini file, located under the Parser directory. The
necessary modifications for these files should be provided in the form of a
Readme.txt file or a similar file included with the parser.
