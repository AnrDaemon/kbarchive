SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to edit multiple mailbox properties by using
directory export and directory import, without opening individual mailbox
properties.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To begin the bulk edit process:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, click Microsoft Exchange, and then click
   Microsoft Exchange Administrator.

2. In the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, click Directory
   Export on the Tools menu.

3. In Directory Export, select an export file name.

4. Select the container and if necessary, the subcontainers, in which the
   mailboxes are located (the Recipients container).

5. Select the export object.

6. Leave the Logging Level (Low) and Character Set (ANSI) at their default
   settings.

7. If you have hidden mailboxes, click to select the Include Hidden Objects
   check box, and then click Export.

8. When the export is finished, open the <file_name>.csv file that you
   created in an appropriate program (Microsoft Excel, for example) and edit the
   values that you want to change. Save the modified .csv file.

NOTE: Microsoft recommends that you save a copy of the <file_name>.csv file
to a safe location before you begin to edit the file.

To import your changes:

1. In the Administrator program, click Directory Import on the Tools menu to
   import the <file_name>.csv file.

2. Leave the settings at the default settings.

3. Click Import File, and then select the appropriate <file_name>.csv
   file.

4. When the import is finished, the changes are made.
