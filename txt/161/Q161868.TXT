The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In a Word document, when you insert or update captions in a text box, the
captions may not be numbered correctly.

Case 1: When Captions Are Inserted into the Same Text Box
---------------------------------------------------------

Multiple captions inserted into the same text box have the same caption number.

Case 2: When Captions Are Inserted into Different Text Boxes
------------------------------------------------------------

Captions inserted in different text boxes are out of sequence with the captions
in the main document text.

Case 3: When Captions Are Inserted into Separate, Linked, Text Boxes
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Captions inserted into separate, linked, text boxes use an unexpected caption
number or have the same caption number.

CAUSE
=====

Case 1: Captions in the Same Text Box
-------------------------------------

Word can't correctly update multiple caption fields in the same text box. The
caption updating is based on the placement of the text box anchor in the main
text area of the document. Only one caption field can be associated with any one
text box anchor. Therefore, multiple caption fields in the same text box will be
given the same caption number.

Case 2: Captions in Multiple Text Boxes
---------------------------------------

Word updates caption fields based on the placement of the text box anchor. If
multiple text boxes are anchored to the same paragraph in the main text area of
the document, Word can't update the caption fields in the desired sequence.

Case 3: Captions in Linked Text Boxes
-------------------------------------

Each text box has an anchor in the main text area of the document. When text
boxes are linked, each text box retains its own anchor (there is not just one
anchor for all of the linked text boxes). Word cannot keep track of the multiple
anchors, and, therefore, the caption numbers are updated incorrectly.

WORKAROUND
==========

Case 1: Multiple Captions in a Single Text Box (Caption Numbers the Same)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

To work around this problem, place only one caption in a text box. If additional
captions are required in a text box, create another text box for the next
caption.

Case 2: Captions Out of Sequence
--------------------------------

Use the following steps to move the text box anchors to different paragraphs to
achieve the desired caption numbering sequence:

1. On the View menu, click Options.

2. Click the View tab.

3. Click the "Object Anchors" and "All" check boxes to select them, and then
   click OK.

4. Select the text box.

   Gray hatch marks and white square handles will appear around the outside edges
   of the text box. Also, an anchor will appear at a paragraph mark in the body
   of the document.

5. Drag the anchor to a different paragraph mark.

Case 3: Captions in Linked Text Boxes
-------------------------------------

To work around this problem, use any of the following options:

 - Do not use captions in linked text boxes.

   -or-

 - Use the following steps to unlink the text boxes:

   1. Select the first text box in the sequence.

   2. Right-click the selected text box.

   3. On the shortcut menu, click "Break Forward Link."

   Repeat this procedure for each text box containing a caption if you are
   working with multiple linked text boxes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
