The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows NT Event Viewer Application log of a Windows NT Server running the
TN3270 service may show repeated Event ID 903s. The event description is as
follows:

   Windows API ReadFileEx failed with error code 233L (No process is on the
   other end of the pipe.) in function TCPRecv.

   EXPLANATION
   An unexpected error was encountered on an Windows API call.

   ACTION
   Record message and contact technical support.

The TNServer traces will show a TN session initiated, but the response, DO TERM
TYPE, finds nothing to receive the message.

CAUSE
=====

This can be caused by Compaq Insight Manager's use of the standard TCP/IP
(Telnet) port 23.

RESOLUTION
==========

The TN3270 service can be configured to use a different port by editing the
<ntroot>\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC\SERVICES. For example, to configure the
TN3270 service to use Port 24, add the following line and restart the TN3270
service:

   telnet             23/tcp
   tn3270           24/tcp   #  TN3270 Service

NOTE: This also requires the TN clients to be configured to use this same port.
