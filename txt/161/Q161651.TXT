SYMPTOMS

When the SNMP Event Log Extension Agent is installed, the following event is
logged in the Windows NT Server Application Event Log:

      Event ID 2018
      Description: "SNMP Event Log Extension Agent is starting Version Beta 2;
      build 13."

This message occurs even though the service is the Systems Management Server 1.2
release version. This is a cosmetic problem, and can be ignored.

version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
