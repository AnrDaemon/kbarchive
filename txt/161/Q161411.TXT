======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

When starting Windows after having installed the Systems Management Server
client on a computer running Windows for Workgroups or Windows 95, the following
errors may appear:

   Cannot load C:\Windows\Vuser.386
   User.com running version 5 should be version 4

Further investigation may reveal the following:

 - Vuser.386 exists in the Windows\System directory.

 - There are two entries for Vuser in the System.ini file.

 - Wuser is in the Startup group.


MORE INFORMATION
----------------

The Intel LANDesk(R) Management Suite Remote Control is installed, either fully
or in part, on the client. LANDesk installs Vuser.386 in the Windows\System
directory. Systems Management Server installs Vuser.386 in the Windows
directory. The client cannot run both versions of Vuser.386 at the same time.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove the LANDesk client, as described in the
LANDesk documentation.
