SUMMARY
=======

When you open an object in Paint It!, the Paint It! server displays the previous
active tool and previous foreground color. The default tool selection is the
pencil and the default foreground color is black. It is possible for these
default selections to vary.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, if you do the following, the pencil tool in the toolbar is shown as
selected; however, the active tool is still the spraycan:

1. Insert a new Paint It! object into a client application such as WordPad.

2. Inside of the Paint It! server, select the spraycan using red as foreground
   color, and paint some stuff with it.

3. Click outside the object to return focus to client.

4. With the right mouse button, click the image, and click Paint It! Image
   Object.

5. Click Open.

RESULT: The pencil tool in the toolbar is shown as "selected"; however, the
active tool is still the spraycan. Both the selected and active color is still
red.

If you then close the image by clicking the Quit button, and then reopen the
image (via either Edit or Open), both the active and selected tools match
(pencil) and the color selections revert to Black/White.
