SUMMARY
=======

Automatic highlighting is useful in data entry boxes where you want to give the
user the option to overwrite the existing contents quickly by pressing any
character key.

This article demonstrates how to select (highlight) all text in a text box
automatically whenever the text box gets the focus. This example also applies to
the ComboBox and Grid control and any other controls that implement the Text,
SelStart, and SelLength properties.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start Visual Basic, or, if it is already running, click New Project from the
   File menu.

2. Place two Text Boxes on the Form1 form with the default settings.

3. Copy and paste the following code to the Form1 Code Window:

         Private Sub Text1_GotFocus()
           Call SelectMe(Me.ActiveControl)
         End Sub

         Private Sub Text2_GotFocus()
           Call SelectMe(Me.ActiveControl)
         End Sub

         Private Sub SelectMe(This As TextBox)
           This.SelStart = 0
           This.SelLength = Len(This.Text)
         End Sub

4. Press the F5 key to run the project, or click Run Project from the Tools
   menu.

As you move to each text box, the text is highlighted. If you begin typing, the
text will be replaced with your new entry. To deselect the text after giving
focus to the text box, you can single-click the text or press any of the TextBox
navigation keys (Home, End, Arrow-Keys).
