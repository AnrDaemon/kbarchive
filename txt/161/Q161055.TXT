The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

After printing a report, changing a setting in the Properties sheet causes
Visual FoxPro 5.0 to terminate. In Windows 95, the following error results:

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.

Pressing the Details button reveals the following message:

   VFP caused an invalid page fault in module VFP.EXE at <register
   address>.

This error does not occur when the report is previewed rather than printed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro
5.0a.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Type the following commands into the Command window:

         CREATE REPORT Test from HOME()+ "Labels"
         MODI REPORT Test

2. Minimize the Report Designer and issue the following command to print one
   record:

         REPORT FORM Test NEXT 1 TO PRINTER

   (without the quotation marks), and press the up arrow key. An "Invalid Page
   Fault" occurs.
