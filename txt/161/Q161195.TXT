TITLE   :OtherServers Parameter Fails on SNA Server 2.11 SP1 Clients
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server 2.11 Service Pack 1 clients cannot connect to SNA Servers outside of
their SNA subdomain, even though the OtherServers parameter is configured.

The SNA Server 3270 applet returns the following error message when this problems
occurs:

   No SNA Server found in domain.

The SNA Server 5250 applet returns the following error message when this problem
occurs:

   SNA Server has not been started. Contact System Administrator.

   Primary Return Code = F004
   Secondary Return Code = 010000F0

NOTE: This problem does not occur with the SNA Server 2.1 or 2.11 clients.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server 2.11 Service Pack 1 improved the resource location algorithm that SNA
Server clients use to locate an available LU/Pool for both APPC and EIS/3270
applications. The changes made to the resource location algorithm caused a
problem in which SNA Server 2.11 Service Pack 1 clients do not attempt to
connect to SNA Servers configured with the OtherServers parameter. SNA Server
Service Pack 1 clients only try to connect to the computer running SNA Server in
the client's SNA subdomain that are returned by the Sponsor server in the Get
Server List RPC response.

NOTE: This problem only occurs if the LU/Pool that is trying to be accessed by
the client is explicitly configured in the emulator/application. For 3270
emulators, the LU/Pool always has to be specified, so the problem occurs
consistently. For 5250/APPC applications, the problem does not occur if the
Local LU Alias is left blank.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated the following files to correct this problem:

   Windows 3.x Client: <winroot>\system\wdmod.dll
   Windows 95 Client: <snaroot>\system\snadmod.dll
   Windows NT Client: <snaroot>\system\snadmod.dll

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 2.11 Service
Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
