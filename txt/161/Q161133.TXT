SUMMARY
=======

You can prevent the CTRL+ALT+DEL and ALT+TAB key combinations from opening a
task list in Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Me by calling the
SystemParametersInfo function in the Win32 API. A step-by-step example of this
appears below.

NOTE: This is possible only in Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Me.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sometimes it is necessary for a program to prevent the use of the CTRL+ALT+DEL
key combination to open the Close Program task list to end a task or shut down
Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Me and to prevent the use of the ALT+TAB key
combination to switch tasks. The following technique uses the
SystemParametersInfo API to trick Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Me into
thinking that a screen saver is running. As a side effect, CTRL+ALT+DEL and
ALT+TAB are disabled.

The Win32 SDK states:

   "SPI_SCREENSAVERRUNNING Windows 95: Used internally; applications should not
   use this flag. Windows NT: Not supported."

Note that disabling CTRL+ALT+DEL is not recommended because the Close Program
dialog box was created to enable users to terminate misbehaving applications. If
a program "hangs" while CTRL+ALT+DEL is disabled, it may not be possible to
terminate it by any method other than rebooting the computer, which could result
in the loss of data. Also, this technique may not work in future versions of
Windows.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add two CommandButton controls (Command1 and Command2) to Form1.

3. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form1:

         Private Const SPI_SCREENSAVERRUNNING = 97&
         Private Declare Function SystemParametersInfo Lib "User32" _
             Alias "SystemParametersInfoA" _
            (ByVal uAction As Long, _
             ByVal uParam As Long, _
             lpvParam As Any, _
             ByVal fuWinIni As Long) As Long

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            Command1.Caption = "Disabled"
            Command2.Caption = "Enabled"
         End Sub

         Private Sub Form_Unload(Cancel As Integer)
            'Re-enable CTRL+ALT+DEL and ALT+TAB before the program terminates.
            Command2_Click
         End Sub

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            Dim lngRet As Long
            Dim blnOld As Boolean
            lngRet = SystemParametersInfo(SPI_SCREENSAVERRUNNING, True, _
            blnOld, _
               0&)
         End Sub

         Private Sub Command2_Click()
           Dim lngRet As Long
           Dim blnOld As Boolean
           lngRet = SystemParametersInfo(SPI_SCREENSAVERRUNNING, False, _
           blnOld, _
              0&)
         End Sub

4. Press the F5 key to run the program, and then click the "Disabled" button.
   CTRL+ALT+DEL and ALT+TAB are disabled. Click the "Enabled" button to enable
   CTRL+ALT+DEL and ALT+TAB again.
