TITLE   :XADM: Event 7042 During DS/IS Consistency Check
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After running a DS/IS Consistency Adjustment, mailboxes may not be created and
you may receive the following event in the Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 7042
   Source: MS Exchange IS Private
   Type: Error
   Category: Private IS/DS
   Error -2147221233 occurred while creating the Directory service object for
   mailbox /O=MICROSOFT/OU=SITE1/CN=TESTCONTAINER/CN=TEST32R.

CAUSE
=====

This error will occur if the Recipients Container that the mailbox is being
created in does not exist.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Create the correct recipients container and rerun the DS/IS Consistency
   Adjustment.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After restoring an offline backup of the Private Information Store to a new
Directory, a DS/IS Consistency Adjustment must be performed to re-create the
mailbox entries in the Directory. The DS/IS Consistency Adjustment will not
create Recipients Containers. The Recipient Container for that mailbox must
exist before running DS/IS Consistency.

In the example above, the mailbox "TEST32R" is being created in the container
called "TESTCONTAINER." If TESTCONTAINER does not exist, you will receive the
error above.
