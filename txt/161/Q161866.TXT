The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 3.x prompts you for a Domain Logon. If
you don't want to be prompted for the Domain Logon, you can prevent the
Microsoft Exchange client from prompting for it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To prevent the Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 3.x from prompting you for
a Domain Logon, use the following steps:

1. Check whether the Use Network Security During Logon option is selected. If
   this option is selected, you will log on to the computer running Microsoft
   Exchange Server using the same network security identity that you established
   when you logged on to your network. Select this option if your network logon
   identity gives you permission for your mailbox. If you clear this option, you
   will be prompted for your logon credentials when you start the Microsoft
   Exchange client. You can view the state of this option by doing the
   following:

   a. Start the Microsoft Exchange client.

   b. On the Tools menu, click Services.

   c. Select the Microsoft Exchange Server service.

   d. Click the Properties button.

   e. Click the Advanced tab.

2. Check whether you have a password list (.pwl) file. In Windows for
   Workgroups, password caching is a feature that maintains a list of the
   passwords that you have used, and the resources to which they apply.
   Passwords are saved and retrieved transparently to you. The password cache
   enables the restoration of connections to shared resources when you log on.
   This file should exist in the Windows directory, and appear as Username.pwl.
   If it does exist, it may be corrupted. Create a new one by deleting the old
   file and restarting both Windows for Workgroups and the Microsoft Exchange
   client. This will create a new .pwl file, so you should test it again.

3. Check whether real-mode IPX/SPX is your only network protocol. Real-mode
   IPX/SPX does not support named pipes, and this support is needed to make
   authenticated remote procedure calls (RPCs). If this is your only protocol,
   you must use a .pwl file to eliminate the domain logon prompt.

4. Check whether any of your installed protocols support named pipes. Again,
   named pipe support is required for authenticated RPCs. If none of your
   protocols support named pipes, you must use a .pwl file.

5. Check whether named pipes is first in the binding order. When the Microsoft
   Exchange client is installed, it sets the default RPC binding order that
   determines the order of network protocols that RPC attempts to bind over. If
   named pipes is first, verify that the Rpc16c1.dll file is present on the
   computer, make sure that the computer running Microsoft Exchange Server
   supports named pipes, and test it using Rping.exe. For more information about
   the RPC Ping troubleshooting tool, please refer to the Microsoft Exchange
   Administrator's Guide. If named pipes is not first, you can change the order
   on this computer by editing the Exchng.ini file in the Windows directory. For
   future installations from a network installation point, a Microsoft Exchange
   administrator can use the Microsoft Exchange Setup Editor to change the
   default binding order.
