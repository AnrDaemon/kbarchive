Windows folder.

SUMMARY
=======

Encarta 97 World Atlas plays a video as part of the opening sequence. If running
this video causes problems and keeps World Atlas from starting, you may need to
turn the opening video off.

This article discusses how to turn the opening video off using the Windows
registry.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To turn off the opening video, remove the information from the Value Data field
for the IntroFile string in the \KEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Microsoft
Reference\World Atlas\2.0 key in the Windows registry.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And Values
online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should make a
backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you edit the
registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95/98. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk. The registry is a system-wide database used for storing
Windows 95/98 software and hardware configuration settings.

To change the value of the IntroFile entry, do the following:

1. Click the Start button, and then click Run.

2. Type the following and click OK:

   "regedit" (without the quotation marks)

3. When the Registry Editor appears, double-click the HKEY_CURRENT_USER folder.

4. Double-click the Software folder, and then the Microsoft folder.

5. Double-click the Microsoft Reference folder, and then the World Atlas folder.

6. Double Click the 2.0 folder.

7. Double-click the IntroFile entry.

8. Delete the information in the Value Data field so that it is blank, and click
   OK.

9. Click Registry, and then click Exit.

10. Restart Encarta World Atlas. The opening video will now be disabled.
