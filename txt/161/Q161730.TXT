TITLE   :BUG: Cannot Set the Selected Item for a List box in Form Init
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbvfp kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp500bugkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual FoxPro 3.0 the selected item in a list box can be initialized by
placing the following code in the Form Init or the List box Init:

      THISFORM.List1.Selected(1) = .T.

This does not work in Visual FoxPro version 5.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

Place the following code in the Activate method of the form. The variable acts
like a switch so that the code is executed only when the form is first
instantiated. The variable switch should be added to the form as a property.
Switch is initialized to false.

      IF !THISFORM.switch
        THISFORM.List1.Selected(1)= .T.
        THISFORM.switch = .T.
      ENDIF

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form and add the employee table to the DataEnvironment.

2. Add a list box to the form and set its RowSourceType to 6-Fields. Set its
   RowSource to employee.emp_id.

3. Place the following code in the Init of the form or the Init of the list
   box.

         THISFORM.List1.Selected(1)= .T.

Note that when the form is run, the first item is not selected.
