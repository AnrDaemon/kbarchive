Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start 16-bit or 32-bit Visual Basic 4.0, or if it is already running, click
   New Project on the File menu.

2. Add a data control and a DBGrid Control to the Form1 form. Set the controls
   to the following properties:

   Control         Default Name        Property            Setting
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
   Data              Data1            DatabaseName        Biblio.mdb
                                      RecordSource        Titles

   DBGrid            DBGrid1          DataSource          Data1

3. Right-click the DBGrid control and click Retrieve Fields. Note that the
   column headers are now set to field names from the Titles table.

4. Right-click the DBGrid control and click Properties to open the Properties
   page. Click the Columns Tab and choose Column1 (Year Published) in the Column
   list box. In the Number Format Combo box, enter ##. The "Year Published"
   field is of type Integer in the database. Click OK to close the Properties
   page.

5. On the Run menu, click Start or press the F5 key to start the program. The
   Year Published column still appears with four instead of two digits.
