The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log onto a workstation configured with an IBM MWave Modem, and are
using the Logon Using Dial-up Networking feature in Windows NT 4.0, you receive
the following error message:

   Error 692: Hardware failure in port or attached device.

CAUSE
=====

The IBM MWave Modem is not initialized until the Mwmwin.exe file is executed.
This file is executed when you log on to Windows NT 4.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain updated MWave drivers from IBM.

As a workaround, log on to Windows NT using a local account, then log off. This
will allow Windows NT to correctly use the Logon Using Dial-Up Networking
option.
