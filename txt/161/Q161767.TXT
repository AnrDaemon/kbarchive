TITLE   :Wnap.exe GP Faults During a Windows NT Password Change
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11 SP1,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11 SP1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

During a Windows NT password change, the SNA Server Windows 3.x client software
may encounter a general protection fault (GPF) and display the following error:

   WNAP caused a General Protection Fault in module WDMOD.DLL at 0015:038E

This problem occurs if the combined user ID and domain name field length is seven
or eight characters. This problem may also lead to a buffer pool corruption
error on the server, causing SnaBase to fail abnormally with the following
Windows NT application event log errors:

   Event: 624
   Source: SNA Server
   Creating dump file C:\SNA\traces\snadump.log for SNABASE.EXE

   Event: 686
   Source: SNA Base Service
   SNA Server Internal buffer pool error.
    Reason  = Invalid Owner Id
    Module  = C:\SNA\system\SNABASE.EXE
    Process = 143
    Pool    = TRUSTED ELTS
    Details = Current Owner Id <value>, Correct ID <value>

NOTE: The SNA Server 2.0, 2.1 and 2.11 Windows 3.x clients do not support the
Windows NT password change feature if the user's password has expired or if the
user is required to change his or her password on the next logon. Password
change support was added to the SNA Server Windows 3.x client software in 2.11
Service Pack 1.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server client improperly generates the client logon response to send to
the server when the combined user ID and domain are seven or eight characters
long. In some cases, this causes an invalid message to be sent to the server,
leading to an SnaBase buffer pool error.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 2.11 Service
Pack 1 and 3.0.


A supported fix is now available, and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack
that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more
information.
