TITLE   :Event 0 Source 0: ExIfStart Registry Key for Server Not Found 2l
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINNT:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the computer running Windows NT Server is also running Cheyenne software
Arcserver backup software, Windows NT Server periodically generates events that
have no source or event ID. The message is:

   ExIfStart Registry key for server not found 2l.

CAUSE
=====

Arcserve uses Raima database software as part of its backup package. During the
Arcserve installation process, this database software is not installed; only a
database file and a software piece for it are installed.

A Raima executable file named Rds.exe runs as part of the backup process, and it
looks for the registry entry ExIfStart. Because the full Raima installation has
not been run, the entry is not there.

Note that the error message is harmless, and does not affect either Windows NT or
the backup process.

STATUS
======

The Cheyenne ArcServe tape backup software is manufactured by Cheyenne Software,
Inc., a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or
otherwise, regarding this product's performance or reliability.
