TITLE   :XCLN: Schedule+ Error: "The Schedule File Could Not Be Opened"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbinterop kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open another person's appointment book in Schedule+, you
encounter one of the following errors, depending on the version of Windows you
are running:

 - Windows NT Workstation:

   The schedule file could not be opened. An unknown error occurred.

 - Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups 3.11, or Windows 95:

   The logon credentials supplied were incorrect. Make sure your username and
   domain are correct, then type your password again.

CAUSE
=====

Attempting to open a schedule on a server that is in another site in an
untrusted domain causes this error. This problem occurs with both site
connectors and X.400 connectors.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set up a two-way trust between the domains in which each of the computers
running Microsoft Exchange Server is located.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Schedule+ reads the remote user's home server from the local directory service
and then uses remote procedure calls (RPCs) to connect to the remote Information
Store. Because the mailbox is in an untrusted domain, the error described above
occurs.
