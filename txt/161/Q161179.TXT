TITLE   :WinSock Zero-Length Packet Not Sent on Network
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork osr2 win95 kbAPI kbSDKPlatform kbWinsock kbGrpDSNetkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Windows 95, if the Windows Sockets Send() function is used to send
zero-length packets using a stream-oriented socket over IPX/SPX, the function
returns a success status, but no packet is sent on the network.

CAUSE
=====

The WinSock specifications do not require that a Send() function with a length
of zero actually result in a packet being sent over the network when the Send()
function is called on a stream-oriented socket. Windows 95 does not actually
send a packet across the network when the Send() function is called with a
length of zero over a stream-oriented socket over SPX/IPX.


RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

According to the WinSock 2.0 specification, calling the Send() function with a
length of zero is to be treated by implementations as successful. In this case,
the Send() function may return 0 as a valid return value. For message-oriented
sockets, a zero-length transport datagram is sent.
