SUMMARY
=======

Occasionally it may be necessary to use the emergency repair disk (ERD) to
repair a single system file that is known to be bad, or to skip a single file
while repairing all others. Unfortunately, if the affected file is not near the
top of the list in the Setup.log file, it may take considerable time to click
through each of the files until the correct file appears. This article outlines
a procedure to work around this issue.

WORKAROUND
==========

To repair a single bad file or to skip a file while repairing all others,
complete the following steps:

1. Remove the attributes from the Setup.log file by typing the following at the
   command line:

   attrib -r -h -s a:\Setup.log

2. Copy the Setup.log file from the floppy to a second computer.

3. Use a text editor such as Notepad to modify Setup.log.

4. From the Search pull-down menu, use the Find command to locate the desired
   file.

5. Select the entire line that the file is in, delete the line with the Cut
   command, then Paste it at the top of list, immediately under the heading:

   [Files.WinNT]

6. Save the modified Setup.log file back to the floppy disk, maintaining the
   original on the second computer so it can be restored if needed.

7. Run the ERD. The first file that will appear is NTLDR. You may either skip
   (press ESC) or select repair of this file, as desired.

   The next file to appear will be the file that you moved to the top of the
   list. If this is the only file that must be repaired, select the replace
   option (press ENTER) and then select F3 to exit the repair process. The
   desired file will be repaired leaving all others untouched.

   If this file is to be skipped and all other files repaired, skip the File
   (press ESC) and then select repair all (press A) to perform repair Of all
   remaining files.
