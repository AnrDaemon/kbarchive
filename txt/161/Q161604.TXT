TITLE   :SMS: PGC Application Is Reset with a "Configure" Status
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPGC smspgc

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A shared network application is required to rerun the one-time configuration
script after it has been successfully configured.

CAUSE
=====

If a package property is changed for a shared network application, the network
applications database (NAD) timestamp for that shared network application is
updated as well.

When Program Group Control (PGC) runs on the client, it resets the package status
in the client registry from "Status=Success" to "Status=Configure." This forces
the application to run the one-time installation again.


STATUS
------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft
Systems Management Server 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
(without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K

MORE INFORMATION
----------------

The package property may have been updated by the administrator, or it may have
been updated as the result of a NAD update triggered by a Systems Management
Server utility (the ones provided in the Support or PSSTools directories of the
Systems Management Server compact disc).

Minimizing changes to the packages reduces the frequency of having to reinstall
any shared network applications.
