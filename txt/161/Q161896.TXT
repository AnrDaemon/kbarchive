SUMMARY
=======

In Chapter 28 of the Microsoft Visual FoxPro "Developer's Guide," section
"Building and Debugging Libraries and ActiveX Controls," you are directed to
"Set Ignore all default libraries" in the project link settings.

If you set this option, the following link error may occur when building an FLL
or OCX:

   error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __DllMainCRTStartup@12

The "Ignore all default libraries" check box in the Link tab of the Project
Settings dialog box should be unmarked in order to build an FLL or OCX.
