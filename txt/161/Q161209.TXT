The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When resizing your ActiveX control on a host form, the component controls or
user-drawn graphics do not get resized.

CAUSE
=====

You do not have logic in the Resize event of the UserControl object to resize
the component control(s) to the new size, or in the Paint event of the
UserControl object to redraw the user-drawn graphics.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add code to the UserControl's Resize and/or paint event to resize the component
control(s) and user-drawn graphics.

STATUS
======

This is behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Even though you may want to have various effects when the developer resizes your
ActiveX control, Visual Basic has no way of determining how to handle resize
issues of your component controls. You can place code in the UserControl_Resize
event to handle the resizing in whatever manner you wish.

If your control has no component controls, the UserControl_Paint event allows you
to redraw the user-drawn graphics.

Several examples are included below. All code is in the UserControl object.

Resizing a Single Control
-------------------------

The control is resized to fill the entire UserControl by using the following
code:

         Private Sub UserControl_Resize()
           Text1.Move 0, 0 , ScaleWidth, ScaleHeight
         End Sub

Resizing a Control and a Label Side-by-Side
-------------------------------------------

The label occupies the leftmost 20% of the user control. The textbox occupies the
rightmost 75% of the user control. A 5% gap exists between them, as shown here:

         Private Sub UserControl_Resize()
           Label1.Move 0, 0 , ScaleWidth * .2, ScaleHeight
           Text1.Move ScaleWidth * .25, 0, ScaleWidth * .75, ScaleHeight
         End Sub

Resizing a Shape Control with a Label Drawn Part-Way Down
---------------------------------------------------------

The shape control fills the entire UserControl. The label occupies the full width
and is drawn slightly above center as shown here:

         Private Sub UserControl_Resize()
           Shape1.Move 0, 0 , ScaleWidth, ScaleHeight
           Label1.Move 0, (ScaleHeight - Label1.Height) * .4, ScaleWidth
         End Sub

The height of the label is assumed not to change in this example. To change label
height to be 30% of the UserControl height, add the 4th argument to the Move
method:

         Label1.Move 0, ScaleHeight * .28, ScaleWidth, ScaleHeight * .3

The change of the second argument to ScaleHeight * .28 is obtained by
substituting ScaleHeight * .3 for Label1.Height, giving:

         (ScaleHeight - ScaleHeight * .3) * .4
         (ScaleHeight * .7) * .4
         ScaleHeight * .28

Resizing User-Drawn Graphics
----------------------------

The code draws a border around the UserControl and puts an 'X' in it. The
ScaleMode needs to be in pixels for the border to paint correctly:

         Private Sub UserControl_Paint()
           UserControl.ScaleMode = vbPixels
           UserControl.Line (0, 0)-(ScaleWidth - 1, ScaleHeight - 1), 0, B
           UserControl.Line (0, 0)-(ScaleWidth - 1, ScaleHeight - 1), 0
           UserControl.Line (0, ScaleHeight - 1)-(ScaleWidth - 1, 0), 0
         End Sub
