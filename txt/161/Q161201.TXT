TITLE   :NTBackup.exe from WinNT 3.51 SP5 Causes Verify Errors
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After installing Service Pack 5 on Windows NT 3.51, you may start to see verify
errors in NTBackup. The errors you see, in either your NTbackup screen or
Backup.log, will have the following format:

   *File information found on tape:
   *%FileName% %Size% %Date% %Time%
   *File information found on disk:
   *%FileName% %Size% %Date% %Time%
   *Difference encountered in alternate file data.
   *The file %FileName% is different.

The problem seems to occur more frequently on Macintosh or large NTFS volumes.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by NTBackup checking the stream size of the data which may change
every time you run backup.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem seems to be more of a nuisance than actual file problems, but can
cause NTBackup to degrade in performance, especially on large volumes. So far,
we have not seen any cases which actually showed file corruption. You can simply
choose not to verify after backup or apply the Hotfix available as mentioned
below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
