TITLE   :RCMD Strips Quotes from the Command Line
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbuikbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Rcmd.exe from the Windows NT Server 4.0 Resource Kit and Windows NT
Workstation 4.0 Resource Kit to create a remote command that requires quotation
marks around its parameter(s), you receive an error.

See the following example:

   C:\> rcmd \\myserver net start "computer browser"
   Executing on \\myserver: net start computer browser

   The service name is invalid.

   More help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 2185.

   Remote server \\myserver disconnected

CAUSE
=====

RCMD strips the quotation marks from the command line (note this behavior on the
second line of the previous example) that results in a single multi- word
parameter being interpreted as two parameters.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem was corrected in the Supplement Three. Supplements are available
for download from the following Microsoft Press Web site:

Additional query words: quotes ignore ignoring
