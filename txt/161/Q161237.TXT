TITLE   :PRB: Apply Button on Custom OCX Property Page Always Disabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When changing properties of a custom ActiveX control via a custom property page,
the Apply button is never enabled.

CAUSE
=====

The Changed property is not being set from the property page code.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the property page code, add the line:

        Changed = True

to all code that changes UserControl properties.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Visual Basic IDE or run-time system controls the state of the Apply Button
on your custom property pages. In order to tell Visual Basic that the user has
edited one or more properties on a property page, you must set the PropertyPage
object's Changed property to True. Because there is no way to know which
property a user might decide to change, you must do this for every property
displayed on the page.

The following code snippet illustrates using the Changed property in property
page code:

         Private Sub ControlCaption_Changed()
           Changed = True
         End Sub

         Private Sub ApplyChanges()
         Dim X As Variant
           For Each X In SelectedControls
             X.Caption = ControlCaption.Text
           Next X
         End Sub

This process can be simplified by using the Property Page Wizard from the Visual
Basic Add-Ins menu.
