TITLE   :Printing Italics to a LexMark Printer Produces Incorrect Output
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When printing italicized text using the 12 point Times New Roman font on an IBM
or LexMark PostScript printer, incorrect output may result. The italicized
letters overwrite the preceding space. Increasing the number of different fonts
and point sizes, or including graphics makes the problem more pronounced.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Windows NT substitutes the TrueType font for a
PostScript font that resides on the printer to help speed printing. The drivers
use the metrics from the substituted PostScript font instead of the TrueType
font when placing the characters.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two workarounds to this issue:

1. In the Printers folder, select the printer then click Document Defaults from
   the File menu.

2. Find the TrueType Font option on the Advanced tab.

3. Change it to Download As Soft Font.

- or -

1. In the Printers folder, select the printer and then click Properties from the
   File menu.

2. Find the Font Substitution option on the Device Settings tab.

3. Change it to Slow but More Accurate.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
