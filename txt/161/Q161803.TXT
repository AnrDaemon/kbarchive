SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Installation Guide states on page 38 that the default
SMTP site address is obtained from the user, organization, and site names. It
illustrates this with an incorrect SMTP address format, as shown below:

   user@organization.site.com

The site name should precede the organization name in order to work properly. The
correct format for the default SMTP address of a recipient should appear as
follows:

   user@site.organization.com

Additional query words: internet domain
