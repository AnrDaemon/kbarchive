OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the FTP Service included with Internet Information Server (IIS) versions 1.0
and 2.0, if you have write permissions you can overwrite an existing file with
the FTP RNTO command.

NOTE: This issue will also occur on the Microsoft FTP Server Service in Windows
NT version 3.1 through version 3.51.


WORKAROUND
==========

Create an automated process to copy existing FTP upload files to a separate
directory that is not available to the FTP client. This would eliminate the
overwriting of existing files through the FTP clients' use of the FTP RNTO
command.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Server.
