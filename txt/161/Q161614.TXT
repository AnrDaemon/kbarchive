SYMPTOMS
========

If you do not specify a search direction when using the Microsoft Visual Basic
for Applications Find property, the search routine may go to the next instance
of a search string, the previous instance, or nothing happens.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs by design because the search function of Word remembers the
last direction and uses this as the default for the next search.

The following Find Object properties determine the search direction and whether
the search continues after you reach the beginning or end of the document:

Forward Argument
----------------

The Forward argument specifies the direction to search. When you set the value to
True, the macro searches toward the end of the document. When you set the value
to False, the macro searches toward the beginning of the document.

Wrap Property
-------------

The Wrap property returns or sets the event that occurs when the search begins at
a point other than the beginning of the document or if the search text is not
found in the specified selection or range. The Wrap property can use any of the
following WdFindWrap constants:

Constant         Description
--------         -----------

wdFindAsk        After searching the selection or range, Word displays a
                 message asking whether to search the remainder of the
                 document.

wdFindContinue   The find operation continues when the beginning or end of
                 the search range is reached.

WdFindStop       The find operation ends when the beginning or end of the
                 search range is reached.

The following Visual Basic for Applications examples set the search direction:

Searching Downward
------------------

The following macro example searches downward. When it reaches the end of the
document, it prompts you to continue searching from the beginning of the
document:

      Sub SearchDown()
         Selection.Find.ClearFormatting
         With Selection.Find
            .Text = "Word"
            .Forward = True
            .Wrap = wdFindAsk
         End With
         Selection.Find.Execute
      End Sub

Searching Upward
----------------

The following macro example searches upward. When it reaches the beginning of the
document, it prompts you to continue searching from the end of the document:

      Sub SearchUp()
         Selection.Find.ClearFormatting
            With Selection.Find
               .Text = "Word"
               .Forward = False
               .Wrap = wdFindAsk
            End With
            Selection.Find.Execute
      End Sub

Searching the Entire Document
-----------------------------

The following macro example searches the entire document. It does not prompt you
to continue searching when you reach the beginning or the end of the document:

      Sub SearchEntireDocument()
         Selection.Find.ClearFormatting
         With Selection.Find
            .Text = "Word"
            .Forward = True
            .Wrap = wdFindContinue
         End With
         Selection.Find.Execute
      End Sub
