SUMMARY
=======

This article lists steps to help you troubleshoot problems when you attempt to
connect to the Internet Mail Server from an e-mail client using post office
protocol version 3 (POP3). These steps are based on information in the Request
for Comments (RFC) 1725 and RFC 1939 specifications.

Basic Troubleshooting
---------------------

If you are unable to connect to the Internet Mail Server from an e-mail client
using POP3, use the following steps to troubleshoot the problem. After
performing each step, check to see if the issue has been resolved.

1. Verify that the e-mail client is POP3-compliant. Many e-mail clients are not
   POP3-compliant. In particular, many newer e-mail clients support Internet
   Mail Access Protocol version 4 (IMAP4). Microsoft Exchange Server versions
   4.0 and 5.0 do not support IMAP4. For IMAP4 support you must upgrade to
   Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. Microsoft Exchange Server supports
   POP3 as defined in the RFC 1725, RFC 1734, RFC 1939, and RFC 1953
   specifications.

2. Use the Telnet tool to connect to the Microsoft Exchange Server. To do so,
   follow these steps:

   a. On the e-mail client, start Telnet. For the host name, type the name of
      the Microsoft Exchange Server computer, and for the port type, type 110.
      If a "term type" is requested, do not type anything. For example, type the
      following command to start Telnet:

   telnet <server> 110

      where <server> is the name of the Microsoft Exchange Server computer.
      If you are running Windows 95, Windows NT Workstation, or Windows NT
      Server, you can type the above command at a command prompt or in the Run
      dialog box. If you are running Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server
      version 3.51, you can open the Run dialog box from the File menu or the
      task list.

      When you type the above command and then press ENTER, a message similar to
      the following should be displayed:

   +OK Microsoft Exchange POP3 server version 5.0.1457.10 ready

      NOTE: The version number might be different, but it should be 5.0.1457.10
      or later.

   b. Enable local echo for the current Telnet session. To do so, on the
      Terminal menu, click Preferences, click the Local Echo check box to select
      it, and then click OK.

   c. Type the following command, and then press ENTER: user
      <domain>\<username>\<mailbox> where <domain> is
      the name of the domain in which the user's account is located,
      <username> is the user name, and <mailbox> is the user's
      mailbox. Note that the <mailbox> portion of the above command is
      only necessary if it is different from the <username> portion. When
      you press ENTER, "+OK" (without quotation marks) should be displayed.

   d. Type the following command, and then press ENTER:

   pass <password>

      where <password> is the user's password. When you press ENTER, the
      following message should be displayed:

   +OK User successfully logged on

   e. To determine if the user has new messages, type "stat" (without quotation
      marks), and then press ENTER. After you press ENTER, the following message
      should be displayed:

   +OK <x><yyyy>

      where <x> is the number of new messages and <yyyy> is the total
      size of the messages in bytes. This is known as a "drop listing."

   f. To end the Telnet session, type "quit" (without quotation marks), and then
      press ENTER. When you press ENTER, a message similar to the following
      should be displayed:

   +OK Microsoft Exchange POP3 server version 5.0.1457.10 signing off

NOTE: The above POP3 commands can only be used to troubleshoot problems when you
attempt to receive messages. A POP3 client uses Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
(SMTP) to send messages. For information about how troubleshoot problems when
you attempt to send messages, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

Additional Troubleshooting
--------------------------

If the problem still occurs, perform these steps. After performing each step,
check to see if the issue has been resolved.

1. Verify that the POP3 protocol is enabled for the site Protocols container and
   the Protocols container on the server.

2. Verify that POP3 support is not disabled for the user's mailbox.

3. Verify that the client can ping the server using the server's Internet
   protocol (IP) address and the server's computer name.

4. Run the Rpings.exe tool that is located on the Microsoft Exchange Server
   CD-ROM. Rpings.exe runs on the server; a client program must also be run on
   the client. If you are running Windows or Windows for Workgroups version 3.x,
   run Rpingc16.exe on the client. If you are running Windows 95, Windows NT
   Server, or Windows NT Workstation, run Rpingc32.exe on the client.

   NOTE: The Rpings.exe tool is used to determine if the client can connect to
   the server using remote procedure call (RPC). POP3 clients do not connect to
   the Microsoft Exchange Server computer using RPC.

5. Try to use the Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client to connect to the server
   from the same computer on which Microsoft Exchange Server is installed.

6. Try using a different e-mail client. For example, use Microsoft Outlook with
   the Internet Mail information service in the client profile or use Microsoft
   Outlook Express.

7. Verify that the Private information store database is consistent and not
   corrupt. This can cause POP3 login's to fail and POP3 sessions to hang after
   a command has been issued.


If the problem still occurs, contact the manufacturer of the e-mail client for
additional assistance.
