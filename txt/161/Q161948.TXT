TITLE   :XCON: MTA NDRs Messages with Headers in P2 Part of Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server Message Transfer Agent (MTA) may not deliver
incoming mail that includes headers in the P2 part of the message that comply
with RFC 1327. If this is the case, the Microsoft Exchange Server MTA generates
a nondelivery report (NDR) to the sender. Incoming mail from Innosoft's PMDF has
exhibited this behavior.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange Server MTA does not recognize the RFC 1327 headers, and
thus rejects the mail message.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below. With the hotfix,
the MTA now allows these headers to pass through without generating an NDR.
However, the MTA neither interprets the RFC 1327 headers, nor acts on them.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

The P2 part of a message is a header that describe the message and how the
receiving MTA should deal with it. RFC 1327, "Mapping between X.400(1988) / ISO
10021 and RFC 822," equates headers of like functionality between Internet mail
and X.400 mail. Internet mail headers primarily come from RFC 822, but there
have been later RFCs (for example, MIME) that augment the RFC 822 headers.
