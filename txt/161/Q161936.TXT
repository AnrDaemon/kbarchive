TITLE   :XCON: Wrong Mapping of Msg Priority Between MSMAIL and Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Messages sent with normal priority from Microsoft Mail Windows clients go
through the low priority queue in the Microsoft Exchange message transfer agent
(MTA).

This problem does not affect the priority displayed in the recipient mailbox but
only affects the order in which the MTA handles the three queues, high, normal,
and low.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0 This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that high priority messages sent by Microsoft Mail users go through the
normal priority queue in the Microsoft Exchange MTA if the Microsoft Mail users
haven't been granted the right "Urgent" by Microsoft Mail administrators.

With the right "Urgent," these messages go through the high priority queue in
Exchange MTA.
