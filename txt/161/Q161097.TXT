registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SUMMARY
=======

Cinemania 1997 plays a full-screen video as part of the opening sequence. If
running the video is causing problems with your computer and keeping Cinemania
from starting, you may need to turn the opening video off.

This article discusses how to turn the opening video off using the Windows
registry.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To turn the opening video off, do the following:

 - Go to the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Reference Titles\Cinemania 97\
   key in the Windows 95 registry and change the value of the StartupVideo entry
   to 0.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And Values
online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should make a
backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you edit the
registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk. The registry is a system-wide database used for storing
Windows software and hardware configuration settings.

   "regedit" (without the quotation marks)
