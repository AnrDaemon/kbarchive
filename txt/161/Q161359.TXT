TITLE   :PRB: Class Names in VFP 5.0 are Case Sensitive

KEYWORDS:kbvfp300 kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, Professional Edition, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When referencing an object class or base class for comparison, the class name is
case sensitive.

When testing the class property of a command button and comparing the property
setting to the string "commandbutton" rather than "Commandbutton," the code
fails. The 'c' in Commandbutton must be capitalized.

RESOLUTION
==========

The text used for comparison must match the property setting exactly.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form with a command button. The base class is Commandbutton and the
   class is Commandbutton.

2. Place the following code in the Click event of a command button:

         i=1
         FOR i = 1 to ThisForm.ControlCount
            IF ThisForm.Controls(i).Class = "commandbutton" THEN
               WAIT WINDOW ThisForm.Controls(i).Name
            ELSE
               WAIT WINDOW "This is not a Command Button:  "  + ;
                            ThisForm.Controls(i).Name
            ENDIF
         NEXT i

The code above returns a Wait window indicating the commandbutton class is not a
command button because the 'c' in commandbutton is lowercase. Replace the
lowercase "c" with an uppercase "C," and it works properly.

Replace:

      IF ThisForm.Controls(i).Class = "commandbutton" THEN

With:

      IF ThisForm.Controls(i).Class = "Commandbutton" THEN
