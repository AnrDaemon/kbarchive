PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe

SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain conditions, you may notice that duplicate database entries appear
in the Open SourceSafe Database dialog box. These entries contain identical path
references and have a ~x appended to the end of the database name (where x is
some integer). The following are examples of this type of duplicate entry:

   Database Name                   Path
   ===================             =================
   \\RIGEL\PHYDEAUX\               \\RIGEL\PHYDEAUX\ 
   \\RIGEL\PHYDEAUX\~1             \\RIGEL\PHYDEAUX\ 
   \\RIGEL\PHYDEAUX\~2             \\RIGEL\PHYDEAUX\ 
   \\RIGEL\PHYDEAUX\~3             \\RIGEL\PHYDEAUX\ 

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs under the following two conditions:

Condition 1

All of the following three circumstances must exist:

1. You added a database to the Open SourceSafe Database dialog box by typing in
   the path to the SRCSAFE.INI instead of locating the file with the Browse
   command.

2. The database that you added is located on a network drive.

3. You start the Visual SourceSafe Explorer by using the -s switch and pointing
   it to the database that you added.

Condition 2

1. You start the Visual SourceSafe Explorer using the -s switch and pointing it
   to a database that does not yet appear in the Open SourceSafe Database dialog
   box. Each subsequent time you start the Visual SourceSafe Explorer using this
   method, a new duplicate entry is added to the Open SourceSafe Database dialog
   box.

RESOLUTION
==========

If Condition 1 exists, use the Browse capabilities to locate the SRCSAFE.INI
file instead of typing in the path.

If Condition 2 exists, make sure that the database referenced through the -s
switch already resides in the list of available databases.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

Condition 1

1. Open or switch to the Visual SourceSafe Explorer.

2. On the File menu, click Open SourceSafe Database. Click Browse.

3. Type the complete UNC path to a SRCSAFE.INI file that resides on a server
   into the File text box. For example:

      \\RIGEL\PHYDEAUX\SRCSAFE.INI

4. Click Open (this closes the Find Database dialog box). Click OK to close the
   Browse for the Visual SourceSafe Database dialog box.

5. Click Cancel to close the Open SourceSafe Database dialog box (this prevents
   the new database reference from becoming the default). Close the Visual
   SourceSafe Explorer.

6. Create a shortcut or an icon with the following command line:

   <drive letter>:\VSS\win32\SSEXP.EXE -s<UNC Path to newly added database>

   where <drive letter> is the drive containing your Visual SourceSafe
   installation and <UNC Path to newly added database> is the UNC path to
   the Visual SourceSafe database added in steps 2, 3, and 4.

7. Start the Visual SourceSafe Explorer using the new icon or shortcut several
   times. Note that each time you start the Visual SourceSafe Explorer, an
   additional database reference is added to the Open SourceSafe Database dialog
   box.

Condition 2

1. Open or switch to the Visual SourceSafe Explorer.

2. On the File menu, click Open SourceSafe Database. Remove all database entries
   except the current database, and then close the Visual SourceSafe Explorer.

3. Create a shortcut or icon with the following command line:

    <drive letter>:\VSS\win32\SSEXP.EXE -s<UNC Path to alternate database>

   where <drive letter> is the drive containing your Visual SourceSafe
   installation and <UNC Path to alternate database> is the UNC path to
   any Visual SourceSafe database (residing on a server) other than the current
   default (that is, the one that was left in the Open SourceSafe Database
   dialog box in step 2).

4. Start the Visual SourceSafe Explorer using the new icon or shortcut several
   times. Note that each time you start the Visual SourceSafe Explorer, an
   additional database reference is added to the Open SourceSafe Database dialog
   box.
