SUMMARY
=======

If you have closed captioning enabled and start one of the report videos for The
Magic School Bus Explores the Rainforest (MSB Rainforest), the closed captioning
dialog remains on the screen after the animation/video is dismissed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The closed captioning dialog box is located at the bottom of the screen,
fluctuates in size, and its duration is based on an internal timer. After the
report animation/video is dismissed by clicking outside the video window, the
animation/video will stop, but the closed captioning dialog will remain until
the timer expires. After the timer expires, the closed captioning dialog returns
to black.
