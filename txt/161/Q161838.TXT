TITLE   :Programs That Lock 0 Bytes at Byte 0 Lock Entire File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The client program opens a file on the server and locks 0 bytes at position (0).
After this "lock_0_bytes_at_position_0," the same client cannot lock any other
byte_range of that file (lock_i_bytes_at position_j, with i>0, j>0).

CAUSE
=====

The locking mechanism incorrectly calculated the lock to be the entire file,
instead of 0.


RESOLUTION
==========

Run a different application that can lock a byte range other than 0 bytes at
location byte 0 before running the application that will lock 0 bytes at byte 0.
This will then cause the 0 byte locking application to function correctly.

-or-

Apply the hotfix for Windows NT 4.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
