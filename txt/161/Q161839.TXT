KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain circumstances, messages sent from a Microsoft Exchange Server
Internet Mail Connector (IMC) appear to have been sent 13 hours in the future.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
4.0. Most occurrences of this problem were fixed in Microsoft Exchange Server
4.0 Service Pack 4. However, this problem may still occur with inbound messages
that are not in Rich Text Format (RTF) after Service Pack 4 is applied. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs when all of the following conditions are met:

 - The time zone setting on the server is set to "(GMT+1200) Wellington,
   Auckland".

 - The "Automatically adjust clock for daylight saving changes" check box is
   selected.

 - It is daylight saving time in the country where the IMC is located.
