TITLE   :Permissions on WWW Default File Creates Access Denied Error Msg.
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:Winnt:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Internet Information Server (IIS) administrator sets file permissions on
the predefined default file in a WWW publication directory, a client browser may
get an access denied error, without the opportunity to provide validation.

CAUSE
=====

If an IIS 1.0 administrator applies permissions to the default file in a WWW
publication directory when a browser executes a URL (for example,
HTTP://myserver), the browser may receive an access denied without returning a
logon dialog request. If the full URL is provided to the default file (for
example, HTTP://myserver/default.htm), the browser will return a logon dialog
request.

WORKAROUND
==========

Set the appropriate user permissions on the specific WWW publication Directory,
as well as the default file within the directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Server version 1.0. This problem has been fixed in Internet Information Server
version 2.0.
