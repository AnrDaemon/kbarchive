TITLE   :SMS Doc Err: Help Indicates Use of Colons in Machine Path
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdocerr kbsmsAdmin smsadmin smsdocerr

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The online Help for the Job Details of a "Run Command on Workstation" job
indicates that you should use colons to separate the site code, domain, and
computer name of the Machine Path. However, using this syntax results in errors
from the Systems Management Server Scheduler, and the job is not processed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the pipe character (|) instead of the colon.
For example, instead of this syntax

      site:domain:computername

Use:

      site|domain|computername

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using the incorrect syntax causes the following event in the application log of
the site server:

   Event ID: 319 Source: SMS

   The job encountered an error trying to process the specified machine path
   (REV:REVDOM:NTWKS) and therefore cannot generate the list of target
   workstations for the job.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
