SUMMARY
=======

Roaming Profiles contain user work environments, which include the desktop items
and settings. Some examples of these environments are screen colors, mouse
settings, window size and position, and network and printer connections. Roaming
Profiles are available wherever the user logs on, provided the server is
available.

1. On a computer running Windows NT Server 4.0, create a dedicated account with
   administrative rights as Profile Administrator. Create this account in User
   Manager for Domains and log on to this account to preconfigure user
   environmental settings.

2. In User Manager for Domains, use the User Environment Profile dialog box to
   add the user profile path location. Open the User Properties dialog box for a
   user account, and click the Profiles button to add the user profile path. The
   path location should be
   \\<ServerName>\<ShareName>\<Profilename> (where
   <ShareName> is the Profiles directory under <winntroot> and
   <Profilename> is the Windows NT username).

3. In Control Panel, double-click the System icon.

4. On the User Profiles tab, select the existing Local Profile for Profile
   Administrator that you want to copy, and click the Copy To button.

5. In the "Copy profile to" box, specify the universal naming convention (UNC)
   path to the user's profile directory (for example,
   \\<ServerName>\<ShareName>\<UsersProfileDirectory>) or
   select the user's profile directory from within Network Neighborhood. (If the
   user's profile directory does not exist, use the username instead.)

6. Select the user permitted to use this profile. Click OK to copy the profile.
   Click OK to close System Properties.

7. Log on to a computer running Windows NT Workstation 4.0. In Control Panel,
   double-click the System icon. On the User Profiles tab, the logon user
   profile type should show as Roaming.
