======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When using a Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) card that uses Ibmsync.sys on
a multi-drop line, excessive traffic may result in a connection loss. It is
possible that this problem could occur with any SDLC card that uses Ibmsync.sys
(IBM and Microgate dumb cards). This problem is extremely rare as it has only
been observed at one customer site.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Use the 2.1 or 3.0 version of Ibmsync.sys. The problem was only observed in
   SNA Server versions 2.11 and 2.11 sp1.

STATUS
======

Server 2.11 Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA
Server version 2.11 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service
