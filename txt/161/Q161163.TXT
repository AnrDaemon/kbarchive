TITLE   :Third-Party Print Drivers May Not Upgrade with Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a vendor-supplied printer driver installed on a Windows NT 3.51
computer, the printer may disappear or stop functioning after you upgrade to
Windows NT 4.0.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT upgrade does not know how to upgrade vendor-supplied printer
drivers so the printer may not be upgraded or may not operate properly after the
upgrade.

Windows NT 3.51 printer drivers will not work with Windows NT 4.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

Contact your printer vendor about the availability of a Windows NT 4.0 printer
driver or check the Windows NT hardware compatibility list (HCL). If the printer
is listed on the HCL, a driver for the printer will be on the Windows NT 4.0
CD.

After you have located a Windows NT 4.0 printer driver, you can recreate the
printer in Windows NT 4.0.
