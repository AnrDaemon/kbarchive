The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Golf for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you click the New Game button, you receive the following message:

   Microsoft Golf has detected old low-res courses that can be converted for use
   with version 3.0. See the manual for instructions on how to convert old
   courses.

This occurs when you have converted or copied a low-resolution golf course into
the Golf 3.0 folder

RESOLUTION
==========

Convert any low-resolution courses (.crs) you want to use with Microsoft Golf
3.0 to high-resolution courses (.crh).

The following steps describe how to convert a low-resolution golf course using
the Course Converter. To convert the course, do the following:

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Games, and then
   click Course Converter.

2. In the Course Converter dialog box, click the Browse button.

3. From the File Name list, select the file name of the course (the file name
   has a .crs file extension).

4. Click OK.

5. Click the Convert button to start the conversion process. You receive a
   message when the conversion is completed.

   NOTE: Repeat steps 1-5 for each low-resolution golf course you want to
   convert.

6. Click the Close button to close the Course Converter.

7. Restart Golf 3.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Low-resolution courses have a .crs file extension and high-resolution courses
have a .crh file extension. When the course conversion completes, a new file
with a .crh file extension is created in your MSGOLF 3.0 folder. The Course
Converter does not delete the low resolution course that was converted; you can
delete the original course file after you convert the course files.
