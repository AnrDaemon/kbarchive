TITLE   :IBM Client Access/95 Setup Stops Responding
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run IBM Client Access for Windows 95 over the SNA Server 2.11 Service
Pack 1 for Windows 95 client software, the Client Access setup program stops
responding when configuring connections to multiple AS/400's through SNA Server.
After pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL, the following appears in the Close Program dialog
box:

   AS400 Connections - Primary Environment (Not Responding)

Closing this application succeeds.

When you look at the SNA Server Windows 95 client traces, you see that IBM Client
Access 95 uses the APPC DISPLAY function to dynamically retrieve configured APPC
LU's. The first call to DISPLAY succeeds, although the next attempt fails with
STATE_CHECK. The following DISPLAY call stops and never returns.

CAUSE
=====

When the application issues the WinAPPCCleanup() call, the SNA Windows 95 client
"DMOD" removes all of the routing procedures for the application. When the
application issues the WinAPPCStartup() call again, the DISPLAY library does not
register its routing procedure again, and therefore it can never receive any
more messages.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Windows 95 client included
with SNA Server 2.11 Service Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest
SNA Server version 2.11 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
