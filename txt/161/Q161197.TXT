TITLE   :HOWTO: Automate a Word Object Embedded in a Form

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article provides an example of how to programmatically update an OLE object
embedded within a Word document. This example uses both Visual FoxPro 5.0 and
Microsoft Word for Windows 95 version 7.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The sample creates a new form and adds a Word object to that form. Next, the
code activates the Word object to get a reference to its WordBasic object,
deactivates it, and then automates the WordBasic object. The important part of
this code is the temporary activation of Word. The object embedded in a form is
called "Document." Unfortunately, Word does not support the object
"Word.Document" through OLE Automation, but Word does support the object
"WordBasic." The following line of code saves a reference to the object
contained within the Word document:

      oWordRef = oForm.oWordDoc.Object.Application.WordBasic

This allows a programmer to update the object.

Please see the REFERENCES section of this article for additional information.

Code Example
------------

Place the following code in a program file and run it:

      #DEFINE CRLF  CHR(13)+CHR(10)
      PUBLIC oForm
      oForm = CREATE('form')
      oForm.AddObject('oWordDoc','OleControl','WordDocument')
      oForm.oWordDoc.Height =  100
      oForm.oWordDoc.Width =  300
      oForm.oWordDoc.Visible =  .t.
      oForm.Show
      oForm.oWordDoc.DoVerb(0)
      oWordRef = oForm.oWordDoc.Object.Application.WordBasic
      MOUSE CLICK AT 0,0
      oWordRef.Insert("Hello World"+CRLF)
      oWordRef.EditSelectAll
      oWordRef.Font("Arial",18)
      oWordRef.Bold
      oWordRef.EditGoTo("\EndofDoc")
      oWordRef.WordLeft(3)
      oWordRef.SelectCurWord
      oWordRef.CharColor(2)
      RETURN

This code will replace the Visual FoxPro toolbars with the Word toolbars in order
to edit the embedded Word object.
