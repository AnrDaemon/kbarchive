======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

FrontPage 97 has a built-in Internet Database Connector Wizard which, when used
with the Database Results Page template, can create database queries that will
function with the Microsoft Personal Web Server, Microsoft Peer Web Services, or
Microsoft Internet Information Server. This article describes how to get started
using the Internet Database Connector and where to get more information about
it.

NOTE: FrontPage 97 will not record Structured Query Language (SQL) or show you
the table structure of the database you are querying. The Internet Database
Connector Wizard will write the proper file for you, but you will need to know
the SQL and the table structure needed to reach your data.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To start using the Internet Database Connector, use the following steps:

1. Make sure you have all of the following components:
    - Microsoft Personal Web Server, Microsoft Peer Web Services, or Microsoft
      Internet Information Server.

    - An ODBC Driver for your database management system.

    - A database.

2. Create a system data source name using your ODBC Driver. For additional
   information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
