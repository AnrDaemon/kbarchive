======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service Update for Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Routing and Remote Access Service has options for up to 27 different types
of logging or "tracing" that can be enabled through the registry. Output can be
to a file or to the console. The log files will be located in the
<%Systemroot%>\Tracing directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To enable tracing, perform the following steps:

1. Open the registry editor using Regedt32.exe.

2. Go to the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tracing

   The value EnableConsoleTracing (REG_DWORD) either permits or denies console
   tracing for all subkeys. 0 is off and 1 is on.

Console or File Tracing is then individually turned on or off for each of the 27
subkeys. These subkeys under the Tracing key each have a value for
EnableConsoleTracing:REG_DWORD: and EnableFileTracing:REG_DWORD. File tracing
will begin as soon as you edit the EnableFileTracing keys; however, to begin
console tracing you will need to stop and restart the RRAS service.

The Subkeys that may be traced are:

   IPRIP2
   IPRouterManager
   MIB-II Subagent
   MIB-II Utility
   OSPF
   OSPFMIB
   PPP
   RADIUS  (NOTE: This key will only exist if your RRAS Server is
            configured for RADIUS authentication.)
   RASADHLP
   RASAPI32
   RASCHAP
   RASCPL
   RASDLG
   RASIPCP
   RASIPHLP
   RASMAN
   RASMON
   RASSCRIPT
   Router
   IPBOOTP
   IPX Traffic Filter Logging
   IPXCP
   IPXRIP
   IPXRouterManager
   IPXSAP
   IPXWAN
   RASAUTO
   RASNBFCP

The components that are actually traced depend on what protocols and services are
installed on the computer. Double-click the value to bring up the DWORD Editor
so the value can be changed.
