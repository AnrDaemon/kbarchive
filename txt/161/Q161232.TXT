SUMMARY
=======

Beginning with version 5.0, Visual Basic supports Enumerated Types. Enumerations
provide a convenient way to work with sets of related constants and to associate
constant values with identifiers. The identifier may be defined as either a
normal identifier or a more "friendly" identifier that can contain spaces.

NOTE: Other identifiers, such as variable names and procedure names, can not
contain spaces.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Start Microsoft Visual Basic version 5.0. Create a new Standard EXE. Form1 is
   created by default.

2. Add a CommandButton, Command1, to Form 1.

3. Add the following code to Form1:

         Enum Keys1
             TabKey = 12
             EnterKey = 13
             SpaceBar = 32
         End Enum

         Enum Keys2
             [Tab Key] = 12
             [Enter Key] = 13
             [Space Bar] = 32
         End Enum

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
             Dim i As Long
             i = Keys1.EnterKey
             MsgBox i
             i = Keys2.[Space Bar]
             MsgBox i
         End Sub

4. Run the project. Note that the brackets are required or an error will occur.
   Though the brackets will not be displayed when Visual Basic displays a drop
   list of the members of the enumeration. Such as, when you type a period after
   "Keys2", Visual Basic displays a drop list showing the members of the Keys2
   enumeration without the brackets:

   Enter Key
   Space Bar
   Tab Key

   When you select one of the members, Visual Basic fills in the brackets for
   you.

   This code will generate a Compile Error on the second "Test2" line. This is
   due to the compiler expecting an end-of-statement after the word "Space."
