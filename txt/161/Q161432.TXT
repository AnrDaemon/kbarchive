TITLE   :WINS Static Entries Overwritten by Duplicate Group Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You have created a unique static mapping on a Windows Internet Name Service
(WINS) server for a non-WINS-enabled computer. Another WINS-enabled workstation
on the network configures its workgroup name with the same name as the unique
static mapping and reboots. The static computer <00h> entry for the name
is no longer unique, it is now a group name with multiple IP addresses, and
other computers on the network can no longer resolve the original unique name.

CAUSE
=====

The group registration for the duplicate workgroup name overwrote the static
unique entry, creating a group registration with the original IP address and the
new computer's IP address.

STATUS
======
