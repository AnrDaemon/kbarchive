SYMPTOMS
========

Undoing a grouping of the 32nd linked text box to an object causes Word to hang
(stop responding).

WORKAROUND
==========

---------------------

Use the ungroup feature, instead. Right-click the grouped object, point to
Grouping on the shortcut menu, and then click Ungroup.

Do not group an object with the 32nd text box in a sequence. This also includes

to the 32nd text box, the 64th text box, the 96th text box, and so forth in
linked sequences.
