TITLE   :XADM: Setup or Update Fails to Upgrade Admin-Only Computer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You receive the following error when running the update program for Microsoft
Exchange Server 4.0 Service Pack 3 to update a server that is only running the
Microsoft Exchange Server Administration program:

   This version of Exchange Setup can only upgrade servers that are
   4.0a/SP2. Upgrade the server to 4.0a/SP2 and then run Setup again.

CAUSE
=====

The update program is looking for registry entries that do not get installed
when only the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program is installed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you can make a change to the registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows NT. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

      SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Exchange/Setup

3. Add the following value:

      NewestBuild

   Add this value as a REG_DWORD, and enter the Data "3e2" in hexadecimal. The
   full entry in the registry will look like:

      NewestBuild : REG_DWORD : 0x3e2

4. Quit Registry Editor.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K

This problem was also corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The update and setup programs were modified to perform additional checking
(beyond the registry entry) for previous versions of the product. Microsoft
Exchange Server 4.0 Service Pack 4 and Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 setup will
perform the additional checking, as will all future versions.
