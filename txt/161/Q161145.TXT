TITLE   :BUG: Group Header on Report with Columns Prints on Detail Band
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbvfp kbvfp300BUG kbvfp500bug kbvfp600bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a grouped report is designed with multiple columns, where the data from
each record occupies a column, and records spread from the left-most column to
the right and wrap around to the next row after the right-most column is used,
the group header data prints as the first entry in the left- most column for
each group.

This is different from the report behavior for previous versions of FoxPro. In
prior versions the group header information appears on the line above the first
entry in the detail band for each group.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open the OrdItems table from Samples\data.

2. Create a new report by clicking New on the File menu and choosing Report.

3. Build a Quick Report by selecting Quick Report from the Report menu. Specify
   "Fields" by checking the appropriate box. Select the Order_ID and Line_No
   fields, click OK and OK.

4. Select Page Layout from the File menu. Make the column count = 3, and click
   the large button (on the right) that pictures printing from left to right so
   that a line contains detail items arranged from column 1 to column 2 to
   column 3, and so forth.

5. Select Data Grouping from the Report menu pad, and specify grouping on
   Order_ID.

6. Pull down the "Group Header" bar just far enough to allow you to drag the
   Order_ID field from the detail band to the group header band. Drag the
   Order_ID field accordingly.

7. Drag the line_no field left to the edge of the detail band.

8. (Optional) make the font for the Order_ID field BOLD and ITALIC so that you
   can distinguish it from the Line_no field in the report preview.

9. Preview the report. Note that the group header information prints on the same
   line as the detail information.
