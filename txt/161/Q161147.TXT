======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS

When a Microsoft Visual FoxPro 5.0 form contains ToolTips and a timer control,
any ToolTip that is currently displayed disappears when the timer control fires
a timer event.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Use the following steps in Visual FoxPro 5.0. You can also do the process in
Visual FoxPro 3.0b in order to appreciate the changed behavior in Visual FoxPro
5.0.

1. Create a form in the visual desktop using the Form Designer. On the form
   place the following controls:

   a. a label
      name = 'Label1'
      caption = any text

   b. a textbox
      name = 'Textbox1'
      controlsource = thisform.mytext
      ToolTipText = any wording for that property's caption

   c. a timer control
      Interval = 1000
      Timer-event method containing the following:

              ThisForm.Label1.Caption = TIME()

   d. a command button
      Click method that issues the command

              ThisForm.Release

2. Add a custom property named "MyText" (without the quotation marks) to the
   form.

3. Set the ShowTips property of the form to True (.T.).

4. Run the form. Position the cursor over textbox1. Observe the ToolTip.

5. In the Visual FoxPro 5.0 form, change the interval of the timer to 5000.

6. Run the form again. Position the cursor over textbox1. When the ToolTip is
   cleared move the mouse very slightly.

The ToolTip on the Visual FoxPro 3.0b form persists as long as the cursor is over
textbox1. The ToolTip on the Visual FoxPro 5.0 form clears when the timer fires.
With the 1000ms interval it can never be restored. With the 5000ms interval
moving the cursor with the slightest MouseMove event restores the ToolTip.
