DOCUMENT:Q161960  10-AUG-2001  [winnt]
TITLE   :STOP 0x0000007B On Windows NT 4.0 After SP2 Applied
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP2 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 on a computer with IDE hard disks,
you may receive the following blue-screen STOP message when you restart your
computer:

   STOP 0x0000007B
   Inaccessible_Boot_Device

CAUSE
=====

The updated version of Atapi.sys included with Service Pack 2 causes this STOP
message to occur. This error should only occur if the boot or system partitions
(startup file or operating system files) reside on an IDE drive. Windows NT
operating system files installed on a SCSI hard disk do not experience this
problem.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, do one of the following:

 - If Windows NT is installed on a FAT partition, replace Atapi.sys in the
   %SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers folder with the Atapi.sys file in the I386
   folder of the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM.

   -or-

 - Start your computer with the Emergency Repair Disk (ERD) created prior to the
   application of Service Pack 2, select Verify Windows NT System Files only,
   and then repair the Atapi.sys file.

   NOTE: If the computer was using Atdisk.sys instead of Atapi.sys, replace both
   Atapi.sys and Atdisk.sys.

   For more information on the Emergency Repair process, please see the following
   article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   ARTICLE-ID: Q129037
   TITLE : Windows NT 3.5x and 4.0 Emergency Repair Process Screens

   -or-

 - If Windows NT is installed on an NTFS partition, re-install Windows NT to a
   separate folder. Log on to this parallel installation and replace Atapi.sys
   in the %SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers folder of the original Windows NT
   installation with the Atapi.sys file in the I386 folder of the Windows NT 4.0
   CD-ROM.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
