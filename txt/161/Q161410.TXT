SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to set up a private network connection over the
Internet using the Point-to-Point Tunneling protocol (PPTP).

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can establish secure, multiple-protocol Virtual Private Network (VPN)
connections over public data networks such as the Internet using PPTP. By
dialing into your Internet service provider's point of presence (POP), you can
access your corporate networks and programs without dialing directly into the
company's network. PPTP connects directly to the target server by creating a
virtual network for each remote client. A Windows NT 4.0 Server administrator
can monitor and manage such a virtual network just like any other remote access
port.

To use PPTP to connect to a server securely across the Internet, you must first
install the PPTP protocol. To do so, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Network, and then click the Protocols tab.

2. Add Point To Point Tunneling Protocol.

3. After the protocol is loaded, Remote Access Services Setup is invoked. You
   must add at least one VPN port as a port in RAS Setup. You may need to
   configure the newly created VPN adapter to "Dial out and receive calls." The
   default setting is "Receive calls only."

4. Specify the protocols to run for the VPN port. You can install up to 256 VPN
   ports. Each VPN can be connected to a network.

5. If you have Service Pack 3 or later installed, reapply the service pack, and
   then restart the computer.

To make a PPTP connection to a target server over the Internet, follow these
steps:

1. In Dial-Up Networking, make a new phone book entry for the target server. For
   the phone number, specify the IP address or host name of the server. Make
   sure to specify the VPN port you want to use.

   NOTE: After you have a phone book entry set up, you can check and modify phone
   book settings by clicking More, and then clicking Edit Entry And Modem
   Properties. In the Phone Book Entry dialog box, verify that the Dial Using
   box specifies a VPN port. Click the Server tab, and verify that a protocol
   that the target server uses is selected. You can specify the security you
   want on the Security tab.

2. Dial your ISP and make your connection to the Internet.

3. When you are connected to your ISP, dial the target server to establish the
   PPTP connection.
