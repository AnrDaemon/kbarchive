SUMMARY

This article explains how to enable SMB signing.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 provides an updated version of the Server Message
Block (SMB) authentication protocol, also known as the Common Internet File
System (CIFS) file sharing protocol. For more information on SMB signing, please
see the Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 Readme.txt file.

Perform the following steps to configure SMB signing on a server:

WARNING: Using the registry editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of the registry editor can be
solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

   System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanManServer\Parameters

3. Click Add Value on the Edit menu.

4. Add the following two values:

      Value Name: EnableSecuritySignature
      Data Type: REG_DWORD
      Data: 0 (disable), 1 (enable)

         NOTE: The default is 0 (disable)

      Name: RequireSecuritySignature
      Type: REG_DWORD
      Value: 0 (disable), 1 (enable)

         NOTE: The default is 0 (disable)

5. Click OK and then quit Registry Editor.

6. Shut down and restart Windows NT.

Perform the following steps to configure SMB signing on a workstation:

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

   \System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Rdr\Parameters

3. Click Add Value on the Edit menu.

4. Add the following two values:

      Value Name: EnableSecuritySignature
      Data Type: REG_DWORD
      Data: 0 (disable), 1 (enable)

         NOTE: The default is 1 (enable)

      Name: RequireSecuritySignature
      Type: REG_DWORD
      Value: 0 (disable), 1 (enable)

         NOTE: The default is 0 (disable)

5. Click OK and then quit Registry Editor.

6. Shut down and restart Windows NT.

Using SMB signing will slow down the performance when enabled. This setting is
only to be used when network security is a concern. Performance decrease usually
averages between 10 to 15%. The very nature of SMB signing requires that every
packet is signed for and every packet must be verified.
