TITLE   :Windows 95 Clients Connected to NT Server over NWLink May Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.11 3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Applications on Windows 95 or Windows for Workgroups 3.11 may fail while writing
data to a computer running Microsoft Windows NT server over the NWLink protocol.
The problem occurs only when direct hosting over NWLink is used. Direct hosting
is a method of bypassing the NetBIOS layer and sending client/server message
blocks (SMBs) directly over the NWLink protocol.

When the problem occurs, the application on the client computer may display the
following message:

   Error 55: The specified network resource or device is no longer available.



WORKAROUND
==========

The workaround involves disabling direct hosting. To turn off direct hosting,
disable the NWLink IPX/SPX binding in Windows NT Server service. After this is
done, enable NWLink with NetBIOS on the client computer.

For more information, query on the following words here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   direct and hosting

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5x and 4.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
