TITLE   :Application Exception in SETUP.EXE if CleanSweep 3.0 Installed
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.1,2.11,2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Running SNA Server Setup results in a Dr. Watson error if CleanSweep 3.0 is
installed on the Windows NT Server. The DRWTSN32.LOG will contain information
similar to the following:

   Application exception occurred:
   App: exe\setup.dbg (pid=73)
   When: 12/13/1996 @ 15:47:40.208
   Exception number: c0000005 (access violation)

This problem occurs on both Windows NT Server 3.51 and 4.0.

CAUSE
=====

The application exception in SNA Server's Setup program occurs if Quarterdeck's
CleanSweep Version 3.0 is installed on the Windows NT Server where SNA Server is
being installed.

Installing CleanSweep V3.0 after SNA Server is installed results in the same
problem if SNA Server Setup is executed to reconfigure or remove SNA Server.

RESOLUTION
==========

The current solution is to remove CleanSweep V3.0 from Windows NT servers that
will be running SNA Server version 2.1, 2.11, or 2.11 SP1. The problem does not
occur with SNA Server 3.0.
