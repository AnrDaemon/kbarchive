TITLE   :FIX: MODIFY MEMO Command Ignores IN WINDOW Clause
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbvfp kbvfp500aFIX kbvfp500bugkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Visual FoxPro 5.0 ignores the IN WINDOW clause of the MODIFY MEMO command. The
memo's window appears outside the parent window. Visual FoxPro 3.0b and FoxPro
2.x respect this clause. In those versions, the memo window appears within the
parent window.

RESOLUTION
==========

The MODIFY FILE... IN WINDOW command functions properly. Use the COPY MEMO
command to place the contents of the memo field into a text file. Then display
the text file with the MODIFY FILE command.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro
5.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following program illiterates this behavior.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a program containing the following code:

      IF 'Visual'$VERS()
         USE HOME() + 'samples\data\employee'
      ELSE
         USE HOME() + 'tutorial\salesman'
      ENDIF
      DEFINE WINDOW Test FROM 1,1 TO 25, 70 ;
       SYSTEM FLOAT GROW CLOSE Title "Test"
      ACTIVATE WINDOW Test
      MODIFY MEMO notes IN WINDOW Test
      USE

2. Run the program. Notice the window containing the memo appears outside the
   window called Test.
