KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist kbfixlist

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to log on to a File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) server
running on Windows NT 4.0 in a Token Ring environment where the client is
separated from the server by multiple source routing bridges, the following
error is returned:

   Shell-332-76: Network Error on Server "servername":
   Error Receiving from Network;
   Abort, Retry, ?

The above error is what you would get on a Novell-only client. A VLM client gives
a similar error.

CAUSE
=====

Not enough buffer space is allocated to accommodate the Routing Information
Field on the FPNW server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
