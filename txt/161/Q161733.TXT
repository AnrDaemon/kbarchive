TITLE   :Err Msg: Unable to Locate NWAPI32.DLL with IntranetWare Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbnetwork kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the IntranetWare Client for Windows NT manufactured by Novell is installed on
a computer running Windows NT Workstation 3.51 or 4.0, it replaces the Client
Services for NetWare (CSNW) service. After installation, if Last Known Good
Configuration is selected during the startup process, it will fail with the
following error message:

   Services.exe - unable to find or locate NWAPI32.DLL

CAUSE
=====

When the Novell IntranetWare Client for Windows NT is installed, it asks if you
want to replace the Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) service. If you select
Yes, the IntranetWare client installation process removes CSNW and, in addition
to making changes in the registry, deletes the following two files:

   Nwapi32.dll
   Nwc.cpl

This is by design. Novell's IntranetWare Client for Windows NT is manufactured by
Novell, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or
otherwise, regarding this product's performance or reliability.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the above two files are reinstalled, the Last Known Good Configuration will
function normally.
