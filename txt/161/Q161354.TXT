BUG #: 4469 (odbc30)

SYMPTOMS
========

SQLGetInfo may return the incorrect result for the SQL_DRIVER_HSTMT option if
both of the following conditions are true:

 - The ODBC application is a 16-bit application.

   -and-

 - The ODBC driver is 32-bit, and was compiled under the ODBC 2.5 SDK.

The 16-bit ODBC application will encounter this problem only when using the ODBC
SDK 3.0 thunking layer.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the thunking layer that came with the ODBC 2.5
SDK. The following files need to be replaced:

   Ds16gt.dll
   Ds32gt.dll
   Odbc16gt.dll
   Odbc32gt.dll

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Open Database Connectivity
version 3.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
