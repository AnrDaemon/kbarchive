TITLE   :Service Pack 2 May Cause Loss of Connectivity in Remote Access
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenvkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP2 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Service Pack 2 for Windows NT 4.0, you may not be able to ping
or otherwise make use of the connection you have established with an ISP when
using RAS to dial out.

Additionally, the route table may not have a route for the remote connection.

CAUSE
=====

The Multilinking Protocol (MP) option is always negotiated during the Link
Control Protocol (LCP)-phase of negotiation in Service Pack 2 for Windows NT
4.0. This occurs if the Enable PPP LCP Extensions check box on the Server tab of
the Edit Phonebook Entry dialog box is enabled or disabled.

Although MP is an extension of LCP, it is not part of RFC 1570 -- LCP Extensions.
In Service Pack 2 for Windows NT 4.0, it is no longer necessary to enable this
check box to attempt MP negotiation.

NOTE: Some Internet service providers (ISP) cannot deal with the MP options
correctly. This problem is resolved by changing the conditions in which RAS
sends multilink information to the remote server.

RESOLUTION
==========

The binaries below resolve this issue by making an attempt at MP negotiation
only if there is more than one link in the phonebook entry.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT version
4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
