SUMMARY
=======

The Assert method of the Debug object allows monitoring of an expression for
failure conditions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following syntax is used for the Assert method:

   Debug.Assert (expression)

The Assert method syntax has the following object qualifier and part:

      Part            Description
      ----            -----------
      Debug           Required. The Assert method only applies to the
                      Debug object.

      expression      Required. Any logical expression.

The Assert method forces a design-time break at the Assert statement when the
expression evaluates to False. If the expression evaluates as True, program
operation continues. For example:

         Function myFunction (x as Long,y as Long, z as Long) as Long
             Debug.Assert (x<>0 And y<>0 And z<>0)
             myFunction = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z
         End Function

If you call myFunction as:

         q = myFunction (1,2,3)

the program continues as normal. However, passing a zero as any one of the
parameters forces a break. The following example breaks at the Assert
statement:

         q = myFunction (1,0,3)

The above example allows testing for inappropriate parameters to protect against
a division by zero error. If a break occurs at the Assert statement, you can
check the locals window to determine which value is inappropriate. This is
especially useful when the argument values come from other functions:

        q = myFunction ( calcX(), calcY(), calcZ() )

The Assert method is only used for debugging. During compiling, Microsoft Visual
Basic always removes Assert statements from the final code. There is no
workaround for this behavior.
