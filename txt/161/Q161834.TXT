In Visual FoxPro 3.0b for Windows running on Windows 95, the program shuts down
after displaying the following error:

   This program performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.

After pressing the Details button, the following error appears:

   VFP caused an invalid page fault in module Kernel32.dll at <register
   address>.
