OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbinterop kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Newprof.exe to create multiple profiles on a single computer
running Windows 3.x, the computer generates a general protection fault (GPF) in
Mapi.dll after approximately 10 profiles have been created. This problem only
happens if Word for Windows 6.x is running at the same time Newprof.exe is
running.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange client
version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: WIN16 UAE unrecoverable application error
