======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Starting SNA Server Admin results in an Event ID 633 error stating:

   The sharename COMCFG does not exist, or the SNA Server configuration file
   com.cfg does not exist.

CAUSE
=====

This error may be the result of setting the NTFS permissions on Com.cfg to Admin
Full Control only and on the directory CONFIG to Admin Full Control only. These
permissions may have worked with Windows NT 3.51, but will fail under Windows NT
4.0. This problem may also occur with SNA Server versions 3.0 and 4.0 if the
services are configured to run under the local system account.

RESOLUTION
==========

Adding the group Everyone with Read access to the permissions will eliminate the
error. The Com.cfg is located in <snaroot>\system\config directory. In
addition, the COMCFG share also requires that the group Everyone have Read
Access. To eliminate the need for Everyone:Read access, please refer to the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
