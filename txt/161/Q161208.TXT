The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can create a default property for your User Control. A default property is
the property selected when you select the control in design mode. For example,
when you select a Label, the highlighted property is Caption. Therefore, Caption
is the default property for the Label. This article will explain how to create a
default property for a User Control that you create.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create a default property, first you must create the property by doing the
following:

1. Start a new ActiveX Control project in Visual Basic.

2. From the View menu, select Code to open the control's code window.

3. From the Tools menu, select Add Procedure.

4. In the Add Procedure dialog box, enter the property name, and check the
   Property option in the Type frame.

5. Click OK.

After the property is created, follow these steps to make the property the
default property:

1. From the Tools menu, select Procedure Attributes.

2. In the Procedure Attributes dialog box, select the property name you
   previously created.

3. Add a Description, if desired, and select Advanced>>.

4. Select the User Interface Default check box in the Attributes frame.

5. Click OK.

When using the User Control in designing a Visual Basic form, the default
property will be highlighted when the User Control is selected.

You can only have one default property for each control. Therefore, you can only
select the "User Interface Default" checkbox for one property. If you select
this checkbox for another property, it will ask you if you want to make the
newly-selected property the default property.
