TITLE   :WD97: Full Screen View Toolbar Is Hidden
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbualink97 kbdta kbdtacode kbmacroexample word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you view Full Screen (on the View menu, click Full Screen), the Full Screen
toolbar is missing.

CAUSE
=====

By design, Word does not provide a menu command to turn off the Full Screen
toolbar. The only way to hide the Full Screen toolbar is to run a Visual Basic
for Applications command.

If the Full Screen toolbar is hidden, you may have a macro or add-in that has set
the visible property for the Full Screen toolbar to False.
