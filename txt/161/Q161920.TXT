TITLE   :SMS: Program Group Control Fails to Set Up Localized Office 95
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPGC smspgckbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A localized version of Microsoft Office 95 fails to install with Systems
Management Server Program Group Control (PGC). The shared installation screen
appears for about two seconds, then fails with an error stating that the
application has not been correctly configured.

CAUSE
=====

The Systems Management Server utility that processes Microsoft Office 95 Setup
runs Setup.exe for its command line. U.S. and German versions work correctly,
but other localized versions fail because different command lines are used, such
as Install.exe (Norwegian use), or Asenna.exe (Finnish).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server version 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
