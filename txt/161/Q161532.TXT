TITLE   :PPT7: Importing Freelance 96 Presentations into PowerPoint
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbdta kbconversion

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95 version 7.0 does not include a converter for
Lotus Freelance Graphics 96 for Windows 95 or Lotus Freelance 2.x for Windows
files.

If you try to import a Freelance 96 presentation (.prz) file into PowerPoint, you
receive one of the following messages:

   PowerPoint cannot open the type of file represented by <filename>.prz.

   -or-

   <path>\<filename>.prz. Sorry, this type of file cannot be opened
   by PowerPoint.

If you save a Freelance Graphics 96 file as a Freelance Graphics 2.x for Windows
(.pre) file and try to import it into PowerPoint, you receive only a single
slide from the presentation.

Although Lotus Development Corporation advertises that you can save Freelance 96
presentation files in Freelance 2.x for Windows format, Microsoft has not tested
this feature and does not guarantee its performance.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To open a Freelance 96 file in PowerPoint, create a separate file for each
slide, save each file in Freelance 2.x format, and then open the files in
