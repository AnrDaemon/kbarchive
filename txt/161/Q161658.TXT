The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

When you attempt to open a form in the Microsoft Exchange client that has been
extended in 16-bit Visual Basic 4.0 to access an external Microsoft Access
database, you receive the following error:

   Runtime error - object error 424

NOTE: This error does not occur on the computer used to design the form.

This problem is resolved if you install the Microsoft Exchange Server Forms
Designer or Visual Basic on that client computer. This is because the DLLs
required for accessing the Microsoft Access database need to be copied and
registered to work correctly. Merely specifying the copied DLL in the form's
.cfg file does not register the DLL correctly. The process of installing the
Microsoft Exchange Server Forms Designer or Visual Basic does this during the
Setup process.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Dao2516.dll file cannot be copied over to the computer and be registered
correctly. To correctly register it, you must do the following:

1. Have all the necessary DLLs copied over to the computer, by using the .cfg
   file.

2. Copy over the Regsvr.exe file, or run it with the following command-line
   switch:

   REGSVR DAO2516.DLL

This command registers the DLL correctly; after doing this the form will not give
the runtime error.
NOTE: To correctly register the Dao2516.dll file you must also have all of its
supporting files on the client computer. The following files also needed for the
registration process to work correctly:

   Vaen21.olb
   Msajt200.dll
   Msjeterr.dll
   Msjetint.dll
   Vbajet.dll
   Vbdb16.dll

You must decide when and how to run Regsvr.exe to register the DLL. Running
Regsvr.exe is the only way to register the DLL short of installing an
application that runs the Setup Wizard, and in turn registers Dao2516.dll.
