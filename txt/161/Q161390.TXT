         Dim WhatIsSelected As Long

         ' Obtain the PpSelectionType constant.
         WhatIsSelected = ActiveWindow.Selection.Type

         ' Display a message box indicating the current selection type.
         Select Case WhatIsSelected
            Case ppSelectionNone
               MsgBox "Nothing is selected."
            Case ppSelectionSlides
               MsgBox "A slide is selected."
            Case ppSelectionShapes
               MsgBox "A shape is selected."
            Case ppSelectionText
               MsgBox "Text or a Text Box is selected."
