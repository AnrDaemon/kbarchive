PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Some of the fonts that appeared at the top of the Font list (on the Formatting
toolbar) fail to reappear when you restart Word.

NOTE: In earlier versions of Word, the list of fonts at the top of the Font list
[called the "Most Recently Used" (MRU) Font list] includes the last six fonts
you used. This list is retained when you exit Word. The MRU Font list is
comprised of any font used in a document--including TrueType fonts, screen
fonts, and printer fonts.

CAUSE
=====

When you restart Word, only the fonts that are used in the predefined styles for
Word are listed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Word 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Word uses the following fonts for its default styles, and, as a
result, only these fonts are retained at the top of the Font list:

   Arial
   Courier New
   Tahoma
   Times New Roman

Additional query words: built-in built in
