The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Creative Writer 2 for Windows 95 can open pictures in the following graphic
formats:

Format               File Extension
------               --------------
Bitmap               .BMP
CompuServe Graphics  .GIF
JPEG Picture Format  .JPG
PC Paintbrush        .PCX
Windows Metafile     .WMF

Creative Writer 2 can save pictures you create in its PaintIt! program as bitmap
(.BMP) files.

INSTRUCTIONS
------------

To open an existing picture file, do the following:

1. In Creative Writer 2, click Picture Picker on the Picture menu and then click
   a picture.

2. Click the Open button in the lower-left corner of the Picture Picker dialog
   box.

3. Change to the drive or folder that contains your picture file, click on the
   file and then click OK. Your picture will now be imported into the Picture
   Picker under the My Clipart category.

4. Click your picture in the preview window of the Picture Picker and then click
   OK.

To save a picture you created in PaintIt! in bitmap (.BMP) format, do the
following:

1. In the PaintIt! program, click Save Copy As on the File menu.

2. Name the file, and select a location for saving it.

3. Click Save.

After following these steps, the file is in a format that is readable by many
other graphics applications. You cannot save a whole Creative Writer 2 document
as a graphic file. Only a picture you create or edit in the PaintIt! program can
be saved as a bitmap (.BMP) file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Adding graphics filters for importing different image formats (for example,
TIFF) to your computer may enable Creative Writer to import the corresponding
graphics types in addition to the ones that are enabled by the filters that are
installed by Creative Writer.
