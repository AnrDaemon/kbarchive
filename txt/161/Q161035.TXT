TITLE   :GetAddressByName API Causes SAP Broadcast
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the GetAddressByName API in a sockets application to resolve the
name of a service in an IPX network, a SAP broadcast storm may occur.

CAUSE
=====

By default under Windows NT, the GetAddressByName API will contact the NetWare
preferred server bindery to resolve the name of the service. If the bindery
search for the desired object fails, a SAP broadcast occurs on the net for the
desired object. This SAP broadcast can cause a SAP broadcast storm.


RESOLUTION
==========

Use the Updated files.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.51 and
4.0.

A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
