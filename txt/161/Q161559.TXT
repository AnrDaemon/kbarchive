TITLE   :Executing Perl Scripts Generates 403 Access Forbidden Error
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::2.0,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Perl, the following error message may appear when you execute
a Perl script from the Scripts virtual directory:

   HTTP/1.0 403 Access Forbidden (Read Access Denied - This Virtual
   Directory does not allow objects to be read.)

CAUSE
=====

During the installation of Perl, a registry entry is added to the following
subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3Svc\Parameters
   \Script Map\.pl : Reg_Sz : Path:\PerlIS.Dll

This registry entry specifies that a file with the extension .pl can be executed
in a virtual directory and calls the PerlIs.dll interpreter.

WORKAROUND
==========

All Internet Services must be stopped and then restarted after installing Perl
for Windows NT. The registry change will not take effect until the services have
been restarted.
