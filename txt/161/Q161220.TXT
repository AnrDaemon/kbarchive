TITLE   :Removing Unknown Device in Device Manager Hangs Computer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::2,2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:osr2 win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Removing an unknown device from Device Manager may cause the computer to stop
responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

The computer's BIOS does not respond correctly to the device removal, causing
the computer to hang.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:

 - Contact your computer manufacturer about a possible BIOS upgrade.

 - If your computer has a USB hub, contact your computer manufacturer to obtain
   the Windows 95 OEM Service Release version 2.1 update.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is not unique to any one device or BIOS. When you remove a device
from Device Manager, a device removal notification is issued to the BIOS. The
BIOS is then responsible for handling this message and acting accordingly
(typically doing nothing). However, in certain systems, the BIOS is left in an
unknown state and eventually hangs the computer.
