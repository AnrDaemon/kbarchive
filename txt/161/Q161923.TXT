SUMMARY
=======

This article offers suggestions for using variables and data types in Microsoft
Visual Basic for Applications in the applications listed at the beginning of
this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

When declaring variables, the default data type is Variant. Programmers should
ideally specify specific data types and not use the Variant data types. Variant
data types consume more memory, do not offer the same performance as specific
data types, and can promote errors in programming logic.

Make sure variables are properly declared. Consider the following example:

      Dim oVar1, oVar2 As Object

This syntax may appear to be declaring two Object variables, but in this case
oVar1 is being implicitly declared as a Variant (the default data type) and
oVar2 is being explicitly declared as an Object. The following code will produce
two Object variables:

      Dim oVar1 As Object
      Dim oVar2 As Object

-or-

      Dim oVar1 As Object, oVar2 As Object

For more information about dimensioning variables, from the Visual Basic Editor,
click the Office Assistant, type "Declaring Variables" (without the quotation
marks), click Search, and then click to view "Declaring Variables."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If the Assistant is not able to answer your query, please see
