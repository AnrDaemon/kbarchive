TITLE   :PRB:Cannot Open File AppleGuideGlueLib When Trying to Quit VFP
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message appears when you try to quit Visual FoxPro. Or if
you are in a Visual FoxPro executable, this error message appears over and over
when you try to quit the executable. In both cases, you cannot quit the
program:

   Cannot open file AppleGuideGlueLib.

CAUSE
=====

Help has been set to an Apple Guide Help file, and the Apple Guide extension is
not loaded.

RESOLUTION
==========

Type the SET HELP TO command in the Command window so that Help is not set to
anything. If you are using Apple Guide Help in an executable, type the SET HELP
TO command immediately after the CLEAR EVENTS command.

Also, make sure that the Apple Guide extension is loaded. Visual FoxPro does not
install the Apple Guide extension. It is provided with the Macintosh System
software.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
