TITLE   :XCLN: Electronic Forms Support
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, the following error message
appears:

   Correctly displaying this item requires a custom form that is either not
   available or not correctly installed. Please see your network administrator
   for more information.

On the Compose menu, there is no New Form option.

CAUSE
=====

Forms support for the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client is limited. There is
no MAPI or Visual Basic support for the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client.
Forms support is limited to reading a text version of the form.

The Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client cannot access forms directly through the
Compose menu. This is by product design. With the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh
client, you will only be able to read a "textized" form.

WORKAROUND
==========

In order for the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client to see a text version of
the form, the form needs to be configured for that option when you create it. To
do this:

1. In the Electronic Forms Designer, click Window Properties.

2. On the Menus tab, click Submit Options and click the "Show fields as text in
   the message body" check box.

Controls added by extending a form using Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 16-bit cannot
be "textized" without additional code. For more information on extending
Microsoft Exchange Forms, please see the Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer
Guide.
