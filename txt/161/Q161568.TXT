   TITLE : OFF97: Page Fault After Using Desktop Themes Control Panel.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Office 97 replaces a file named Jpegim32.flt in the
%SystemDrive%\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Grphflt folder with a
version that is incompatible with desktop themes.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform one of the following two steps:

1. Rename the file Jpegim32.flt to Jpegim32.flt_bak in the %SystemDrive%\Program
   Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Grphflt folder. Copy the Jpegim32.flt
   file included with either Office 95 or Windows 95 to the same folder.

   - or -

2. Rename the file Jpegim32.flt to Jpegim32.flt_bak in the %SystemDrive%\Program
   Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Grphflt folder and do not replace it.

   Note that Windows NT 4.0 may have the same-named file in the
   %SystemRoot%\System32 folder; this file does not need to be renamed.

NOTE: The first method will display the window with the percentage bar showing
the decompression. The second will not.

Once the new desktop theme has been installed, the Jpegim32.flt_bak file should
be renamed back to Jpegim32.flt. This will ensure compatibility with Microsoft
Office 97.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server and
Workstation version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
