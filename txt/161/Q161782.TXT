-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Systems Management Server Remote Agent, a blue screen with
a stop error code of 0xC000021a (or E11E1968, C0000005, 77FA4395, or 0021F10C)
occurs on a computer running Windows NT Server 3.5x or Windows NT Workstation
3.5x at startup. The service does not need to be started for the error to
occur.


CAUSE
=====

This error may occur if there is a conflict with the video card or chipset and
the Systems Management Server Accelerated Screen Transfer (Idisnt.dll). When
remotely controlling client computers running Windows NT Server or Windows NT
Workstation version 3.51, you can increase the performance of the display in the
Quick Windows Viewer by setting this client option in the Site Properties dialog
box. When this option is enabled, data sent from the client to the viewer
contains only those lines of pixels that have changed (rather than all pixels),
and the data is compressed.

WORKAROUND
==========

Remove the affected video card driver from the "Accelerate with These Video
Drivers" list in the Remote Troubleshooting Options (found in Clients under Site
Properties).

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine the display driver the client is using, open the Display Control
Panel, click Change Display Type, and look at the driver listed under Driver
Information.

For more information on how the Systems Management Server Accelerated Screen
Transfer works, please refer to the Systems Management Server 1.2 documentation.
