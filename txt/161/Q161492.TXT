The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

SNA Server 2.11 and later versions support the VTAM V4 feature referred to as
"Dynamically Defined Dependent LUs" (DDDLU). The host support of DDDLU is
indicated in the ACTPU sent to SNA Server. Upon receiving a request for a 3270
session, SNA Server will request that the host activate a LU for this session.
The Host PU definition defines support for DDDLU by the use of the LUGROUP and
LUSEED parameters, there will be no LUs defined in the PU definition. The SNA
Server configuration, though, must have the LUs defined, although they will be
displayed as inactive until a client requests a session.

NOTE: For information about DDDLU support in VTAM, please refer to the following
reference:

   VTAM Network Implementation Guide, V4R1 for MVS/ESA, IBM document number
   SC31-6419-00

For information about the format of these messages, please refer to the following

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Host indicates support of DDDLU in the PU Capabilities (x'80') ACTPU Control
Vector (byte 9 in the ACTPU ru) by setting the first bit of the third byte of to
1.

   Bit  1-7  Reserved

When using DDDLU, SNA Server will only receive an ACTPU from the Host. No ACTLUs
will flow until a session is requested (unless the PU definition has static LUs
defined in addition to the dynamic). When SNA Server receives an OpenSSCP
request for a 3270 display session, it will send a NMVT request to the Host.
This NMVT request will cause an ACTLU to be sent to the SNA Server, allowing it
to satisfy the request for a session.
