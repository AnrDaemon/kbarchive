SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Visual Basic, Event Logging allows an application to add
information to either a user-defined file or the Microsoft Windows NT or Windows
2000 Event Log when a user-defined criteria is met.

This functionality is only available when running a compiled application. If you
attempt to use the logging methods while in the Microsoft Visual Basic
development environment, the logging methods will be ignored.

MORE INFORMATION
================



The logging can be enabled for the development process by creating and compiling
a user-defined ActiveX DLL or EXE component that exposes the logging methods of
the App object. The application in the development environment need only to add
a reference to this compiled component. Calling the exposed methods of this
ActiveX component will allow logging to function. Below is a sample ActiveX DLL
that exposes the StartLogging and LogEvent methods of the App object.

WARNING: ANY USE BY YOU OF THE CODE PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
Microsoft provides this code "as is" without warranty of any kind, either
express or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of
merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose.

1. Start Microsoft Visual Basic. Open a new ActiveX DLL project. This will add
   Class1 to the new project.

2. Change the Name property of Class1 to "Logging" (without quotes).

3. From the Project menu, click Project1 Properties.

4. Change the Name of the Project to "AppMessages" (without quotes).

5. Add the following code to the Logging class:

         Public Enum eLogModes
             mLogAuto = 0
             mLogOff = 1
             mLogToFile = 2
             mLogToNT = 3
             mLogOverwrite = &H10
             mLogThreadID = &H20
         End Enum

         Public Sub StartLog(logTarget As String, logMode As eLogModes)
             App.StartLogging logTarget, logMode

         End Sub

         Public Sub AddLogEvent(LogBuffer As String, EventType As _
         LogEventTypeConstants)
             App.LogEvent LogBuffer, EventType
         End Sub

NOTE: Other methods may be exposed to apply to your specific needs. See the
Microsoft Visual Basic Online Help for the entire list of event log methods of
the App object.

1. From the File menu, click Make AppMessage.DLL. Select a folder in which to
   place the DLL, and click OK.

2. From the File menu, click New project. Click Yes to Save the AppMessage
   source code for later use.

3. Select Standard EXE. Click OK.

4. From the Project menu, click References.

5. Turn on the reference to "AppMessages." Click OK.

6. To Form1, add the following code:

          Private Sub Form_Load()
              Dim t As New AppMessages.Logging
              t.StartLog "C:\TEMP\Test.log", mLogToFile
              t.AddLogEvent "Form Loaded", vbLogEventTypeInformation
              Set t = Nothing
          End Sub

7. From the Run menu, click Start. A new file "Test.log" will be created and
   placed into the C:\TEMP folder. This file will contain the information:

   "Information Application C:\TEMP\Test.log: Thread ID: -316429 ,Logged: Form
   Loaded"
