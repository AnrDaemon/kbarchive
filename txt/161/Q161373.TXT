TITLE   :Background Color Changes When Exiting MS-DOS Prompt
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you exit from a full-screen MS-DOS prompt, the background color on your
desktop computer changes.

CAUSE
=====

This problem has been known to occur when the following three conditions hold
true simultaneously:

1. The computer's video card uses a Cirrus Logic chip set.

2. The MS-DOS prompt has been configured to open to full screen as the default.

3. The Cirrus Logic video driver included on the Windows NT 4.0 compact disc is
   being used.

RESOLUTION
==========

Contact Cirrus Logic Technical Support for information concerning availability
of an updated video driver.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To restore the previous desktop color, open the MS-DOS prompt full screen and
press ALT-ENTER to switch the MS-DOS prompt to a window. The desktop color is
restored. Exit the MS-DOS prompt from the window. Go to Control Panel, MS-DOS
Console, and change the display options to "Window."

As stated, this problem will only occur if the video card uses a Cirrus Logic
chip set AND the MS-DOS prompt has been configured to open as full screen. If an
MS-DOS prompt is opened as a window first and then switched to full screen,
exiting from the full-screen DOS prompt will not cause this problem.
