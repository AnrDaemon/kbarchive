TITLE   :TP_START Stops Responding If SnaBase Fails on Win95 Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11,2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A 5250/APPC application appears to stop responding indefinitely on a SNA Server
client computer running Windows 95.

CAUSE
=====

If SnaBase successfully connects to a computer running SNA Server, but then the
connection is aborted either by SNA Server due to either an invalid username or
password, or by some user action (such as clicking Cancel in the SNA Server
Logon dialog box), the Snakrnl.dll file does not report a lost locality
correctly. Because the lost locality is not reported correctly, a
WinAPPCStartup() call issued by the 5250/APPC application may return
successfully, even though SnaBase is not started. If the application then issues
a TP_START verb, it will stop responding indefinitely.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below. The Snakrnl.dll file
has been updated to correctly report the lost locality, so that a
WinAPPCStartup() call does not complete successfully if SnaBase fails to start.

This fix is already incorporated into the Windows 95 client for SNA Server 3.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.11 and
2.11 Service Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA
Server 2.11 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack,
