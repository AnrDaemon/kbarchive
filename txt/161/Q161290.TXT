TITLE   :SMS: Network Adapter Card Information Not Correct
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a client computer running Windows 95 is inventoried, the hardware scan may
not report the network adapter card inventory information properly. You may find
the following line in the [Workstation Status] section of the Sms.ini file on
the client:

      FailedHardwareCheck=LanmanNetcardInfo.

This problem occurs if the Ms\Sms\Data directory on the client computer has a
Smssafe.tmp file that contains the following entry:

      LanmanNetcardInfo=Crashed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this
fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.


MORE INFORMATION
----------------

This fix requires you to delete the Smssafe.tmp file and with the
FailedHardwareChecks line of the Sms.ini file. Once that is done, inventory will
report the correct data.
