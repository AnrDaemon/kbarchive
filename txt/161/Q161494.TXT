PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you manually install a driver for the D-Link DE-220 ISA Ethernet network
adapter in Windows NT, you are prompted repeatedly for the Windows NT
Workstation CD-ROM. Windows NT does not read from the CD-ROM drive even if the
Windows NT Workstation CD-ROM is inserted.

RESOLUTION
==========

Allow Windows NT to detect the network adapter instead of manually installing
the driver.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Server 4.0. Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
