TITLE   :FIX: FOR EACH...ENDFOR Does Not Work with Object Variable
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbvfp kbvfp500aFIX kbvfp500bugkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The FOR EACH...ENDFOR command does not work with an object variable in the group
setting. When the group setting is an object variable, the following error
message appears:

   <variable name> cannot be enumerated

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro
5.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The example provided below assumes that the computer has Visual FoxPro 5.0 and
Microsoft Excel for Windows 95 version 7.0a installed. The FOR EACH...ENDFOR
command is not available in earlier versions of FoxPro.

The code opens Excel, adds two workbooks, and lists their names on the Visual
FoxPro desktop.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

Place the following code in a program and run it:

   PUBLIC otest
      otest=CREATE("excel.application")
      otest.Visible=1
      otest.workbooks.ADD
      otest.workbooks.ADD

      FOR EACH wb IN otest.WorkBooks  && this works fine
         ?  wb.Name
      ENDFOR

      myvar = otest.WorkBooks   && create an object variable
      FOR EACH wb IN myvar      && this fails with error message
         ? wb.Name
      ENDFOR
      otest.Quit

The first FOR EACH...ENDFOR loop places the names for the two workbooks on the
Visual FoxPro desktop. The second loop, using the object variable, causes an
error message.

NOTE: In the above example, if you choose to Ignore the first error message, a
"Nesting Error" occurs and the second wb.Name is displayed on the screen.
