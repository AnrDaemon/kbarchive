======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error appears when you try to manipulate a table on an AS/400
using the StarSQL driver included with SNA Server:

   Error 7008 [Starware] [Start SQL ODBC Drivers]
   [DB2/400] file-name Not Valid for operation [#-7008]

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when you try to access non-journaled physical files residing
on an AS/400. If you are using the StarSQL driver that is included with the
Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11, access to non-journaled physical files on
OS/400 V2R3 should work without a problem. The error should occur only with
other versions of OS/400.

WORKAROUND
==========

For access to non-journaled physical files on OS/400 V3R1 you must edit the
Odbc.ini (16 bit ODBC driver), or the Windows 95 or Windows NT Registry (32 bit
ODBC driver) and add the following to the StarSQL data source description:

   IsolationLevel=0

The data source should be deleted and re-added using the ODBC Administrator for
the change to take place properly.

For example, for Windows or Windows for Workgroups (16 bit ODBC Driver), the
ODBC.INI file will look similar to the following:

        [STARSQL]
           Driver:C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\swodbc16.dll
           Description=example for v3r1
           SERVER=RDBELLE
           CatQual=QSYS2
           PkgColID=STARSQL
           Netlib=SWWAPPC.DLL
           ReadOnly=No
           LocalLU=SISYPHUS
           RemoteLU=ELLE
           ModeName=QPCSUPP
           AutoTypDefNam=QTDSQL400
           UID=PETER
           IsolationLevel=0

For Windows NT or Windows 95 (32 bit ODBC Driver), use the Registry Editor
(REGEDT32.EXE or REGEDIT.EXE) to add the following value:

     HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ODBC\ODBC.INI\IsolationLevel
     Data Type of REG_SZ (NT) or String (Windows 95)
     Value of 0 (zero).

The line on Windows NT should appear as: IsolationLevel:REG_SZ:0 The line on
Windows 95 should appear as: IsolationLevel "0"

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information about the IsolationLevel parameter, please refer to the
Advopts.txt file included in the ODBC directory of the corresponding client.
