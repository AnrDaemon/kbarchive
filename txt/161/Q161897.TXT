TITLE   :FIX: Uninstalling Distributed Setup Removes OCX Licenses
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbActiveX kbvfp kbvfp500aFIX kbvfp500bugkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Uninstalling a distributed .exe file by running setup from disk 1 or a network
share and choosing "Remove All," removes the licenses for ActiveX Controls that
were installed as part of your application. Since the licenses for ActiveX
controls were removed, any other application that used the controls is no longer
able to create an instance of the control. They get the following error when
they try using an ActiveX control:

   Appropriate license is not found.

CAUSE
=====

The license key in the registry was removed by the setup program when the user
did a "Remove All." A license key may affect more than one OCX. As an example,
all of the Microsoft ActiveX controls that shipped with Visual FoxPro use a
single license key in the registry. Therefore, if that license key is removed,
ActiveX Controls from other venders may still work but ActiveX Controls from
Microsoft will not.

RESOLUTION
==========

Reinstall the application.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a test folder.

2. Copy the Mscomm32.ocx to the test folder.

3. Create a Test.txt file in the test folder. (The setup program needs a file to
   install.)

4. Run the Setup Wizard on the test folder.
   In step 3, choose Netsetup.
   In step 6, make sure the ActiveX check box in the list of files is checked for
   the Mscomm32.ocx.

5. After the Setup Wizard is finished, run the Setup.exe it created to install
   the test application

6. After the Setup.exe finishes, run it again to get the Maintenance Setup.
   Choose the "Remove All" option.

7. After the Setup.exe finishes, start Visual FoxPro and create a new form.

8. Add an OLE Container to the form.

9. Pick Insert Control from the Insert Object dialog box.

10. Pick the ImageList Control from the Control Type list.
