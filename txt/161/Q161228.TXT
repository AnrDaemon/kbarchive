TITLE   :INIT-SELF Retry Functionality for SNA Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When automatically activating a dependent LU6.2 session, SNA Server sends an
INIT-SELF command to the host, to request that the host send a BIND command to
start the LU6.2 session. If the host sends a negative response to the INIT-SELF
request, SNA Server does not resend the INIT-SELF command unless an APPC or CPIC
application attempts to allocate a new conversation on this dependent LU6.2
session (using [MC_]ALLOCATE or CMINIT). Automatic activation for a dependent
LU6.2 session is configured on the APPC mode definition by setting the Automatic
Activation Limit to "1."

Retry logic for INIT-SELF has been added to SNA Server. This allows SNA Server to
retry an INIT-SELF for a dependent LU 6.2 after it has been rejected by the
host.

NOTE: SNA Server 3.0 does not support the automatic activation of LU6.2 sessions,
so session activation only occurs after an SNA Server APPC or CPIC application
attempts to allocate a conversation over the dependent LU 6.2 LU's, or if
initiated by the host.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following two new registry parameters are now supported:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaServer\Parameters

INITSLFRETRIES: REG_SZ: (default 0) This parameter specifies the number of times
an INITSELF is retried.

INITSLFTICKS: REG_SZ: (default 2) This parameter specifies the number of tick
periods (about 5 seconds) between each retry.

The SNA Server Service must be restarted after making these changes.

Even though this functionality was not included with SNA Server 2.11, a fix that
provides this functionality is available for SNA Server 2.11 Service Pack 1.
