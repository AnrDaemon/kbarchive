TITLE   :SMS: Despooler Error: 'WIN32 ERROR = 32'
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbusage kbDespooler smsdespoolerkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A single job may cause the distribution process to stop responding. The job in
question will report the following error in the Despooler log file:

   found ready instruction file for 1000tS01.ins
   failed to open <path to INS file in Despoolr> WIN32 ERROR = 32
   Cannot decompress instruction file

The status of all new jobs created after this process will remain Pending, and
the original job will not complete until either Despooler or Smsexec are stopped
and restarted.

CAUSE
=====

Despooler attempts to read the INS file passed to it by Lansend before Lansend
has released its file lock. Consequently, Despooler cannot access the INS file.
Despooler should try to read the INS file again at the next polling cycle, but
is not doing so.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, manually stop and restart the Sms_executive
service. Use the following AT scheduling commands to stop and restart the
service on a daily or weekly basis.

      at \\anfield 21:00 /every:m,t,w,th,f,s,su "c:\winnt\stop.bat"

      Stop.bat = net stop sms_executive

      at \\anfield 21:20 /every:m,t,w,th,f,s,su "c:\winnt\start.bat"

      Start.bat = net start sms_executive

NOTE: Start the scheduler service on the site server as an administrator user.

STATUS
