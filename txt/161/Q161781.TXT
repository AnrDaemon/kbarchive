SYMPTOMS
========

When looking at a client's properties with the Systems Management Server
Administrator program, a dialog box containing the following message appears:

   Unable to get NetBIOS Lana list

Or, when clicking on the Help Desk icon in the client properties of a client
computer running either Windows for Workgroups or Windows 95, a dialog box
containing the following message appears:

   SMS Remote Control

   No NetBIOS Lana numbers are available.

A second dialog box reports the following:

   SMS.EXE - DLL Initialization failed.

   Initialization of dynamic link library d:\sms\site.srv\x86.bin\sightnt.dll

   Failed Process is terminating abnormally.

A third dialog box may also appear with the following message:

   Microsoft SMS Administrator

   Couldn't load a Machine Properties DLL: sightnt.dll

Finally, the client's properties are loaded without the Help Desk icon.

The NetBIOS Interface network service has either not been correctly installed or
configured on the computer running the SMS Administrator program.
