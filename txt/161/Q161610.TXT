The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0a 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0a 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Visual SourceSafe version 5.0 includes two new utilities, SSARC.EXE and
SSRESTOR.EXE. These utilities allow the Visual SourceSafe Administrator to
archive and restore files and projects within Visual SourceSafe databases.

Visual SourceSafe version 4.0 shipped three different builds: 811 (version 4.0),
831 (version 4.0), and 1309 (version 4.0a). You can find out which build you are
using by clicking About on the Help menu.

The actual format of the Visual SourceSafe database did not change between builds
811 and 831 (both are version 4.0) or build 1309 (version 4.0a) and Visual
SourceSafe version 5.0. However, the format did change between 831 and 1309.

When you use SSARC.EXE and SSRESTOR.EXE on a version 4.0 database (builds 811 or
831), it is 'silently' upgraded to the new 4.0a/5.0 format. When this upgrade
occurs, you cannot use the executables from version 4.0 (builds 811 and 831).
Under this condition you may get the following error message:

   Incompatible database version.

RESOLUTION
==========

Upgrade to Visual SourceSafe version 4.0a or higher before using the SSARC.EXE
and SSRESTOR.EXE. You can get version 4.0a by contacting Microsoft Technical
Support.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
