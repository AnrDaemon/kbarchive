SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Information Store Integrity Checker (Isinteg.exe) is used
with the -PATCH option to modify the base GUID (generated unique ID or globally
unique identifier) used by an information store. This procedure is performed
after an information store is restored to ensure that the GUIDs assigned to
objects in the information store are unique.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A GUID is a 64-bit hexadecimal string that uniquely identifies a particular
object. In the information store, the public and private information stores have
base GUIDs that are used to generate GUIDs for all other objects, including
folders, messages, and attachments.

After you restore an information store, the information store does not know which
GUIDs have already been assigned. If you do not change the base GUID, the public
and private information stores may generate GUIDs that are not unique.
