TITLE   :XFOR: MSMI Message Sent Time Stamp Is Incorrect
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Messages that come from a Microsoft Mail postoffice (PO) that must go through
Microsoft Exchange Server and over an X.400 connector to another Microsoft Mail
PO have the Sent time changed to the current time.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Mail Connector changes the time stamp during the conversion from
Microsoft Mail format to the Microsoft Exchange Server format.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K


MORE INFORMATION
================

The most likely way you will see this problem is if the message coming from the
Microsoft Mail PO is not delivered in a timely manner. For example, if the PCMTA
or Microsoft Mail Connector is down for a period of time, the message from the
Microsoft Mail PO waits for these services to be restarted. When the message
does get processed by the Microsoft Mail Connector, the Sent time is changed to
the current time.
