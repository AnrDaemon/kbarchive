TITLE   :Access Violation with Multiple PU Passthrough Connections
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you activate multiple PU passthrough connections, an access violation may
occur in Snaservr.exe in function s1pncpua_activate_pupassthru().

CAUSE
=====

The access violation can occur when a mode-setting command (for example, SABME
for DLC connections) is forwarded before the partner's link and station Control
Blocks are set up. This only happens if the mode-setting command is received
before an XID exchange, which can only happen for PU type 2 Nodes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
