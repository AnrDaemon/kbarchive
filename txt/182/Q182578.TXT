TITLE   :MC_CONFIRMED Stops Following what_rcvd=AP_CONFIRM_DEALLOCATE

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an APPC application is using confirmation processing on an LU6.2 conversation
and receives an MC_RECEIVE_AND_WAIT response with a what_rcvd value of
AP_CONFIRM_DEALLOCATE (0x0400), the application's call to MC_CONFIRMED may stop
responding.


CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server was not resetting an error indicator on an internal LU6.2 control
block between reuses of the control block. So, if an error occurs on a prior
conversation over a session (for example, following an APPC application issuing
an [MC_]SEND_ERROR), the current conversation may fail unexpectedly when the
current session is brought down incorrectly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, 3.0 SP2, and 3.0 SP3. Microsoft is researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
