TITLE   :SNA API Traces May Fail to Capture CMALLC or Allocate Failures
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If CPIC or APPC API tracing is enabled for SNA Applications, and the APING
sample program is run while the SNA Server service is stopped, the API traces
only capture up to the CPIC CMALLC and APPC ALLOCATE requests. Although the
APING application fails with a CPIC Error 20, the CPIC CMALLC and APPC
MC_ALLOCATE errors and any further API traces are not captured in the trace
files.

This problem also affects LU6.2 message tracing. The LU6.2 message traces capture
the OPEN(LU62) request, but not the error response.

This problem is not specific to APPC or CPIC applications. This tracing problem
can also occur with LUA RUI or SLI applications, if the LUA application ends
suddenly after receiving an LUA API error.


CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT SNA Application tracing module (Dbgtrace.dll) fails to flush
trace buffer data before the application ends. In this case, the APING program
ends immediately after receiving the error, causing the trace buffer to fail to
be flushed to the trace file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version
4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
