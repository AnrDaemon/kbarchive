SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running Edbutil with the /d option, the following error message may
appear:

   Operation terminated with error -1811

Additionally, you may see the following errors in the event log:

   Event ID 63
   Source Edb
   Description:
   Unable to write a shadowed header for file x:\exchsrvr\bin\temp.edb

   Event ID 50

   Description:
   The database engine could not access the file called
   x:\exchsrvr\bin\temp.edb

NOTE: This has also been seen in Edbutil /mh.

CAUSE
=====

This error can be caused by not having the proper permissions on the bin
directory when the hard disk drive is formatted as NTFS.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, set the permissions on the bin directory to full
control for the administrators group, or explicitly set permissions for the user
needing to run this utility.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The file permissions are set as follows:

1. Go to the bin directory via Windows Explorer.

2. Get Properties of the directory.

3. Go to the Security tab and select Permissions.

4. Click Add and select the administrators group or the person required to run
   this utility.

5. Change the Access type to full control, and click OK. You should now be able
   to run this utility without getting the -1811 error.
