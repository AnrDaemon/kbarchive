TITLE   :XADM: NDR After Information Store Stops Unexpectedly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you send a message and then the information store stops unexpectedly before
the message has been delivered, you may receive a non-delivery report (NDR).

CAUSE
=====

When a Microsoft Exchange Server computer is unable to deliver a message because
of a transient system failure, it may attempt to deliver the message again, or
you may receive an NDR. If the server determines that the problem is temporary,
it attempts to deliver the message again. If the server determines that the
problem is permanent, it does not attempt to deliver the message again and you
receive an NDR.

The information store contains a list of problems that the server should consider
temporary. If the specific circumstances under which the information store stops
unexpectedly are not in this list, the server does not attempt to deliver the
message again and you receive an NDR.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information about obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
