TITLE   :XFOR: Incorrect Envelope Information When Meeting Request Is For
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - LinkAge Message Exchange, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a meeting request is forwarded from an OV/VM User to an Exchange Server
user, it has incorrect envelope information.

This problem only occurs when the meeting request is forwarded. If regular e-mail
is used instead, then everything works fine.

CAUSE
=====

Currently there is no cross-platform calendaring between Exchange Server users
and OV\VM Users. However, it is not unusual to use the above method to manually
perform cross-platform calendaring. When an OV/VM meeting request is forwarded
to an Exchange Server user, the item arrives in the mail box as an e-mail
message; it is not a calendar item that the user can accept or reject. If the
user wants to add it to their calendar, then they must manually add it to the
calendar.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Linkage Message Exchange version
3.2.and Exchange Server version 5.5.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
