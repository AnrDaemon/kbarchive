TITLE   :Numeric Edit Fields Allow Non-numeric Input
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Component Builder (CB), numeric edit controls (used to enter
numeric data) will accept non-numeric data, if it is pasted, not typed. At
least, the controls give the appearance of accepting the data. The value of the
data defaults to zero and does not cause a problem at runtime, unless zero is
the wrong value.

Although the controls prevent you from typing non-numeric data, they do allow you
to paste non-numeric data.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft COM Transaction
Integrator for CICS and IMS version 1.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
