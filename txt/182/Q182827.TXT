PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send or receive postscript attachments via the Exchange Internet Mail
Service, the Exchange information store may use 100 percent of the CPU time.
When you view the Internet Mail Service queues in the Exchange Administrator
program there is a message in the queue that appears to be stuck. The message
may appear in either the Inbound Awaiting Conversion queue or the Outbound
Awaiting Conversion queue.


CAUSE
=====

The Exchange information store is failing to convert the attachment into a
Quoted-Printable MIME message body part per RFC 1521.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server versions 5.0 and
5.5. A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless
you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that
you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
