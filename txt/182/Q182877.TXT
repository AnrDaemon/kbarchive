SYMPTOMS
========

When you select the Reverse Print Order option in Microsoft Word and print to an
Epson Stylus 500, the printout may not print in reverse print order.

CAUSE
=====

The Epson Stylus 500 also has a Reverse Page Order option in the printer driver
properties. If you turn on both this option and the Reverse Print Order option
in Word, your document is not printed in reverse order.

RESOLUTION
==========

To print in reverse print order, select either the Reserve Page Order option in
the Epson Stylus 500 printer driver, or the Reverse Print Order option in Word,
but do not select both at the same time.

To locate the Reverse Print Order option in Word, click Options on the Tools menu
and then click the Print tab.

To locate the Reverse Page Order option in the Epson Stylus 500 printer driver,
click Print on the File menu. In the Print dialog box, click Properties and then
click the Main tab.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Selecting the Reverse Print Order option prints pages in reverse order,
beginning with the last page.

For more information about Reverse Print Order, click Contents And Index on the
Help menu, click the Index tab in Help Topics: Microsoft Word, type the

and then double-click the selected text to go to the "Print in reverse order"
topic. If you are unable to find the information you need, ask the Office
Assistant.
