KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Workstation allows the configuration of DSPU (DownStream Physical Units) and
PU Passthrough connections. These features should only be available in the SNA
Server product.

Microsoft SNA Workstation is a single-user version of SNA Server that supports
access to SNA networks from a single Windows NT computer. SNA Workstation
supports SNA connectivity from the SNA Workstation computer but does not support
gateway access from a client computer.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server/Workstation management functions did not include a check that
would disable the Downstream and PU Passthrough "Remote End" options on the
connection properties dialog box on an SNA Workstation installation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
