KEYWORDS:kbhw osr2 win95 kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a CardBus PC Card in a computer running Microsoft Windows 95 OEM
Service Release 2 (OSR2), the PC Card may not function properly.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when the CardBus PC Card is not enumerated properly. This
issue is known to occur on computers that use the following PC Card controller
chip sets:

 - Texas Instruments PCI1220

 - Texas Instruments PCI1221

 - Texas Instruments PCI1250

 - Texas Instruments PCI1250A

CLKRUN is a power-saving feature which turns off the clock signal to PC Cards
when they are not in use. When this feature is implemented by the controllers
listed above, these controllers do not automatically provide the number of clock
cycles most PC Cards need in order to initialize.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.

MORE INFORMATION

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double- click
   System.

2. Click the Device Manager tab, and then double-click PCMCIA Socket branch to
