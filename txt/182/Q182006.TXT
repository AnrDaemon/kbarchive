SYMPTOMS
========

When you use FTP clients that call the SIZE command, Internet Information Server
(IIS) locks files on the FTP server and will not release them until IIS is
completely shut down. As a result, locked files cannot be deleted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

WORKAROUND
==========

To temporarily correct the problem, stop and restart IIS 4.0. You can do this
with the following two commands:

   Net stop iisadmin /y
   Net start iisadmin

This will also stop the World Wide Web Publishing Service.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Server version 4.0. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service
Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Rename the existing files in the \WINNT\SYSTEM32\INETSRV folder and copy
   version 4.02.0634.
