SUMMARY
=======

When you access a computer running Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 or 5.5
by means of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), you may need to be
authorized with a valid Windows NT account. This article describes how to do
this.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you access the Exchange Server directory by means of LDAP with Anonymous
disabled, you need to pass a valid account to log on. Depending on the LDAP
client software used, you will be prompted separately for your account and
password. When prompted for your account, pass the following data

   CN=<NTAccount>,CN=<NTDomain>

where <NTAccount> is a valid Windows NT account with permissions on the
Exchange Server directory and <NTDomain> is a valid domain. You can also
specify the <NTAccount> with the following syntax:

   dc=<NTDomain>, cn=<NTAccount>

Additional query words: CN= validation
