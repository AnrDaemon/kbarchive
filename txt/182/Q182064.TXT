KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a Win32 APPC application over SNA Server 4.0 on a DEC Alpha system,
the APPC application may stop on an [MC_]DEALLOCATE call or fail unexpectedly.


CAUSE
=====

The Alpha version of the SNA Server service (Snaservr.exe) included with SNA
Server 4.0 was built using a compiler optimization that introduced a problem
with an internal function, causing the problem to occur. This problem does not
occur on Intel-based servers.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version
4.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
