TITLE   :SNA Server Notifies Windows NT Clients of All Invokable TPs
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server notifies all SNA Server Windows NT clients of all invokable
transaction programs (TPs) registered in the SNA dubdomain, even though the SNA
Windows NT clients ignore these entries. This problem may cause no observable
symptoms. However, it can cause excessive network traffic between SNA Windows NT
clients and SNA Server computers if a large number of invokable TPs are
registered within an SNA Server subdomain. This excessive traffic may lead to
LAN connectivity problems between SNA Server Windows NT clients and the SNA
Server computer.


CAUSE
=====

Each SNA Server keeps track of all invokable transaction programs (TPs)
registered on all servers and clients within the SNA Server subdomain. When SNA
Server receives an FMH-5 attach message for a specific TP name, SNA Server
routes the request to the appropriate server or client computer. Although SNA
Server needs to advertise all registered invokable TPs to all other SNA Server
computers in the subdomain, it also advertises these entries to all attached SNA
Server Windows NT clients, which ignore this information.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3 and 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA
Server version 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
