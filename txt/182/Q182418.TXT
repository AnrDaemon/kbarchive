TITLE   :SMS: Site Config Manager Cannot Use a Preferred Drive Letter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSCMan smssiteconfigman

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using Specified Servers in <Site Properties>\<Domains>, it is
possible to specify a drive letter for Systems Management Server Site
Configuration Manager to use when installing shares and services.

However when enumerating a domain, there is currently no way to provide for a
preferred drive letter. The Systems Management Server Site Configuration Manager
will create the Systems Management Server root directory (and shares it as
SMS_SHRx) and the SMS_SHR share on the NTFS drive with the most free space on
all logon servers. If no NTFS drive exists, it chooses the drive with the most
available space even it is a FAT drive.

WORKAROUND
==========

To ensure that the Systems Management Server files will be installed on a
specific drive on your Logon Server, make sure that the drive is an NTFS drive
and that it has the most free space.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
