TITLE   :Access Is Denied When Attempting to Put Files on FTP Server
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFAQ

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you delete a file and then immediately copy a file with the same name to
the FTP server, an "Access is Denied" error message may occur. The following
command sequence will result in the "Access is Denied" error:

   

   PUT myfile.txt
   [file is transferred to FTP server]
   GET myfile.txt
   [file is transferred from FTP server to FTP client]
   DEL myfile.txt
   [file is deleted from FTP server]
   PUT myfile.txt
   [file is supposed to be transferred to FTP server,
   however, you will get an "Access is denied" message]

CAUSE
=====

The FTP server caches the file handles of the deleted files that were previously
fetched preventing their deletion. After a minimum cache sweep period, the file
finally gets deleted when the cached file handle is closed. If the same file is
put on the server before this minimum sweep interval has elapsed, the Put
command fails with the "Access is Denied" error message.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the problem, do one of the following:

After deleting the file, wait for a short time (about 30 seconds), and then copy
(put) the new file to the FTP server.

-or-

Rename the file that is to be deleted, copy the new file to the FTP server, and
then delete the renamed file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Server version 4.0.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The following registry information may also be helpful in regards to this
issue.

Please be aware that by adding the following registry information, you may
negatively impact the performance of the FTP server.

If you want to completely disable file caching on your server, set the following
parameter:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\InetInfo\Parameters\DisableMemoryCache
   DWORD 1

If you want to set a time value for caching set:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\InetInfo\Parameters\ObjectCacheTTL
   DWORD <value_in_seconds>

You can set these parameters under the following as well:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3SVC\Parameters

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSFTPSVC\Parmeters

However, here is the hierarchy:

If a value is set under Inetinfo, then that is the value that is used, as this is
the host for W3svc.dll and Ftpsvc2.dll. If you set the value under W3SVC, then
this is used not only for W3SVC but also MSFTPSVC. Therefore, if you set the
W3SVC ObjectCacheTTL to 120 (seconds) and the MSFTPSVC DisableMemoryCache to 1,
then everything is cached for 120 seconds.

Try checking for these parameters (particularly a time value for ObjectCacheTTL)
and test by adding the DisableMemoryCache key under Inetinfo to see if that
resolves the issue.
