TITLE   :XCON: X.25 Cards Supported Through Direct Hardware Interface
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Exchange Server supports Eicon X.25 cards by communicating directly
with the hardware, rather than communicating with the hardware through a device
driver. This makes it difficult to add support for additional X.25 cards,
because Microsoft Exchange Server must be modified to support additional cards.

Most other devices are supported by communicating with the hardware through a
device driver, which makes it relatively easy to add support for additional
devices. Support for additional devices is provided by additional device
drivers, which can easily be installed on an existing Microsoft Exchange Server
computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft recognizes the need for Exchange Server to support additional X.25
cards. We have modified the Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 message transfer agent
(MTA) so that X.25 cards are supported by communicating with the hardware
through the Windows sockets API (Winsock). Support for additional X.25 cards can
now be provided by Winsock-compatible device drivers supplied by the hardware
manufacturer. This feature is included in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 U.S. Service Pack. For information about obtaining the Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

The Exchange Server documentation states that the Eicon cards are the only X.25
cards supported by Exchange Server. This is not true; in some cases, X.25 cards
manufactured by Cirel and SAT are also supported. For additional information
about X.25 support for Cirel and SAT cards in Exchange Server, please see the
following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
