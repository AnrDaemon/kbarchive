SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to dial out using a PC Card modem on a Toshiba Satellite 200C
computer, you may receive the following error message:

   Another program is using this telephony device.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you use the SystemSoft CardWizard that is included
with the Toshiba Satellite 200C computer. The SystemSoft CardWizard detects the
modem and creates a .inf file that prevents Windows 95 from correctly detecting
the modem.

obtain this file, contact Toshiba or visit the following Toshiba Web site:
