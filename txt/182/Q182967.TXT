SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience either of the following symptoms:

 - The DIR command displays file dates using only two digits to represent the
   year, instead of four digits.

 - When you use the DATE command to set the current date and you type the year
   as only two digits from 00 through 79, the DATE command displays the error
   message "Incorrect date format."

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, type the year using four digits when you set the
date to 1/1/2000 or later using the DATE command.

To resolve this issue, obtain and install the Windows 95 Year 2000 Update.
