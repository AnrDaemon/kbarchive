TITLE   :BUG: Compile Error on Print Statement in a With..End Block
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You invoke the Print method from within a With..End block, as follows:

      With Form1
         .Print "Generates Error"
      End With

When you run the project, the following error message is displayed:

   Compile Error
   Method or Data not found.

CAUSE
=====

"Print" is a reserved word. If Print is used within a With statement, Visual
Basic incorrectly parses the word.

RESOLUTION
==========

Explicitly reference the object when invoking the Print method. For example, use
the following code sample to eliminate this behavior:

      Form1.Print "Printed on the Form."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Copy the following code to the Code window of Form1:

         Option Explicit

         Private Sub Form_Click()
            With Form1
                .Print "Generates Error"
            End With

            'To use the workaround code, comment the
            'previous three lines and uncomment the
            'following line:

            'Form1.Print "Desired Behavior"
         End Sub

3. On the Run menu, click Start or press the F5 key to start the program. Click
   on the Form, and note that the following error message appears:

   Compile Error
   Method or Data not found.
