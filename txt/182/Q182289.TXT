PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp kbVBp500 kbVBp600 kbOSWin98 kbGrpDSVBDB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the Remote Data Control and DBGrid can cause Visual Basic to crash when
scrolling horizontally in the DBGrid (dbgrid32.ocx).

RESOLUTION
==========

Either size the grid so there is no need to scroll horizontally or implement the
FlexGrid control.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs in Microsoft Windows 95 and Microsoft Windows 98. The sample
code works fine in Microsoft Windows Me and Visual Basic 6.0 Service Pack 4.


Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following SQL Server script file on SQL Server:

         if exists (select * from sysobjects
           where id = object_id('dbo.test') and sysstat & 0xf = 3)
          drop table dbo.test
         GO

         CREATE TABLE dbo.test
         ( id int NOT NULL , a char (255) NULL , b char (255) NULL ,
         c char (255) NULL , d char (255) NULL )
         GO

   NOTE: Please make sure to choose an appropriate database, such as pubs, in
   which to create this Table.

2. Create a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

3. Under Components on the Project menu, check the Microsoft Remote Data Control
   and Microsoft Data Bound Grid. Add a Remote Data Control, a DBGrid, and a
   CommandButton to Form1. Under Project References select Remote Data Object
   2.0.

4. Set the appropriate properties for the Remote Data Control to connect with
   the Server. Create a DSN for the Master database and place the name of the
   dsn in the datasource name property of the Remote Data Control In the SQL
   property enter "Select * from test" without the quotes.

5. Set the following properties for the DBGrid control accordingly:

         DataSource = MSRDC1

6. Add the following code to the CommandButton's Click method:

         Dim con As rdoConnection
         Dim rs As rdoResultset
         Set con = rdoEngine(0).OpenConnection("", _
            rdDriverNoPrompt, _
            false, _
            "DRIVER={SQL Server};" _
            & "SERVER=<server_name>;" _
            & "UID=<userID>;" _
            & "PWD=<password>;" _
            & "DATABASE=<databasename>")"
         For i = 1 To 30
          Set rs = con.OpenResultset("INSERT INTO test (id,a,b,c)" _
           & " VALUES (" & i & " ,'" & CStr(i) _
           & "','2222222222222222222222222','3333333333333333333333333')")"
          Debug.Print i
         Next i

7. Save the Project and run it.

8. When the form is loaded, press the CommandButton to populate the table,
   MSRDC, and grid. Close the form and run it again.

9. When the grid is populated, scroll down using the mouse and the DOWN ARROW
   button on the grid, and then try scrolling to the right.
