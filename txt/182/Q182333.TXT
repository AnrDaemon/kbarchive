TITLE   :Excessive Processor Usage on Print Servers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Print servers show high processor usage (70 percent to 90 percent) in
Performance Monitor. The print servers also receive RPC Server Too Busy errors,
and clients report slow printing problems.

CAUSE
=====

These symptoms occur because named pipe connections and server sessions are not
timing out and disconnecting, which causes an excessive load on the server.
Other symptoms of this issue are a high handle count for Spoolss.exe (more than
15,000) and a high number of named pipes or spoolss sessions for any one user
connected to the server.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT 3.51
---------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the following fix.

This is a client fix that will result in idle pipes from the client to the print
server being closed. The more clients it is applied to, the more relief the
print server will experience.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
