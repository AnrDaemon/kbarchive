   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade to Exchange Server 5.5, the upgrade fails and the following
error message appears:

   System could not find the path specified (0xC0020003)

This occurs immediately after the option to upgrade or uninstall Exchange.

CAUSE
=====

The Key Management (KM) server was not removed completely during a previous
upgrade attempt.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this problem, the registry key responsible for the KM service,
MSExchangeKMS, must be deleted. To do this:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and navigate to the following registry
   subtree:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeKMS

2. From the Edit menu, click Delete.

3. Click OK, and then quit the Registry Editor.

4. Restart the server for the registry changes to take effect.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This workaround allows Exchange Server 5.5 to upgrade the existing server. To
regain the functionality of the Key Management server, the KM server must be
reinstalled.
