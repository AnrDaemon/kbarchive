TITLE   :FIX: Files in External Dependencies Folder Don't Persist
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINNT:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbide kbVC kbVC500bug kbVC600fix kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

No files appear in the External Dependencies folder until you export a makefile
or rebuild the project.

When you close the workspace, the dependency information is not saved.

When you edit a header file and build the project, the header file is saved but
no files are compiled.

CAUSE
=====

The program database (a .pdb file) has been given a name without an extension or
a trailing slash (\).

For example, on the Project menu, click Settings. Click the C/C++ tab; in the
Project Options edit box you see a switch similar to the following:

   /Fd"Debug\mypdb"

RESOLUTION
==========

If you want to name the .pdb file, then append the .pdb extension to the name:

   /Fd"Debug\mypdb.pdb"

If you want to specify the directory in which to place the VC50.pdb file, then
append a trailing slash to the name:

   /Fd"Debug\mypdb\"

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++
6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is normal for project dependency information not to be available until the
project is built or until a makefile is exported. However, when a project is
built with the /FD switch, the compiler creates a file that contains the
dependency information for the project. This file has the same base name as the
program database (.pdb) file. By default, the file is VC50.idb.

Once a project is built, Developer Studio uses the dependency information from
the .idb file (unless you encounter this bug).

If you export a makefile, an .idb file is not generated. Dependency information
generated to export the makefile is lost when you close the workspace. This is
by design.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Build a project.

2. On the Project menu, click Settings. Click the C/C++ tab, and in the Project
   Options edit box, name the .pdb file without an extension. For example, in a
   sample named AutoBld, you would use the following switch:

      /Fd"Debug/AutoBld"

3. Make a change to a header file.

4. Build the project.

      Result: 0 error(s), 0 warning(s)

      Expected: something should compile

To work around this bug, use one of the following:

   /Fd"Debug/AutoBld.pdb"

-or-

   /Fd"Debug/AutoBld/"
