SYMPTOMS
========

After you install SNA Server on a Windows NT Workstation (for evaluation
purposes only, as this configuration is not supported), SNA Server lists the
Host Security Domain in the tree view and gives the option to add a Host
Security Domain via the Insert option.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server did not verify whether it was being installed on a Windows NT Server
or Windows NT Workstation when Host Security was selected during the Setup
process.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
