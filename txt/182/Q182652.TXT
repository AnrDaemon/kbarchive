TITLE   :Memory Leak When Transactional Method Fails Before Connect
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

COMTI state machines are not reused if an application method invocation fails
before a connection is established. A memory leak can be observed by the use of
monitoring techniques. Memory used by Mtx.exe grows by about 6 kilobytes PER
METHOD invocation.

NOTE: This leak only happens on transactional calls.

CAUSE
=====

This memory leak can occur when a COMTI application is in the midst of a
transaction and there is something wrong with its Remote Environment (RE)
configuration or the RE is inactive. You can correct the RE while the
transaction is in-flight and go ahead with repetitive method invocations within
the same Transaction Server process. Meanwhile, COMTI state machines have been
allocated for the unsuccessful method invocations that occurred before the RE
was corrected. These unusable state machines are left intact, using memory and
being examined and rejected on each method invocation. So, there is more
processing overhead incurred in addition to the memory leak.

WORKAROUND
==========

Correct the erroneous RE and stop/start all Microsoft Transaction Server server
processes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft COM Transaction
Integrator for CICS and IMS version 1.0. This problem was corrected in the
latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
