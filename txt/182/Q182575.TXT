The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the IBM Personal Communications (for AS/400) version 4.1 Data
Transfer utility, the Remote APPC LU names may fail to appear. Also, any APPC
application that uses the SNA Server DISPLAY function may retrieve duplicate
Remote APPC LUs and APPC Modes and will fail to retrieve dynamically defined
Remote APPC LUs.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server service is incorrectly reporting multiple instances of Remote
APPC LUs and Modes and fails to report dynamically defined Remote APPC LUs.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3 and 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA
Server version 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
