TITLE   :Services on SNA Server Are Incorrectly Enumerated
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you select an SNA Server computer in SNA Server Manager, a message appears at
the top of the right pane that indicates an incorrect number of configured
services for that SNA Server.

For example, selecting an SNA Server computer named SNASERV1 in the left pane of
Manager results in a message similar to the following at the top of the right
pane in Manager:

   Services on 'SNASERV1' (<number of configured services>)

The problem is that the number of configured services shown in this message will
always be one more than the actual number of configured services for the
selected SNA Server computer.

CAUSE
=====

Some folders in Manager are being counted as a service, which causes the number
of configured services to be off by one.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
