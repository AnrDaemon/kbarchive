1. Edit the .csv file, and add the "Mode" (without the quotation marks) field
   header to the immediate right of the Obj-Class field.

2. Add "Delete" (without the quotation marks) in the Mode field next to the name
   that you are removing.

3. Import the modified .csv file by using the Directory Import command from the
   Tools menu of the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program.

After importing the file, the user with the "Delete" transaction is removed.
