PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running Store.exe under a debugger, the information store shuts
itself down with the following stack dump information:

 FramePtr  RetAddr   Param1   Param2   Param3   Function Name
 0207f5b4  0052d1fb  01256274 00000000 01262b1c
 STORE!StrcpyWszToWsz+0x22(0x0207F7D8, 0x02080000, 0x0052D1FB)
 0207f5d0  0052d421  0207f63c 0207f5fc 0207f61c
 STORE!MidszFromPrv+0xfb(0x0207F7D8, 0x0052D421, 0x0207F63C, 0x0207F5FC,
 0x0207F61C, 0x0207F60C, 0x02080000)
 0207f648  0052da44  00000000 0207f814 0207f89c
 STORE!EcMidszFromJtab+0x1b1(0x01256A9C, 0x02080000)
 0207f7b4  0052bdea  00000001 01258bec 1071cd24
 STORE!EcWszFromRgmid+0xc4(0x01256A9C, 0x0052bdea, 0x00000001, 0x01256a9c)
 0207f830  00490052  00310030 0045004b 004e0059
 STORE!EcMchszFromFolderMessagesHeader+0x6a(0x02080000, 0x01256A9C,
 0x00490052)

CAUSE
=====

When the Store replicates Public Folder information, a number that exceeds the
storage limit for a variable is passed to the memcpy function. This causes an
exception, which shuts the Store down. The stack dump will look like the Store
passed a negative number to the memcpy function.

==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the following fix or wait for the next Exchange
Server service pack.
