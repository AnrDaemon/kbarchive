TITLE   :XFOR: Extra Designators in Korean ISO-2022-KR Encoded Messages
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server Internet Mail Connector (IMC) version 4.0 SP4
inserts additional designators in the message body for Korean ISO-2022-KR
encoded messages. An ISO-2022-KR designator is defined as the following sequence
of characters per RFC1557:

   ESC "$" ")" "C"

These additional designators may cause some e-mail clients to display additional
blank lines for each designator. Thus, the formatting of the ISO- 2022-KR
message that the recipient receives may be displayed with extra blank lines
between every line of text.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0 SP4. This problem has been fixed in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0 and Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5.
