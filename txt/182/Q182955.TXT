TITLE   :XWEB: Some MHTML and HTML Messages Are Not Displayed Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Messages may not display correctly when you use Microsoft Outlook Web Access
(OWA) to open the following types of messages:

 - Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions Hypertext Markup Language (MHTML)
   messages in which pictures or other objects have been inserted. The objects
   are displayed as attachments instead of being displayed in the message.

 - Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) messages that contain relative links. These
   messages are not displayed correctly even if the BASE element is properly
   defined in the HTML header.

CAUSE
=====

These problems occur for the following reasons:

 - MHTML messages that contain pictures or other inserted objects are not
   displayed properly because the message is not correctly converted to Rich
   Text Format (RTF).

 - HTML messages that contain relative links are not displayed correctly because
   the HTML header is not maintained when the message is opened in OWA. The HTML
   header contains the BASE element, which is necessary for a relative link to
   function properly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information about obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
