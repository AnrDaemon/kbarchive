SYMPTOMS
========

Services running on a computer running Windows NT Server will change locale when
an administrator logs on at the console that has a different locale. Operations
that use the locale may fail.

CAUSE
=====

When the administrator, or an account with equivalent privileges, logs on to the
console, the System Default locale is changed to match the locale of the logged
on user.

RESOLUTION
==========

The only current workaround is to ensure that the accounts that log on to the
console use the same locale as the System Default locale. The simplest way to
ensure these are the same is to create an administrator level account, or rename
the existing Administrator account, whose sole use is to log on to the console.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
