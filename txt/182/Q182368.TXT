KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open Microsoft Exchange Client, you may receive the following error
message:

   C:\<dirname>\EXCHNG32.EXE is not a valid Win32 application

CAUSE
=====

Exchng32.exe is damaged or corrupted.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this issue, you can either install a new copy of the Exchange Client
from the original compact disc or you can extract a new copy of Exchng32.exe.

NOTE: Installing a new copy of Exchng32.exe does not correct any other file
corruption in the Exchange directory.

For information about using the Extract tool, type "extract" (without quotation
marks) at the command prompt, or see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

If the version of Exchange Client you are using is the Windows messaging client
that ships with Windows 95, you may reinstall the client by using the Add/Remove
Programs icon in Control Panel. Uncheck the Windows Messaging checkbox from the
Setup tab, and the select Apply. Reselect the checkbox to reinstall the
messaging client.
