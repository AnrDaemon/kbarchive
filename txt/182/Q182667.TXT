TITLE   :Cannot Use Return Value as OCCURS DEPENDING ON Index
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using Component Builder (CB), it is not possible to use a return value for
the length specifier of an OCCURS DEPENDING ON (ODO) output parameter.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned in the STATUS section
of this article. With the hotfix, you can use the return value as the length
specifier for an ODO array. For this to work, the following conditions must be
true:

 - The Remote Environment (RE) must be non-link (that is, it must be IMS or
   CICS).

 - The ODO array must be output only.

 - The return value must be a simple numeric type and must occur before the
   array and any other variable-length tables in the buffer (as is the case with
   other ODO arrays).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft COM Transaction
Integrator for CICS and IMS version 1.0. This problem was corrected in the
latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
this Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
