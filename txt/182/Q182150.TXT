TITLE   :PRB: Visual Basic 5.0 Setup Error: DAO350.DLL File In Use
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Setup of Visual Basic 5.0 fails with the following error:

   Setup cannot register DAO350.DLL because an older version is in use.

CAUSE
=====

The computer has a network installation of Office 97 with the shared files
(including DAO350.DLL) on the network server in a read-only folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry. Before
you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if a problem
occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring the Registry"
Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key" Help topic in
Regedt32.exe.

There are two primary solutions to this error:

1. Search the registry for the following key, and export a copy of it for
   safekeeping. Delete the key from the registry, then run the Visual Basic 5.0
   setup. After the setup is finished, import the saved registry key to ensure
   that the Office applications are not affected.

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Shared Tools\DAO350

2. Perform the Visual Basic 5.0 installation only when all users are off the
   server and with update permissions on the server. Network administrative
   policies may not allow this option.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Visual Basic 5.0 setup process checks the registry for existing entries to
DAO files and attempts to update them. If located on the local drive, DAO files
would be placed in following location:

   Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\DAO\

If Office is installed with shared files residing on the network, the folder with
DAO350.DLL file is read-only, and the user may not have permissions to write to
that server directory. In this case, updates cannot not be made and the setup
process fails.

Microsoft Office97 installs DAO350.dll v3.50.3428 dated 11/17/96. Microsoft
Visual Basic 5.0 installs v3.50.3602 dated 12/5/96.

The registry key for the shared location of DAO 3.5 files is:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Shared Tools\DAO350
