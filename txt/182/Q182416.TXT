OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbInventory smsinv

SYMPTOMS
========

After applying Service Pack 3 (SP3) for Systems Management Server 1.2, all
Microsoft Windows for Workgroup and Microsoft Windows 95 clients report a floppy
disk drive B in the inventory even if computers have only one floppy disk drive
(drive A).

This drive is added in the "Disks" icon property without information about the
size of the floppy disk drive (3.5" 1.44 MB for example) in the Storage Type
list.

This problem did not occur prior to Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 3.

WORKAROUND
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. To resolve this problem immediately, contact
Microsoft Technical Support to obtain the fix. If you are not severely impacted
by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next
Systems Management Server service pack that contains this fix.
