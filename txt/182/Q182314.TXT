TITLE   :XADM: DBCS Becomes "?" When You Click "Save Window Contents"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In the Exchange Server Administrator program, when you click "Save Windows
Contexts" on the File menu, Double Byte Charactor Set (DBCS) characters are not
handled properly. All DBCS characters in the Administrator window become
question marks.

CAUSE
=====

This is because the Exchange Server Administrator program (Admin.exe) converts
all UNICODE to Windows ANSI string. Windows ANSI string does not contain the
DBCS table.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
