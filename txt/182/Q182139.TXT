TITLE   :LUA Pool Cannot Be Assigned to Two TN3270 Servers

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server Manager does not allow a single LUA Pool to be assigned to more than
one TN3270 service in an SNA Server subdomain. This prevents multiple TN3270
servers from sharing a large pool of LUA sessions across more than one SNA
Server computer, limiting flexibility in some fail-over configurations.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server Manager was not originally designed to allow a single LUA Pool to be
assigned to more than one TN3270 server in an SNA Server subdomain.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version 3.0
(all service packs) and SNA Server 4.0.

A new feature that allows you to assign a single LUA pool to two TN3270 servers
is now available, but due to the complexity of the configuration changes it has
only been implemented in SNA Server 4.0. Customers using SNA Server 3.0 must
first upgrade to SNA Server 4.0 and then request this enhancement from
Microsoft.

This feature has been released in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following SNA Server 4.0 modules have been updated to support this new
capability:

   <snaroot>\system\snaadmin.dll
   <snaroot>\system\snaole.dll
   <snaroot>\system\snacfg.exe


An LUA Pool can now be assigned to more than one TN3270 server. However, all the
TN3270 properties associated with the LUA Pool must be identical for all TN3270
servers.

When an LUA Pool is assigned to a second TN3270 server, it inherits all the same
properties (including Port number, IP addresses, and so on) that already exist
for that LUA Pool. If any properties are modified on the Pool, then they are
modified for all the TN3270 servers.

A new message is displayed when you try to assign a second instance of an LUA
Pool to a TN3270 server. The message is: "Pool already assigned to this TN3270
Server."

The SNACFG.EXE command-line configuration utility has been updated to reflect
this new capability. There is no new syntax. However, the "tn3session
<name> /ADD" command is now allowed if the name matches an LUA Pool name
and that pool is not already assigned to the TN3270 server. Entering the
"tn3session /DELETE" command will delete the session from all the TN3270 servers
that it is assigned to. Modifying a tn3session will cause all the sessions of
that name to be modified in the same way. For this reason, the /TN3Server option
is no longer valid for the modify operation.

The SNACFG.EXE file is also modified so that a TNIPID /LIST will now show all the
TNIPID records. Entering "TNIPID <name> /ADD /SESSION:<tn3sess>"
will add the record to all the TN3270 sessions with the same name. Entering
TNIPID modify or /DELETE will operate on all the TNIPID records with the same
name.
