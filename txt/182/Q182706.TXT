SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Manager generates an application exception error after the user deletes an
LUA pool and then stops the TN3270 service. This behavior can be reproduced
using the steps below.

1. Start SNA Manager with a mainframe connection containing a range of
   configured LUA LUs.

2. Create an LUA pool and assign the LUs to it.

3. Start the server, activate the connection, and start the TN3270 service.

4. Connect a TN3270 client session.

5. Delete the TN3270 or LUA pool.

6. Delete the LUA LUs from the connection. DO NOT SAVE the configuration yet.

7. Stop the TN3270 service.

The following exception messages will appear:

   SnaExp.exe - Application Error
   The instruction at "0x67709190" referenced memory at "0x00000002". The memory
   could not be "read".

   Click "OK"

   SnaExp.exe - Application Error
   The instruction at "0x762b12b6" referenced memory at "0x00000008". The memory
   could not be "read".

CAUSE
=====

SNA Manager does not release the pointer to the LU from the user object.
