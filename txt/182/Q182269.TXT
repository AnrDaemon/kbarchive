TITLE   :TN3270 Incorrectly Logs Event 902 - TCPRecv Internal Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain timing conditions, the SNA Server TN3270 service may log the
following event:

   Event ID: 902
   Source: TN3270 Server
   Description: Logic error in module TCPRecv identified by:
   IOAlreadyOutstanding

   EXPLANATION
   An unexpected logic error has occurred.

   ACTION
   Record message and contact technical support.

However, this does not cause any TN3270 client connectivity problems. This event
has been reproduced when the Wall Data Rumba TN3270 client is connected through
the SNA Server TN3270 service configured to use an SNA Server 3270 demo link
service or to an actual host application.

CAUSE
=====

In certain timing conditions, the TN3270 service was posting a second TCP/IP
receive request against a socket, while a previous receive command was already
outstanding. This is a benign condition and should not be logged.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0, 3.0 SP1,
3.0 SP2 and 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0
and 4.0 U.S. Service Packs. For information on obtaining these Service Packs,

MORE INFORMATION
================

With this update applied, the TN3270 service no longer logs this specific error
condition.
