TITLE   :XWEB: Korean - Unable to Render This View424Object Required
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade a computer running Exchange Server 5.0 SP1 to version 5.5 and
apply Amkor000.exe (shipped with the Korean Outlook client version 8.03 CD-ROM)
for Korean Outlook Web Access (OWA), you cannot view a Calendar through OWA. The
following error message may appear in Korean:

   Unable to render this view424Object required

CAUSE
=====

The file Amlkor.dll in the %EXCHSRVR%\RES directory was not updated to version
5.5.1960.0.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, manually replace the Amlkor.dll file with the
version 5.5.1960.0 by performing the following procedure:

1. On a separate Windows NT computer, install Korean Windows NT 4.0 plus SP3,
   install Exchange Server 5.5, and apply Amkor000.exe (from the Korean Outlook
   client 8.03 CD-ROM). Notice the Amlkor.dll file version (5.5.1960.0) and
   date-stamp (97-10-29).

2. On the upgraded Exchange Server computer, manually replace Amlkor.dll
   (5.0.1458.58) in the %EXCHSRVR%\RES directory with version 5.5.1960.0.

3. You should now be able to view the Calendar through OWA.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server version 5.5. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
