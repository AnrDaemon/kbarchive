SUMMARY
=======

Rtwizx86.exe is the Resource Type AppWizard for Microsoft Visual C++ on the X86
platform. Rtwizaxp.exe is the Resource Type AppWizard for Microsoft Visual C++
on the RISC platform.

The Resource Type AppWizard helps you create a new resource type. The generated
code provides the structure for resource type functionality, including the
following:

 - DLL entry points and default functionality for each

 - Resources and code for Cluster Administrator extensions

 - Code for setting and retrieving private and common properties

NOTE: The code generated by the Resource Type AppWizard requires ATL version 2.0
or greater and MIDL version 3.00.44 or greater.

To use the Resource Type AppWizard, you need to copy the files in this
distribution to the appropriate location in the Visual C++ directory structure.
If you are using Visual C++ 4.x, you should place Restypaw.awx and Restypaw.hlp
in the C:\Msdev\Template Directory. If you are using Visual C++ 5.0, place
Restyp5.awx and Restypaw.hlp in the C:\Program
Files\Devstudio\Sharedide\Template Directory. Then, rename Restyp5.awx to
Restypaw.awx. Now you can start Visual C++ and create a new project using the
Resource Type App Wizard.

NOTE: the paths above assume that Visual C++ 4.x is located in the C:\Msdev
directory and that Visual C++ 5.0 is located in the C:\Program Files\Devstudio
directory.
