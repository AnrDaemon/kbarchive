KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a CPIC or APPC application attempts to allocate a conversation and specifies
a fully qualified Primary (that is, Remote) APPC LU name (instead of the Remote
LU alias), and the allocation attempt fails, the SNA Server APPC interface logs
Event 93, but does not indicate the fully qualified PLU name in the event. For
example:

   Event ID: 93
   Source:   SNA APPC Application
   Description:
   APPC local conversation start failed:
   Primary_rc   = <Return code>
   Secondary_rc = <Return code>
   TP_ID        = <Transaction program ID>
   Dest TP name = <Destination TP name>
   LU alias     = <Local APPC LU alias>
   PLU alias    = <Remote APPC LU alias>
   Mode name    = <APPC mode name>

   EXPLANATION%
   An attempt to start an APPC conversation locally using the verb
   [MC_]ALLOCATE failed.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server Event 93 was not originally designed to log the fully qualified
PLU name.
