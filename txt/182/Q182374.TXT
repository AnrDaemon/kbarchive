-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In some situations, such as performing a screen save from a TN5250 session to
the AS400, the APPC session fails (the AS/400 rejects one of the messages) and
an Event ID 16 is logged from the TN5250 Service on the SNA Server computer with
the following text:

   The SNA TN5250 Service detected an unexpected passthrough parameter 
   data area flag from the client at <data>.

   The client should not generate this information and it has been
   suppressed. Please verify that the client software has all fix
   updates applied.

CAUSE
=====

In some cases, the data flow comes across two socket calls. The TN5250 Service
is incorrectly handling the second call, causing the problem to occur.
