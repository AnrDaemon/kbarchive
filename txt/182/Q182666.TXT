TITLE   :Inconsistent Length of String When Type Changed to String
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Component Builder (CB), when a method's return value or a parameter is
changed from a non-string type to a string, the default size of the string is
inconsistent.

To demonstrate this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Start Component Builder.

2. From the File menu, select New.

3. In the New Component Library dialog box, click OK.

4. Insert two methods with return values of Integer.

5. Right-click Method1 and bring up the Properties sheet.

6. Click the Automation Definition tab and change the Return Type to String.

7. Click OK.

8. Right-click Method2 and bring up the Properties sheet.

9. Click the Automation Definition tab and change the Return Type to String.

10. Switch to the COBOL Definition tab.

11. Click OK.

Results:

 - Method1 now has a return type of String with a size of 80 bytes.

 - Method2 now has a return type of String with a size of 4 bytes.

WORKAROUND
==========

Manually assure the size of the string is correct in every case.

STATUS
======

Integrator for CICS and IMS version 1.0.
