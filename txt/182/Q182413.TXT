TITLE   :SMS: CTRL+ALT+DEL "Gold Key" May Not Function with IBM PC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtshoot kbsms200 kbsms120 smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When performing Remote Control of certain Systems Management Server Windows NT
clients, the Quick Viewer CTRL + ALT + DEL "Gold Key" for system key pass
through may not work properly. It has no effect on the Systems Management Server
client.

CAUSE
=====

If the Remote Control components of IBM NetFinity are loaded upon installation,
it enables KeyEx and MouX (IBM's keyboard and mouse drivers) by setting keys in
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\... Start: REG_DWORD: to
"0x1". It also disables the KBDCLASS and MOUCLASS (the Microsoft keyboard and
mouse drivers) by setting their keys to "0x4".

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, disable the IBM NetFinity driver (KeyEx) and then
enable the Keyboard Class driver. To prevent this problem from occurring in the
future, do not install the Remote Control component of NetFinity if you plan to
use the Remote Control functionality of Systems Management Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem has been attributed to the IBM NetFinity driver (KeyEx). Certain
IBM computers have the NetFinity driver preinstalled from the manufacturer.
