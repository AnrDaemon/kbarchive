TITLE   :Dynamic Definition of Dependent APPC LUs Doesn't Work Properly
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a dependent Local APPC LU is defined on two different connections (where each
connection is configured to support Dynamic Definition of Remote APPC LUs), and
the APPC application attempts to allocate a conversation over each Local LU to
the same Remote APPC LU, the SNA INITSELF command for both dependent sessions
flows over the first connection only.


CAUSE
=====

Dynamic definition of dependent APPC LUs is not working correctly. If two remote
APPC LUs are given the same name but defined to use different connections, the
allocate to the second APPC LU causes the initself command to be sent across the
wrong connection.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0
SP2, 3.0 SP3 and 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
