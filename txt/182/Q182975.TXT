======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

Messages sent over a connector using an X.25 stack are not delivered. Non-
delivery reports (NDRs) are returned. On the server, the application event log
shows the following:

   Events 9409
   The Microsoft MTA registry parameter is missing.  The default value
   will be used.
   For these parameters:
   Eicon X.25 result threads
   Eicon X.25 connections
   Eicon wait timeout (ms)

-AND-

   Event 9106
   An internal MTA error occurred.  The X.25 interface failed to
   initialize. Check to make sure the X.25 card is started. (14)

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, manually add the default keys using the Registry
Editor.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), and go to the following subkey:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services
      \MSEchangeMTA\Parameters

   NOTE: The above registry key is all one path; it has been wrapped for
   readability.

2. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and add the following information:

   Eicon ait timeout (MS) as REG_DWORD 0x1F4
   Eicon X.25 connections as REG_DWORD 0x14
   Eicon X.25 result threads as REG_DWORD 0x2

3. Quit Registry Editor.

4. Restart the message transfer agent (MTA).
