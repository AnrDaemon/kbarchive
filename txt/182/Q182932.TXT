TITLE   :XFOR: Directory Replication Fails over Internet Mail Service
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to perform directory replication between two Microsoft Exchange
Server computers that are connected by an Internet Mail Service, directory
replication may fail. The directory replication messages are received by the
Internet Mail Service, but directory replication does not occur.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when the directory replication messages received by the
Internet Mail Service have an address type of MSXCHNGE instead of EX. When this
happens, the Internet Mail Service may be unable to convert the address to a
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) address. The address is also not recognized
as an Exchange address. Therefore, the Internet Mail Service is unable to
deliver the message.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
