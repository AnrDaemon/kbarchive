TITLE   :BUG: ClassView Add... Errors with Read-Only Project Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbwizard kbActiveX kbCOMt kbCtrl kbide kbInprocSvr kbMFC kbVC kbVC420 kbVC500 kbVC500bu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

ClassView offers the following four options for classes on the shortcut menu:

 - Add Member Function

 - Add Member Variable

 - Add Virtual Function

 - Add Windows Message Handler

These operations fail if project source files are read-only.

The first two operations fail displaying one of the following messages:

   One or more of the files for ... are read-only.

   The implementation file for class ... cannot be found.

The last two operations listed above fail without any message or visual cue. They
may not be presented as options.

CAUSE
=====

Source file permissions are read-only, perhaps due to source control.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the source file permissions to permit write access. In a source control
environment, this may require checking out the file, or having the file's
current owner check it back in.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The .ncb file contains ClassView browser information. If it is read-only at the
time Visual C++ opens the project, ClassView is unavailable. The .clw file
contains ClassWizard information. If it is read-only at the time Visual C++
opens the project, the Add Virtual Function and Add Windows Message Handler
options are unavailable on the ClassView context menu for classes.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new MFC AppWizard (exe) project.

2. Change the file permissions to read-only for all files except the .ncb file.

3. Right-click a class in ClassView; select Add Member Function or Add Member
   Variable.

   NOTE: A message box appears, but the "Add..." dialog box does not.

4. Right-click Add Virtual Function or Add Windows Message Handler.

   NOTE: No visible response occurs.

5. Close the workspace and reopen it.

6. Right-click a class in ClassView. The Add Virtual Function and Add Windows
   Message Handler options do not appear on the context menu.
