TITLE   :Full Synchronization from WinNT PDC to LanMan Server May Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Full synchronization from a Windows NT primary domain controller (PDC) to LanMan
server may fail when there are too many machine accounts in the domain. The
LanMan server will log the following error message:

   Failed to synchronize with PDC, Event ID LMU-6086

CAUSE
=====

This is a problem in the Netlogon service.

RESOLUTION
==========


To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Delta syncs from Windows NT to LanMan will sometimes fail because of the
differences between Windows NT and LanMan security. When such a failure occurs,
LanMan will perform a full synchronization and with the above hotfix applied,
full synchronization will be successful even if there are a large number of
machine accounts in the domain.
