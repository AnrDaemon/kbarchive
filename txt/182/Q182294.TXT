TITLE   :XADM: Synchronization Fails Attempting to Modify Deleted Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to synchronize one or more folders by clicking Synchronize on
the Tools menu, and then selecting All Folders or This Folder, the folders may
not be synchronized. In addition, the following error messages may appear in the
Synchronization log located in the Deleted Items folder:

   Error synchronizing message <subject>
   [80070005-508-0-322]
   You do not have sufficient permission to perform this operation on
   this object. See the folder contact or your system administrator.

   Error synchronizing folder
   [80070005-508-0-322]
   You do not have sufficient permission to perform this operation on
   this object. See the folder contact or your system administrator.

Note: <subject> is the subject name of a message in one of the folders you
are attempting to synchronize.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when you delete a message on the Microsoft Exchange
Server computer (using an e-mail client) when the server has been configured to
use Deleted Item Retention. If the same message is modified while offline (in
the offline storage file), and then an attempt to synchronize the folder that
contains the message is made, the synchronization will fail. When Microsoft
Exchange Server attempts to update the message, it mistakenly believes the
message has not been deleted (because it is being held for Deleted Item
Retention), and attempts to modify the message. Since the message is deleted
(with respect to its presence in the folder) modifications against it fail and
the above error messages appear in the Synchronization log.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
