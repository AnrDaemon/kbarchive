TITLE   :XADM: Unable to Upgrade from Exchange Server 4.0 to 5.5
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade from Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 to Exchange Server
5.5, Setup may terminate with the following error message:

   An unexpected error has returned, the error is 0xc1060107

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Setup mishandles a return code while upgrading the
private information store.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, upgrade to Exchange Server 5.0, and then upgrade to
Exchange Server 5.5.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next service pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.




MORE INFORMATION
================

During the upgrade process, the Setup program must upgrade the public and
private information stores to a version that is compatible with Exchange Server
5.0. It is during this process that the upgrade fails.

In order to use the fix, you must copy the Server\Setup\<platform> folder
from the Exchange Server 5.5 CD-ROM to a local hard drive, copy the fix to that
folder, and then run Setup from there.
