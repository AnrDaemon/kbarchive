TITLE   :FP: FrontPage Cannot Open a Macintosh Disk-based Web
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:1.0; WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open a disk-based Web in FrontPage 97 that has been opened
by FrontPage for the Power Macintosh, you will receive the following error
message:

   The server "" timed out. The current request did not complete successfully.

   -or-

When you attempt to open a disk-based Web in FrontPage 97 that was created in
FrontPage for the Power Macintosh, you will receive this error message:

   An unexpected Web Extender error occurred on the server. Authors - please
   contact the webmaster for this server's site. Webmasters - please see the
   server's logs for more details.

NOTE: This symptom does not appear with server-based Webs or with the FrontPage
98 client.

CAUSE
=====

These error messages are displayed if you have a cross-platform (PC- compatible
and Macintosh) network, where a disk-based Web is shared on a Windows NT Server.
These errors occur because FrontPage for the Power Macintosh writes ASCII text
files that are not recognized by FrontPage 97. It writes characters to the files
located in the /_vti_cnf folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this, use one of the following methods.

Method 1: Install a Web Server
------------------------------

Install a Web server, such as Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), on the
Windows NT Server. For more information about IIS, see the following Microsoft
Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/iis/default.asp

Method 2: Upgrade the PC-compatible Computers to FrontPage 98
-------------------------------------------------------------

For more information about upgrading to FrontPage 98, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
