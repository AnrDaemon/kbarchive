TITLE   :BUG: Illegal Operation Err Using Richtext Control with Find
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp500 kbvfp500a kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you insert the Microsoft ActiveX Richtext control version 5.0 into a form,
and you set the control to point to a text file, you can read the text file
through the control box normally. However, if you add a command button that
allows you to search the contents of the text box using the Olecontrol1.Find
method, the following error message occurs:

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shutdown.

In Visual FoxPro 5.0, when you press the Details button this message appears:

   VFP caused a stack fault in module OLEAUT32.DLL at <memory address>.

In Visual FoxPro 5.0a, the following message appears:

   VFP caused an invalid page fault in module OLEAUT32.DLL at <memory
   address>.

RESOLUTION
==========

Here is a workaround to solve the problem. This code example works like the Find
method of the Microsoft RichText control. Place the following sample code in the
Click event of the command button:

      S=ALLTRIM(THISFORM.TEXT1.TEXT)&& Get string to find in richtext control
      POS=AT_C(S,ThisForm.olecontrol1.TEXT) && Find the string in richtext box
      IF (POS==0)            && not found
         WAIT WINDOW "NOT FOUND !"
      ELSE
         ls=left(ThisForm.olecontrol1.TEXT,pos-1) && Select string in richtext
         pos=lenC(ls)
         ThisForm.olecontrol1.SelStart = pos
         ThisForm.olecontrol1.SelLength = lenc(s)
      ENDIF
      ThisForm.olecontrol1.SETFOCUS

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form.

2. Add an OLE Container Control to the form that contains a Microsoft RichText
   Control version 5.0 or 6.0 and name it OLEcontrol1.

3. Right-click OLEcontrol1 to open the RichTextCtrl Properties dialog box. Using
   the "FileName: (load from)" combo box, change the File of Type to (*.txt) and
   select License.txt.

4. Add a command button to the form and place the following code in the Click
   event of the command button:

         =thisform.olecontrol1.find(thisform.text1.value,,,2)

5. Add a text box to the form.

6. Save and run the form.

7. Type in a string to search for or with the text box empty, press the command
   button and the error message appears.
