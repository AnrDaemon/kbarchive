TITLE   :XFOR: Chat Channel Created w/Double-byte Lead Character Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In any version of the Microsoft Exchange Chat Service that supports a
double-byte character set, for example, the Japanese version, you may receive
the following error message:

   An IRC-compatible channel name must begin with the number sign (#) or
   the ampersand (&).
   Do you want to make this an MIC-only channel?

NOTE: The above message will appear in the localized language.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Exchange Chat Service does not support double-byte #, &, or % as
valid leading characters as IRC channel names.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use a single-byte #, &, or % as the leading character for all IRC/IRCX
compatible channel names.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.5. Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
