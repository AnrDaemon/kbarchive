CAUSE

This problem can occur when you send a message to a mailbox that has an invalid
alternate recipient.

WORKAROUND
==========

To check for an alternate recipient, locate the mailbox to which you are sending
the message. Check properties on that mailbox. The alternate recipient
configuration is located on the Delivery Options property page.

Try sending a message to the alternate recipient's address to verify that the
address is valid.
