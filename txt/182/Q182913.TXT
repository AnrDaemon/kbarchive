-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

SNA Server Manager opens a LAN connection to the ?Manage Agent? (MngAgent)
service that is running on each active SNA Server in the SNA subdomain to
retrieve and display status information for the server. However, if SNA Server
Manager loses its LAN connection to the server and is unable to reconnect to it,
Manager will display the SNA Server status as ?Offline,? even when the SNA
Server service is actually running.

If SNA Server Manager loses its LAN session to an SNA Server, Manager attempts to
reopen the connection for another three to four minutes. After that time passes,
Manager attempts to reconnect to the SNA Server only if its local ?service
table? (maintained by the SnaBase service) indicates that the MngAgent service
is active on that server. When running on an SNA Server Windows NT client, the
SnaBase service receives this status information from its ?sponsor? SNA Server.
When running on an SNA Server, the SnaBase periodically receives status updates
from other servers in the subdomain.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To diagnose the cause of the offline status:

1. Verify the communication between Manager and the SNA Server

   If TCP/IP is being used to connect to the SNA Server, try issuing a "ping"
   command to determine if the remote SNA Server is reachable. If SNA Server is
   not reachable, there is a problem in the LAN connection, between the Manager
   computer and the SNA Server. If some other transport is being used, try to
   connect to a network resource on the server. If the connection attempt fails,
   this could be because of a LAN connection problem, or the user may not be
   authorized to connect to the server.

2. Determine whether the SNA Manage Agent service (MngAgent) is running on the
   SNA Server that appears as Offline. If this service is stopped, restart it
   and check for the presence of an <ntroot>\drwtsn32.log file, which may
   indicate that SNA Manage Agent failed abnormally. If the service is running,
   try stopping the service and restarting it.

   NOTE: See the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base that describe
   known problems that can cause a Manage Agent failure with SNA Server 3.0. If
   you run SNA Server 3.0, try upgrading to the latest SNA Server 3.0 Service
   Pack.

3. Capture the following additional diagnostic information if the problem is not
   related to the status of the Manage Agent service:

    - Capture a Microsoft Network Monitor (or Network General Sniffer(TM)) LAN
      trace of all traffic to and from the computer where SNA Manager is
      running.

    - Capture the following SNA traces from the computer running Manager:

       - SnaBase full internal trace

       - Manage Client full internal trace

   The above traces should capture the time period when the server status changes
   to the Offline status.
