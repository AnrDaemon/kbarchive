TITLE   :Postoffice Improperly Serialized When Disk 1 Not Serialized
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2,3.2a,3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.2a, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the Select CD to create a set of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
installation disks results in the creation of an improperly serialized
postoffice.

CAUSE
=====

Disk #1 of the installation set was not properly serialized using the Microsoft
Mail Post Office Serialization utility included with the Select welcome kit.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, serialize disk #1 using the Serializer program
(Serial.exe) installed on a hard disk drive from the disk. Then reinstall the
postoffice.

STATUS
======

This is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In order to serialize an MS Mail (PC) installation created from the Select CD
media, the user must install the serialization disk on a hard disk drive and
then run the program Serial.exe from that hard disk. Creation of unique and
rebuildable postoffices requires each MS Mail (PC) installation set to have a
separate, serialized disk #1.

Specific instructions on the use of the Serializer utility are contained in
Chapter 2, Exceptions to Standard Installations, of the Microsoft Select CD- ROM
Kit User's Guide, which is shipped to the user each month as a part of the
Select Update Kit. The following Caution is taken from the Select CD
documentation:

CAUTION: You must install the Serializer program on a local hard disk. Do not
install the Serializer program on a network drive or path, on a RAM drive, or a
virtual drive. Attempting to install the Serializer program on a network drive
or path will result in incorrect Serializer operation and loss of serial number
range.

for PC Networks Serializer."
