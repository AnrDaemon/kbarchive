TITLE   :XADM: Event Service Won't Start If Alternate PF Server Selected
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure a different server to be the Public Folder Server, the Event
Service fails to start and logs the following sequence of events in the Windows
NT Event Log:

   Event ID   : 0
   Source     : MSExchangeES
   Type       : Informational
   Category   : General
   Description: The Microsoft Exchange Event Service (5.5.1960.3)
                Started successfully.

   Event ID   : 5
   Source     : MSExchangeES
   Type       : Error
   Category   : General
   Description: An unexpected MAPI error occurred. Error returned
                was [0x80004005].

   Event ID   : 1
   Source     : MSExchangeES
   Type       : Informational
   Category   : General
   Description: The Microsoft Exchange Event Service stopped successfully.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by design.

When you change Server A's private store to use the public store on Server B,
this change is not complete until the DS changes have replicated from Server A
to Server B, which takes 10 to 15 minutes (or whatever the replication latency
of your site is). After that time, the Event Service should start normally.

As an alternative, you should be able to force a DS replication update in the
site to make this happen sooner.
