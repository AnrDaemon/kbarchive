TITLE   :SMS: Error in Prodspec.ini in WinNT 4.0 (KOR and CHT Versions)
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.2 SP3,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MORE INFORMATION
================

The correct version of the Prodspec.ini file will be included in the next
service pack update to Windows NT.

SYMPTOMS
========

A computer running inventory on the Korean (KOR) or Traditional Chinese (CHT)
versions of Windows NT and Systems Management Server cannot differentiate
between Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server. Specifically, the
inventory rule in the NT40srv.pdf and NT40wks.pdf files cannot tell the
difference between a computer running Windows NT Workstation 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT 4.0 includes a file named Prodspec.ini. This file is used for Systems
Management Server inventory to identify Windows NT 4.0 and differentiate between
Windows NT Server and Windows NT Workstation. However, Korean and Traditional
Chinese versions of Windows NT 4.0 include the same Prodspec.ini file
(specifically, the Windows NT Workstation 4.0 version of Prodspec.ini is used
for both). Therefore, the inventory rule in the NT40srv.pdf and NT40wks.pdf
files cannot tell the difference between a computer running Windows NT
Workstation 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Locate the Prodspec.ini file in the Smssetup\Common\<Langdir>
   directory, where <Langdir> is Korean or TChinese, depending on whether
   you are using the Korean or Traditional Chinese version of Systems Management
   Server 1.2 Service Pack 3.

2. Create a job to distribute this file to your computers running Windows NT
   Server 4.0 (using other hardware inventory data for the query). Make sure the
   file is placed in the %Winroot%\System32 directory.

At this point, the software inventory rule in the NT40srv.pdf file that comes
with Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 3 will be able to correctly
detect Korean or Traditional Chinese Windows NT Server 4.0 computers.
