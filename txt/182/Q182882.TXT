======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade Microsoft SNA Server from version 3.0 to version 4.0, you may
receive a pop-up message indicating that SNA Server cannot copy the Mfc42u.dll
file to the \WINNT\System32 directory. A dialog is then presented with the
options to Abort, Retry, or Ignore.

CAUSE
=====

This message can occur if an application, such as Microsoft Visual C++ 4.2 (or
some third-party application that has been written to use its own version of the
Mfc42u.dll file), has a lock on this file during the upgrade process.

WORKAROUND
==========

Stop any applications that may be running, and choose Retry to continue the
upgrade process.
