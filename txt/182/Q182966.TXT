TITLE   :XADM: Exchange 5.0 SP2 Upgrade Fails with No Mapping Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to upgrade to Service Pack 2 on Exchange 5.0, the upgrade fails
with the following error message:

   No mapping between account names and security IDs was done.

   Microsoft Windows NT
   ID no: 0xc0020534

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, make sure that the service account is listed on all
Exchange services instead of the system account. To check this, go to Control
Panel / Services. Double-click each service and look at the Log On As box. "This
Account" should be selected, and the Exchange service account should be entered
in this field.

The upgrade to Service Pack 2 should now complete successfully.
