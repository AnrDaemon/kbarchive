MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

After the above hotfix or Service Pack is applied, you can set the registry
parameter to override the postmaster address.

1. Specify the SMTP address identified as the postmaster by setting the
   following registry value:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS
      \ParametersSystem

   Name: System Administrator's SMTP Addr
   Type: REG_SZ

2. Set the value to the SMTP address you want to use in place of
   Postmaster@localDomain.ext.
