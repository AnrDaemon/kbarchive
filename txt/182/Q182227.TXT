TITLE   :DNS Server Does Not Check for Delegations Before Forwarding
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

DNS server does not check for delegations before forwarding to a forwarder. On a
primary DNS (DNS-main), if you delegate a subdomain to another DNS (DNS-sub),
DNS name resolution works fine. However, if you set up DNS-main to use a
forwarder (non-slave), the resolution request is sent to the Forwarder first and
may fail.

CAUSE
=====

Checking for delegated domains before sending a name resolution request to the
forwarder is new functionality added to the DNS.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
