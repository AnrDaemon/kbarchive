TITLE   :XADM: Offline Address Book Generated on Global Address List Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you generate the Offline Address Book (OAB) from the Global Address List
(GAL), it may fail with the following error message:

   Event 5012, Source MSExchangeSA,
   Description: Failed to generate offline Address Book for container: /o=
   <org> /ou=<site>/cn=<container>.
   Result: An empty table was passed to the MAPI call.

CAUSE
=====

The container specified in the error message is empty. The offline address book
generation function makes a quick scan of each container listed in the Address
Books list to verify container population. If it identifies an empty container,
it will fail.

This behavior is by design.

WORKAROUND
==========

Add a user to this container and the error will no longer be reported.
