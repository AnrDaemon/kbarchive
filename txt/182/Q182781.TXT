TITLE   :Client Connections to Multihomed Server Not Load Balanced
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT;4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You have a number of clients that are using TCP/IP to connect to a multihomed
server that has no IP addresses on the same subnet as the client and the clients
are always connecting to the same address on the server, even though the paths
to more than one of the addresses are equal.

CAUSE
=====

When the client's NetBT layer attempts to resolve the NetBIOS name to an IP
address, it queries the WINS server for the address of a multihomed server and
receives a list of addresses that are always in the same order. NetBT then takes
that list and sorts it, putting addresses on the same subnet (if any) at the
top, followed by addresses in the same network class, and then any remaining
addresses. It then starts at the top of this list and pings the first address to
make sure it is valid. If it does not get a reply, it will go on to the next
address; if it does get a reply, it will use the first address.

The problem is that, within these three categories, the order of addresses is
left unchanged from the list provided by the WINS server. This means that, as
long as the first address in the list is online, it will be the one that is
always used by every client, which does not provide for load balancing.
