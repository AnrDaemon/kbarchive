TITLE   :Admin: Snap-in Does Not Recognize the Local Machine Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Inadvertently, you can add the local computer's COMTI snap-in to Microsoft
Management Console (MMC) twice. The first time is by adding the local snap- in;
the second time is by adding the same snap-in, having first selected the local
machine name.

To demonstrate the problem, perform the following steps:

1. Start the COMTI Administration Tool; that is , start MMC with local machine
   snap-in for COMTI.

2. On the Console menu, select Add/Remove SnapIn.

3. Add COM Transaction Integrator snap-in.

4. In the Chooser dialog box, select Another Computer and type the name of the
   local computer.

You end up with two copies of the Administration snap-in, which can confuse later
updates.

STATUS
======

Integrator for CICS and IMS version 1.0. This problem was corrected in the
