TITLE   :PRB: Err: Cluster Resource Dependency Can Not Be Found
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to select the "Use Network Name as Computer Name" check box for a
resource, you may receive the following error:

   The Cluster resource dependency can not be found.

This error may be generated even if your resource depends on a resource, that in
turn depends on a network name resource.

For example, if the resource being configured above is called "A" and it depends
on a resource called "B", "B" would be the resource that depends on the network
name resource:

   A --> B --> Network Name

CAUSE
=====

An indirect dependency, such as that shown above, will not be recognized by the
Cluster Administrator.

RESOLUTION
==========

If one resource uses another, there should be a direct dependency between them.
Note that it is not necessary to add a dependency for something a resource does
not directly use. For example, extending the illustration from above:

   A --> B --> Network Name --> IP Address

B does not need a dependency on the IP Address unless it uses the IP address
directly.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
