KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the Recalculate Routing button on the Routing tab of the Site
Addressing property page in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program to
recalculate the routing on Exchange Server 5.0, the Mad.exe process may use 100
percent of the CPU.

In the Windows NT Performance Monitor, you will see that the % Processor Time for
the MAD process goes to 100 percent and does not drop from this figure even when
left for 24 hours.

CAUSE
=====

The message transfer agent (MTA) has hit a loop in the routing recalculation
code.
