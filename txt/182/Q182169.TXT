To determine whether a form field exists in a document, you can use the Exists
method. The following sample Visual Basic for Applications macro will determine
whether the form field named Text1 exists in the current or active document:

      Sub DoesFormFieldExist()
         If ActiveDocument.Bookmarks.Exists("Text1") Then
            MsgBox "The form field Text1 does exist."
         Else
            MsgBox "The form field Text1 does not exist."
         End If
      End Sub

For more information about the Exists method, click the Office Assistant while in
the Visual Basic Editor, type "Exists method" (without the quotation marks),
click Search, and then click to view "Exists method."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If the Assistant is not able to answer your query, please see
