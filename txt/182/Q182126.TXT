SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to rename your FrontPage web.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To rename your FrontPage web, follow these steps:

1. In FrontPage Explorer, open your Web.

2. On the Tools menu, click Web Settings.

3. Click the Configuration tab.

4. In the Web Name box, type the new name you want to use for your web. This
   name will become part of your Internet address. For example, if your content
   is located on a Web server called, example.microsoft.com, and the name of
   your Web is MyWeb, your Internet address will be:

   http://example.microsoft.com/MyWeb

   NOTE: If the Web Name box is not available (dimmed), the root Web is open. You
   cannot rename the Web while it is open.

5. In the Web Title box, type the title you want to use for your Web. This title
   will be used to identify your Web in FrontPage, such as when you view the
   list of Webs in the Getting Started dialog box.
