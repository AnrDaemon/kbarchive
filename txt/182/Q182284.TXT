The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word, you cannot create a cross-reference to any captions in text
boxes. These captions are not listed in the Cross-reference dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

Text boxes, such as captions for "float over text" objects, reside in the
drawing layer of the document. However, items in the drawing layer are not a
valid Reference Type in the Cross-reference dialog box.

WORKAROUND
==========

To reference the caption in the text box, convert the text box to a frame by
following these steps:

1. Click to select the text box.

2. On the Format menu, click Text Box.

3. Click the Text Box tab.

4. Click Convert to Frame, and then click OK.
