      ' FUNCTION:
      '    RunningOnMac() As Boolean
      '
      ' PURPOSE:
      '    Detects if you are running on a Macintosh computer.
      '
      ' ARGUMENTS:
      '    None
      '
      ' RETURNS:
      '    True - You are running on a Macintosh computer.

      ' **********************************************************************
      Function RunningOnMac() As Boolean

         ' Get the Operating System string.
         Dim strOs As String
         strOs = Application.OperatingSystem

         ' Check if the string Mac is part of the Os string.
         If InStr(1, strOs, "Mac", vbBinaryCompare) > 0 Then
            RunningOnMac = True
         Else
            RunningOnMac = False
         End If

      End Function

The following example shows how to use the RunningOnMac function:

      Sub main()

         ' Test if you are on a Macintosh computer.
         If RunningOnMac Then

            ' Enter Macintosh-specific code here.
            MsgBox "Running on a Macintosh"

         Else

            ' Enter Windows-specific code here.
            MsgBox "Running on Windows"
          End If

      End Sub
