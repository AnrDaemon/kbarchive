PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2,3.0 SP3,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot dynamically define invokable Advanced Program-to-Program
Communication or Common Programming Interface for Communications (APPC/CPIC)
transaction programs (TPs) on an SNA Server Windows NT client. When a new
invokable TP is defined in the registry, you must stop and restart the SnaBase
process to recognize the presence of the new TP.

NOTE: The SNA Server Windows 95 client has supported this feature since SNA
Server version 3.0.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server Windows NT client was not originally designed to support the
dynamic definition of new invokable TPs.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you apply this update, any Windows NT program may notify the SnaBase
service that a new TP has been installed on the computer by signaling the
SNABASE_NEWTP_EVENT event. When this event is signaled, SnaBase re-reads the
local registry to find the newly installed, invokable TPs.
