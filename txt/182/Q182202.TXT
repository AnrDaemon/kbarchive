TITLE   :XADM: Clean Mailbox Progress Bar Displays Incorrect Message Coun
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

During the Clean Mailbox process, the progress bar always displays 0 even though
messages are being deleted.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when the number of messages is less than 200
(approximately).

This is by product design

MORE INFORMATION
================

The progress bar displayed by the Clean Mailbox function is driven by MAPI
calls, which are only updated periodically. When less than a certain number of
messages (200+) are found, the callback either never happens or happens only
once (right before the transition to deleting messages), in which case you never
see the actual number. If you delete a larger number of messages, the status bar
will not be zero.
