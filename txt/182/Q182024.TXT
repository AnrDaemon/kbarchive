TITLE   :XFOR: Built-in WinNT System Groups Not Added to Chat Sysop
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Microsoft Management Console for the Microsoft Exchange Chat
Service to attempt to add one of the following Windows NT built-in system groups
to the Chat Sysop Managers or the Chat Sysops account, the group will appear to
be added but will not appear in the Member Name Pane. No error message will be
displayed.

   Authenticated Users
   INTERACTIVE
   NETWORK
   SYSTEM
   CREATOR OWNER

NOTE: CREATOR OWNER can only be added on a local computer.

All other Windows NT accounts and groups, both local and global, can be added
without a problem.

CAUSE
=====

These built-in accounts are not listed in the User Manager window. However, when
you administer a computer and Windows NT presents lists of groups, these special
groups sometimes appear in the list, as is the case with the Chat Service.

RESOLUTION
==========

These groups are not required as part of the Chat Service and should not be
added to either the Chat Sysop Managers account or the Chat Sysops account
through the Microsoft Management Console.
