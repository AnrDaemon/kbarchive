-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to open the Exchange Server Setup.log file in any other word-
processing application other than Notepad, the file will appear unreadable.

CAUSE
=====

The format of the Exchange Server Setup.log file was intended to be opened in
Notepad with the Fixedsys font.

WORKAROUND
==========

To make the Exchange Server Setup.log file partially readable, you can change
the font to a non-true type font (such as System or Fixedsys) by following these
steps:

1. In Wordpad (Write.exe), choose Select All from the Edit menu.

2. From the Format menu, select Font.

3. In the Font dialog box, choose the System font.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the Exchange Server Setup.log file is too large to be opened in Notepad, the
system will default to open the file in Wordpad if it is installed.

Additional query words: word boxes write.exe wordpad.exe notepad.exe
