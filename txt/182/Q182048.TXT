MORE INFORMATION
================

To install this hotfix, perform the steps below. Note that this procedure
involves editing the system registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Stop all Systems Management Server services.

2. Rename the existing Sms.exe file to Sms.old (this file will most likely be
   located in either the Sms\Site.srv\X86.bin or Sms\Site.srv\Alpha.bin
   directories).

3. Copy the new (hotfix) version of Sms.exe to the directory the existing
   Sms.exe file was located in.

4. Start the Systems Management Server Administrator program.

5. On the Tools menu, click Options.

6. Click Save Settings Now (this creates the SuppressMissingAddressDialog value
   in the AppSettings key in HKEY_CURRENT_USER in the system registry).

7. Start RegEdt32.exe.

8. Navigate to the following key:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Main\AppSettings

9. Change SuppressMissingAddressDialog value from 0 to 1.

10. Close and reopen the Systems Management Server Administrator program.
