TITLE   :WD97: Tables Appear Incomplete in File Open Preview
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word97 kbtable

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Templates and documents that contain tables may appear incomplete in the preview
area of the Open dialog box (on the File menu, click Open, and then click the
Preview button on the toolbar).

One of the following symptoms may occur:

 - The table is truncated on the left edge, right edge or the bottom.

 - The preview area appears blank.

 - A series of random table borders are displayed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the document or template has been saved with the Save
Preview Picture check box selected (on the File menu, click Properties).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, turn off the Save Preview Picture property for the
document, by following these steps:

1. On the File menu, click Properties.

2. Click to clear the Save Preview Picture check box, and then click OK.

3. Save the document.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You must set the Save Preview Picture property individually for each document.
The Save Preview Picture property is a document property, and not a global or
"sticky" property of Microsoft Word. This property is off by default.

If you set the Save Preview Picture property, Word saves a graphic image of the
first full-page in the file header. Word then shows this image in the preview
area of the Open dialog box.

If you do not set the Save Preview Picture property, Word reads the document, and
displays the upper-left corner of the document in the preview area. It takes
Word longer to do this than to display a saved preview picture.

For more information about the Save Preview Picture property, see the following
