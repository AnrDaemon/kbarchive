TITLE   :SMS: Netmon: GPF Occurs When Large String Entered in Name Field
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:smsnetmon

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A general protection (GP) fault may occur in Network Monitor if you enter a
string of 49 characters in the Name box of the "Find Network Addresses From
Name" dialog box and then run a query.

CAUSE
=====

Even though 49 characters is an excessive number for a machine name, the Name
field allows this many characters to be entered. Therefore, it should either
allow a query based on the 49 character machine name or it should generate an
error message stating that the name length is too long.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post additional
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
