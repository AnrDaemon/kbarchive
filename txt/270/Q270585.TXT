TITLE   :PC Gen: Usrdmp Utility Lists Deleted Users
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:_IK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you run the Usrdmp utility (Usrdmp.exe), the output may display both
deleted and active mailboxes.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the Listuser utility (Listuser.exe) to list the user
mailboxes instead of the Usrdmp utility. The Listuser utility only displays
active mailboxes. The Listuser utility is the replacement for the Usrdmp
utility.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
