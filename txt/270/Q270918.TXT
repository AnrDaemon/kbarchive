TITLE   :XADM: Event Service Delay in Processing Scripts
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When event server scripts are bound to folders that have a replica on other
servers, there may be a delay in the processing of these scripts. Scripts that
are installed in folders that have no replicas are processed instantaneously.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the Event service uses Incremental Change
Synchronization (ICS) notifications from the information store to process
scripts in folders. The information store provider currently obtains a list of
servers, and the ICS notification is registered against the first server in the
list. In most cases the first server in the list is not the local computer to
which the event server is connected.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, make sure that no replicas exist for the folder in
which the script is installed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.
