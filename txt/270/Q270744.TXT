======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta Language Learning French 
 - Microsoft Encarta Language Learning French Deluxe 
 - Microsoft Encarta Language Learning Spanish 
 - Microsoft Encarta Language Learning Spanish Deluxe 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you uninstall the Encarta Language Learning programs listed at the
beginning of this article, you are not prompted to save your user database file.
As a result, the user database file is deleted.

The user database file (UserDB.dat) contains all of the saved information for a
user, such as the user's name and the user's scores.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, back up your user database file before you uninstall
the Encarta Language Learning program. You can later copy this backup file into
another installation of the Encarta Language Learning program.

To back up your user database file to the Microsoft Windows desktop:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type the appropriate line for your Encarta Language Learning
   program, and then click OK

   Encarta Language Learning - French:

   "<drive>:\Program Files\Microsoft Encarta\Encarta Language Learning
   French" (without the quotation marks)

   Encarta Language Learning - Spanish:

   "<drive>:\Program Files\Microsoft Encarta\Encarta Language Learning
   Spanish" (without the quotation marks)

   where <drive> is the drive letter of the hard disk on which the Encarta
   Language Learning program is installed.

3. Right-click the UserDB.dat file in the window that appears.

4. Click Copy.

5. Close all open windows on the screen.

6. Right-click an empty area on the Windows desktop.

7. Click Paste.

NOTE: You may want to back up the UserDB.dat file to a location other then the
Windows desktop. Use these steps as a basic guideline when you back up the
UserDB.dat file to an alternate location.

STATUS
======
