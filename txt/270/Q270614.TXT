TITLE   :PRB: Exchange Server 5.5 Rejects POP3 Messages in Base64
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you submit a message that has a Base64 body part to Exchange versions 5.5 and
earlier by using Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3), and the body part contains
extraneous characters after the termination sequence, you may receive the
following error message even if the extraneous characters are otherwise valid:

   The Microsoft Exchange Server received an Internet message that could not be
   processed. To view the original message content, open the attached message.
   <<message.txt>>

CAUSE
=====

Exchange only accepts Base64 encodings that are multiples of 4 in size. The
extraneous characters cause the encoding size to not be a multiple of 4, so
Exchange rejects the encoding.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not append extra characters to the end of a Base64 sequence that is submitted
to Exchange.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
