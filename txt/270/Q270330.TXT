The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) July 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following error message appears when you access Internet Information Server
(IIS) index entries in the July 2000 MSDN Library:

   The page cannot be displayed.
   Cannot find server or DNS Error.

The IISREF.chi and IISREF.chm files contain errors that cause all index entries
to fail.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The IISREF.exe patch provides updates for these two files. Before you install
the new files, you must find the faulty IISREF.chm file on your hard drive or
install this file if it is not already there.

This file will exist locally if you performed a full installation of the July
2000 MSDN Library. It also could be there if you selected to install Platform
SDK components in a "custom" MSDN Library installation. A "typical" installation
does not install the .chm files. If you determine that the IISREF.chm file has
not been installed, follow these steps to move it to the hard drive:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Add-Remove Programs.

2. Select MSDN Library - July 2000, and click Add/Remove.

3. In MSDN Library Setup, click the Add/Remove button.

4. In the Options list, select Platform SDK Documentation.

5. Click the Change Option button.

6. In the next Options list, make sure that Web Services is selected.

7. Click OK, and then click Continue.

The next step is to replace the IISREF.chi and IISREF.chm files with newer
files:

1. Close any open instances of the MSDN Library.

2. Find the installation folder for the July 2000 MSDN Library. You can do this
   by searching your computer for IISREF.chm. The default installation folder
   is:

   .\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\MSDN\2000JUL\1033

3. Delete the IISREF.chi and IISREF.chm files in that folder.

4. Copy the updated IISREF.chi and IISREF.chm files to the same folder.

5. Reopen the MSDN Library and click the Index tab.

At this point, the MSDN Library must recreate the MSDN020.chw file, which
contains keyword information. This process takes several minutes even on fast
computers. When the process is finished, the index should appear and the
Internet Information Services (IIS) keywords should work correctly.
