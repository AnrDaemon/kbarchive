You may want to export the Outlook Web Access Server Name field. This field is
available in the Exchange Administrator program on the Advanced tab of the
mailbox properties. If you create a comma-separated values (.csv) header file
with "OWA-Server" (without quotation marks) included, the information is not
displayed in the user interface.

The schema property that corresponds to the User Interface field is
"Folder-Pathname" (without quotation marks).
