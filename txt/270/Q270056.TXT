SYMPTOMS
========

When you update a catalog to include a new directory for indexing, the newly
indexed directory's content does not appear for several hours or days. The files
are eventually indexed, but the time lapse is not acceptable.

CAUSE
=====

A significant change in Indexing Service, included with Windows 2000, is the
behavior of instant indexing by default. When originally installed, the setting
is set to index at regular intervals, but not instantly. In Index Server 2.0,
this was set to index instantly by default.

RESOLUTION
==========

To enable instant indexing, Indexing Service needs to be tuned by using the
Indexing Service snap-in. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open the Computer Management MMC.

2. Right-click Indexing Service, and then click Stop.

3. Right-click Indexing Service again, click All Tasks, and then select
   Performance Tune.

4. In the Indexing Service Usage dialog box, select Customize.

5. In Indexing Service Performance Indexing, slide the slider bar to Instant.

6. Right-click Indexing Service, and then click Start.
