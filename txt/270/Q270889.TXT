SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to manually create a site connector. In the normal
course of things, it should not be necessary to create a site connector in this
manner, but for some situations, such as creating a site connector between
member servers in untrusted domains, this method must be used.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program
(admin /r) incorrectly, serious problems may occur that may require you to
reinstall Microsoft Windows NT Server, Microsoft Exchange Server, or both.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems that result from using raw mode
incorrectly can be solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

1. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode by running admin
   /r.

2. Click the Connections container for your site.

3. On the File menu, click New Other, and then click Raw Object.

4. Select the site connector from the list.

5. Fill in the Directory Name field in the format of: site connector (Replace
   with the remote site's name).

6. Click the Set button.

7. Change the List Attributes of Type drop-down menu to "All."

8. Find the Domain-Name raw attribute. Fill out the Edit Value field as follows,
   replacing the words Organization and Site with the organization and site
   names of the remote site.

   Organization§Site§X400:c=US;a= ;p=Organization;o=Site;

   NOTE: To create the Section Sign character (§), hold down the ALT key and
   press 0167, then release the ALT key.

9. Click Set.

10. Find the Target-MTAs raw attribute. Fill out the Edit Value field as
   follows, replacing the word <server> with the remote server name:

   Server§1

11. Click Add.

12. Click OK.

13. Open the properties of the site connector object that you just created, and
   on the General tab, fill in the Display Name and Cost fields.

14. On the Address Space tab, fill in the X.400 Addressing field for the remote
   site.

15. On the Override tab, specify an account with the proper permissions in the
   remote site.

16. Repeat the process on the remote side.
