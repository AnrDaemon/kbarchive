TITLE   :Automatic Dial Settings Are Lost After You Upgrade to ISA Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2000
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbUpgrade

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a computer that is running Microsoft Windows 2000 Server with Proxy
2.0, if you upgrade to Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server, all
automatic dial settings that you previously configured is lost.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because ISA Server does not use the automatic dial
functionality from Proxy 2.0. ISA Server uses dial-up networking configurations
directly from Windows 2000.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, configure an automatic dial or demand dial connection for
ISA Server:

1. Start ISA Server Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

2. Click Policy elements, click "Dial-up entries", and then click New.

The new Dial-Up Entry user interface enables you to create a new connection or
use an existing dial-up networking connection.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
