SYMPTOMS
========

When you score the Dictation exercises in one of the Encarta Language Learning
programs listed at the beginning of this article, you may see an incorrect score
if you return to a previously scored level.

For example, the score may be 1 of 7 instead 7 of 7.

NOTE: The answers may also disappear from the answer cells in previously scored
levels.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you return to a previously scored level and the answers are still displayed
in the answer cells, use the TAB key to tab through the answer cells and then
rescore the exercise. The score is then correct.

If you return to a previously scored level and the answers are no longer
displayed in the answer cells, you must repeat the exercise.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
