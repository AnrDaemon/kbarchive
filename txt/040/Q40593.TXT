It has been reported that when the keyword "default" is misspelled,
the C/C++ compiler does not generate an error and the executable code does
not execute the "defualt" branch in any case.

This is not a problem with the C/C++ compiler. In C and C++ any name
followed by a colon (:) is a label. In a switch statement the case and
default keywords are special types of label which are used by the switch
statement. When the keyword "default" is spelled incorrectly, it is treated
as a label. You could use a goto statement to reference the label. The
switch statement, however, does not recognize it. Since a "default:" label
is not required by the switch statement, no error is (or can be) generated.

NOTE: It is not good programming practice to jump to a label that is
within a switch statement from outside the switch statement.
