SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) versions 5.1 and earlier do not support
programming in the flat model. They support only the small, medium, compact, and
large memory models. The flat model was introduced in MASM version 6.0 to
support OS/2 2.0.

The flat model is a memory model based on the Intel 80386 chip which supports
full 32-bit addressing and segments greater than 64K. For more information on
the flat model, consult the MASM 6.0 "Programmer's Guide" or Intel's "80386
Programmer's Reference Manual."
