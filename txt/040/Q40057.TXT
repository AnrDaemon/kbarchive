The following is a table of IBM Personal System/2 displays:

   Part Number  Display Type  Size         Maximum Resolution
                             (in Inches)
   ----------------------------------------------------------
   8503         Monochrome    12            640 x 480 (VGA)
   8506         Monochrome    17            848 x 1200 (PS/2 IA)
   8507         Monochrome    19           1024 x 768 (8514)
   8508         Monochrome    19           1600 x 1200 (PS/2 IA)
   8512         Color         14            640 x 480 (VGA)
   8513         Color         12            640 x 480 (VGA)
   8514         Color         16           1024 x 768 (8514)
   8604         Monochrome    15           1024 x 768 (8514)

NOTE: "Maximum Resolution" assumes the monitor is being used with a display card
of the proper capability. PS/2 Models 25 and 30 are equipped with MCGA. A
resolution of 1024 x 768 requires the IBM 8514/A display adapter. The 8506 and
8508 adapters require the IBM Personal System/2 Image Adapter/A.
