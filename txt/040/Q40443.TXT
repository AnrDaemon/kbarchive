SUMMARY
=======

Page 60 of the "Microsoft Flight Simulator" version 3.00 manual incorrectly
states that the type of aircraft is saved in a user mode. This is a
documentation error. Flight mode files do not save the type of aircraft in
version 3.00.

A summary of the information saved in a flight mode may be listed from within
Flight Simulator by pressing 1, F, 8 (Mode Report).

Saving aircraft type with a flight mode was a new feature added in Flight
Simulator version 4.00.
