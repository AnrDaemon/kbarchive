SUMMARY
=======

When Cardfile prints cards, it calculates the number of cards per page based on
the physical height of the printer page and the print height of the card plus
the character print height, using the following formula:

   Cards per page =
   Physical height / (card print height + character print height)

After Cardfile has printed this number of cards, it sends a formfeed to the
printer using the following function:

   Escape(hDC,NEWFRAME,0,(LPSTR)0,(LPSTR)0)

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are using 2 1/6-inch by 4-inch continuous-form cards, the formfeed
doesn't terminate on the upper edge of a card. It terminates at a location that
corresponds to the page height asspecified in the printer driver. None of the
current printer drivers supplied with Windows has a page height that is
appropriate for use with the continuous-form cards.
