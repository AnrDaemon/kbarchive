TITLE   :Inner Marker Beacon Does Not Beep or Light for ILS Landings
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

When using the ILS landing feature in Flight Simulator versions 3.00 and 4.00,
three marker beacons (outer, middle, and inner) are located along the approach
to the ILS runway. Each beacon should emit a tone and light an indicator on the
instrument panel when you fly in the vicinity of the beacon. However, the inner
beacon (closest to the runway) does neither.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Flight Simulator versions 3.00
and 4.00. We are researching this problem and will post new information here as
it becomes available.
