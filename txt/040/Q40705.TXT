The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22

SUMMARY
=======

In MS-DOS versions 3.30 and 3.30a, the ANSI.SYS driver can be used to reassign
some of the keys on the keyboard to perform a user-defined function. The entire
keyboard cannot be redefined. The number of keys that can be redefined is
limited by a reassignment buffer size internal to ANSI.SYS. The size of this
buffer in MS-DOS versions 3.30 and 3.30a is 200 bytes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Public-domain ANSI.SYS substitute drivers are available that provide a larger
buffer to redefine more of the keys.
