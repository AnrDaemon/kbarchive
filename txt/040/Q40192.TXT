TITLE   :Error A2105 with PUSHA and POPA Instructions
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::5.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 5.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

MASM generates the following error message if the PUSHA or POPA instructions are
used without a prior .186, .286, or .386 directive:

   A2105: Expected: instruction, directive, or label

This error does not clearly indicate exactly what the problem is. By default, the
Macro Assembler generates code for the 8086 processor, for which these
instructions have not been implemented.

Page 302 of the "Macro Assembler 5.1 Programmer's Guide" states that these
instructions are implemented only for the 80186, 80286, and 80386 processors.

If you have an 8086-based computer, you will have to push and pop the registers
individually, using PUSH and POP. If you have a 80186, 80286, or 80386-based
computer, add the appropriate directive to the code.
