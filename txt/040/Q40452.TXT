SYMPTOMS
========

When using an equate in an ifndef block, the following error is generated

   A2006: phase error between passes

CAUSE
=====

On pass 1 if the symbol is not defined, it gets defined. On pass 2 it is
defined; therefore, you get a phase error.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM versions 5.0, 5.1, and
5.1a. The problem was corrected in MASM version 6.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

When using the equate, specify a size (with WORD PTR, for example).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample code demonstrates the problem. In order to work around the
problem change

      MOV bx, SAVE

to the following

      MOV bx, WORD PTR SAVE

Sample Code:
------------

   ;Assemble options needed: none

   ifndef SAVE

   endif

   code SEGMENT
      assume cs:code

      MOV bx, SAVE

   endcode:
