SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, holding down the OPTION key causes the
Reply button to become a Reply All button. Clicking the Reply All button sends a
reply to everyone in the "To" and "Cc" lines. Users who received the message via
"Bcc" are excluded.

You can set the Reply All button to be a default, as follows:

1. From the Mail menu, choose Preferences.

   Note: If you are using Mail version 3.00, click the Other icon in the
   resulting dialog box.

2. Under For Replies, click the "Address reply to all original recipients" check
   box.

3. Click the Update button.

The Reply All button now toggles to Reply when the OPTION key is held down.
