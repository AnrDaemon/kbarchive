SUMMARY
=======

FastBlt.exe is a sample application that demonstrates how to implement the
smooth movement of a bitmap around the screen. Basically, it sets up a pair of
BitBlt() calls: one that erases the image and another that redisplays the image.
The necessary ROP codes for BitBlt() that should be used are SRCCOPY and
SRCINVERT.
