 - Microsoft Musical Instruments for the Macintosh, version 1.0

SUMMARY
=======

The rainbow-colored Apple logo on top of the System menu changes to black and
white while Musical Instruments is running.

This occurs with any application that changes the System palette. When an
application changes the palette, the Macintosh System checks to see if enough of
the standard colors are still available to render the Apple logo correctly in
color. If there are not enough standard colors available, it draws the Apple
logo in black and white.

This also occurs with other applications, such as Adobe Photoshop.
