TITLE   :PC Win: Network List Doesn't Sort Alphabetically
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

External postoffices, SNADS DGNs, and nodes for PROFS and OfficeVision are not
displayed in alphabetic order in the Network List because version 3.0 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows reads them in one at a time and adds them to the
hierarchy. Thus they are displayed in the order they were set up.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail
for Windows. This problem was corrected in version 3.2a (which includes
MSSFS.DLL version 3.2.0.4074).
