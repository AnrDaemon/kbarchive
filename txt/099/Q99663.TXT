-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Server and User Setup programs provided with Microsoft Electronic Forms
Designer assume that form users can connect to a network to run the User Setup
program, and that users can access the sample E-forms from a shared location on
the network. Some users, such as those using version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
Remote for Windows, may not be able to connect to the network to run User Setup
or to access shared E-forms.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you do not connect to the network, you can install the E-form run-time files
and sample E-forms by using the Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer disks and
following these steps:

1. Insert Disk 1 of the Electronic Forms Designer into the floppy disk drive of
   the remote machine.

2. From the Windows File Manager, run the SETUP.EXE program from the root
   directory of Disk 1. When the first dialog box appears, choose the Server
   Setup option.

3. In the third dialog box, specify the local Windows directory as the location
   for files (for example, C:\WINDOWS). Follow the prompts to complete Server
   Setup.

4. From the Windows File Manager, run the SETUP.EXE program that Server Setup
   created in the local WINDOWS\EFORMS directory. This adds form commands to
   MSMAIL.EXE and makes the local copies of the sample forms available when you
   are offline from the network.

5. To save disk space, use the Windows File Manager to remove unnecessary files
   created by Server Setup. To do this, delete the WINDOWS\RUNTIME directory
   along with all the files it contains, and delete all files in the
   WINDOWS\EFORMS directory. DO NOT delete the PHONE and ROUTE directories or
   the files they contain, because they allow you to work with the phone and
   routing forms when you are not connected to the network.

6. In step 4 above, User Setup created a SharedExtensionsDir entry in the
   MSMAIL.INI file that references the local Windows directory. If you also need
   access to forms or other Microsoft Mail extensions stored in a shared
   location, copy the custom message declarations in the SHARED.INI file into
   the [Custom Messages] section of the MSMAIL.INI file. In each declaration
   copied to MSMAIL.INI, replace <ExtsDir> with C:\WINDOWS\ and change the
   SharedExtensionsDir entry to reference the shared location on the network.

7. In step 4 above, User Setup created an entry in the Custom Commands section
   of the local MSMAIL.INI file. The entry adds a Select E-Form command to the
   Mail menu. The access key for the Select E-Form command is "S." The Microsoft
   Mail Remote client also uses "S" as the access key for the remote "Settings"
   command. You can change the access key for the Select E-Form command by
   repositioning the ampersand (&) character in the custom command
   declaration.
