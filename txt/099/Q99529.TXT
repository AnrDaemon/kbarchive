SUMMARY
=======

If your network is running Hewlett-Packard (HP) LM/X and using LAN Manager 2.1,
TCP/IP, and TCP/IP Utilities, performing a NET USE returns the MS-DOS message:

   Error 53 - The network path is not found

Specifying the full path does not correct this problem, but issuing a PING or
using NetBEUI receives an immediate response.

To correct this problem, set the SCOPE parameter on the LMU box to NULL.

Additional query words: 2.10 2.10a
