TITLE   :PC Forms: Gauge Custom Control Causes GP Fault
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,2.0,3.0,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a custom form using version 1.0 of Microsoft Electronic Forms
Designer with the Gauge Custom Control from the Professional Edition of
Microsoft Visual Basic version 2.0 for Windows, a corrupt .EXE file results.
This .EXE file experiences a general protection (GP) fault at random times in
the THREED.VBX or VBRUN.VBX file.

CAUSE
=====

This is a problem with Visual Basic, and can be attributed to the following
conditions:

 - Having a structure with substrings

 - Running a project from within Visual Basic at design time

RESOLUTION
==========

Always compile .EXE files from a clean load of the project. If you have run the
project at design time, you have to save, exit, reload the project, and then
build the .EXE file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Professional Edition of
Microsoft Visual Basic version 2.0 for Windows. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
