TITLE   :NET COPY Gives Moved Files New Directory's Permissions

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

If you are in File Manager and drag a Word or Excel file from one directory on a
LAN Manager server to another directory on the server, the file does not inherit
the permissions of the new directory. Dragging files is equivalent to doing a
NET MOVE, which moves the old permissions along with the file.

To move a file and give it the permissions of its new directory, use the NET COPY
command found on the File menu in File Manager.

Additional query words: 2.00 2.0 2.10 2.1 2.10a 2.1a 2.20 2.2
