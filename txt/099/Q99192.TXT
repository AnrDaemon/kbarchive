TITLE   :Lanabase Changes when DOS Client not In Default Directory

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

When you install a LAN Manager 2.2 Windows client for NetBEUI and TCP/IP, the
TCP/IP LANA base changes to 0 instead of 1 if you don't install an MS-DOS client
in the default directory (LANMAN.DOS). To keep this from happening, you must
either install the MS-DOS client in the default directory or manually change the
PROTOCOL.INI file.

Note: LANA = local area network adapter.


Here is a sample PROTOCOL.INI:

 [PROTMAN]
  DRIVERNAME = PROTMAN$
  DYNAMIC = YES
  PRIORITY = NETBEUI

[TCPIP_XIF]

  DRIVERNAME      = TCPIP$
  IPADDRESS0 = 130 20 7 68
  SUBNETMASK0 = 255 255 0 0
  DEFAULTGATEWAY0 =
  NBSESSIONS = 6
    ; the following two parameters added after documentation was completed
  TCPSEGMENTSIZE  = 1450
  TCPWINDOWSIZE   = 1450
  LOAD            = tcptsr[c],tinyrfc[c],emsbfr[cr]
  UNLOAD     = "unloadt /notsr[dc]"
  BINDINGS = "UBNEITP_NIF"
  LANABASE = 0

[NETBEUI_XIF]
  Drivername = netbeui$
  SESSIONS = 6
  NCBS = 12
  BINDINGS = "UBNEITP_NIF"
  LANABASE = 1

[UBNEITP_NIF]
    DriverName = UBNEI$
    AdapterType = NIUpc/EOTP
    MemoryWindow = 0xD8000
    IO_Port = 0x368
    IRQ_Level = 5
    SlotNumber = 4
    MaxRequests = 6
    MaxTransmits = 6
    ReceiveBufSize = 600
    MaxMulticast = 16
    ReceiveMethod = ReceiveLookahead
    ReceiveBuffers = 64

Additional query words: 2.20 2.2
