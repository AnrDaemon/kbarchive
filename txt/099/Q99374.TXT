SUMMARY
=======

The following problems occur when a network drive is mapped over a drive letter
reserved for use by DoubleSpace.

 - If a network drive is mapped over a host drive letter, the full- screen
   DoubleSpace maintenance program changes the LastDrive= line in the
   DBLSPACE.INI file. No error message is displayed.

 - You may receive the following error message when you choose DoubleSpace Info
   from the Tools menu in File Manager:

   DblSpace Error - There was a problem reading the information from this
   compressed drive.

 - After you mount a removable disk and use the same drive letter for the host
   drive and a network drive you can't access the network drive. (To work around
   this problem, unmount the compressed disk.)

NOTE: This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and
filenames.
