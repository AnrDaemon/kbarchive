SUMMARY
=======

Many Windows-based applications allow you to create custom paper sizes. You
cannot do this in FoxPro version 2.5 for Windows, but you can create a custom
paper size in the Windows Control Panel if the printer is a dot- matrix printer.
There is no way to set a custom paper size with a laser printer in FoxPro for
Windows.

To create a custom paper size for a dot-matrix printer, follow the steps below.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Minimize FoxPro for Windows.

2. Open Control Panel and double-click the Printers icon.

3. Select a dot-matrix printer as the default.

4. Click Setup. This box may have different options depending on the selected
   printer.

5. From the Paper size box, select User Defined Size. This will open a secondary
   dialog box, labeled "User Defined Size."

6. From this dialog box, select the appropriate paper size.

   NOTE: The paper size is given in increments of .01 inches, and any size
   outside the available range will cause an error.

7. Click OK twice, and then click Close.

8. Open FoxPro. Open the report that needs to use the user-defined paper size.
   From the Report menu, choose Page Layout. Click Print Setup, and make sure
   "User Defined Size" is in the Paper Size popup.

   NOTE: Because this paper size is set with the Windows Control Panel, it may
   affect printing from other Windows-based applications.
