The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Lotus cc:Mail includes MHSLink software that connects to the MHS host, which
then sends the messages. Within cc:Mail, the users in MHS look like another
cc:Mail Post Office. The MHS host is spawned by the cc:Mail Router, but this
makes it difficult to do asynchronous connections from that host.

Version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS (MHS Gateway) must be defined from
the cc:Mail gateway as indirect, through the host that runs the gateway. This is
because the MHS host has to create messages for every recipient going from
Microsoft Mail to cc:Mail.

Standard Message Format (SMF)
-----------------------------

The cc:Mail Gateway to MHS is Standard Message Format (SMF) 64 compliant. This
means messages can have only one recipient. If a message is sent from Microsoft
Mail to cc:Mail through MHS, addressed to multiple recipients, the routing
procedure in MHS splits the message up into the corresponding number of messages
and submits them to the cc:Mail gateway

The MHS Gateway supports SMF 70 by default, but SMF 64 can be implemented by
means of the -G64 option in the command line. The gateway setup area, under
Routes to Workgroups, Hosts or Gateways has an area where the gateway version
can be changed. This line appears only if you are installing the gateway on an
MHS version 1.21 or 1.5 host.

If you are installing the gateway on an MHS version 1.21 host, use SMF 64. If you
are installing the gateway on an MHS version 1.5 host, use SMF 70. Also use SMF
70 on a NetWare Global MHS server (this is under the SMF Gateways section).

Addressing
----------

To add user names in cc:Mail as the administrator, add the remote postoffice as
described in the cc:Mail documentation.

To add an individual user, enter the address

   " POSTOFF {NETWORK/POSTOFFICE/MAILBOX} " (without the quotation marks)

where POSTOFF is the locally defined postoffice. This allows cc:Mail to send mail
using the extended addressing format.

To send mail to an unlisted user on a defined remote postoffice, first select the
destination postoffice, and then type the full or concise extended address of
the Microsoft Mail user:

   " USER@GATEWAY " (without the quotation marks)

When the message has been received by Microsoft Mail, choose Reply and the
cc:Mail address is displayed. In the Windows client, the friendly name is
displayed. Double-click the name to display the MHS addressing.
