TITLE   :PC Win: Err Msg: Your Message File Could Not Be Opened...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If SHARE.EXE is not running with version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the
following error message may occur during the client installation or upon loading
the client:

   Your message file could not be opened. To access your message file in its
   current location, mail requires that the MS-DOS utility SHARE.EXE be run
   before Windows is started.

This error message may also be received even though SHARE may be currently
running on the workstation. This may be due to the network server not running
SHARE or an equivalent file locking scheme.

CAUSE
=====

By default, most networks account for file locking internally, thus alleviating
the need to run Share on the network server. However, some networks such as
Windows for Workgroups, LANtastic and NetWare Lite may not load SHARE or an
equivalent file locking scheme automatically.

RESOLUTION
==========

To solve this problem, verify that SHARE is indeed running on the server where
the postoffice is located. If SHARE is not loaded on the server, it must be
loaded and the workstation must be completely restarted for it to recognize the
server change.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SHARE.EXE is always required when version 3.0 Mail for Windows is used. The 3.0b
Windows client does not require SHARE if the user's .MMF file is located on the
server.
