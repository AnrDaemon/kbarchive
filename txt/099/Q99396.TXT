======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

This article lists some details to check if you are having problems updating
Microsoft LAN Manager 2.2 to run with MS-DOS 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SETVER
------

Assuming that MS-DOS 5.0 and LAN Manager have been previously installed, there
should be no problem simply updating the workstation from MS-DOS 5.0 to MS-DOS
6.0. Be sure that the SETVER command in CONFIG.SYS is from MS-DOS 6.0.

NETWKSTA.EXE
------------

There is also a newer NETWKSTA.EXE, compiled specifically to run also with MS-DOS
6.0. The file ensures that version 6.0 is valid for a workstation installation.
The description of this is recorded in LM23_1338, CSD00.024. It is not strictly
necessary to have this NETWKSTA file, as SETVER properly installed should
circumvent any problems.

NETWKSTA.???
------------

Some confusion has arisen from the supplemental diskette that ships with MS-DOS
6.0--NETWKSTA.???. This file applies only to Microsoft LAN Manager versions
2.0x, not 2.1x or 2.2x. The text of the README file is included below.

DOS6SUPP.EXE \ NET.TXT

To update LAN Manager version 2.0 Enhanced, replace your current NETWKSTA.EXE and
NETBEUI.DOS files with the new versions included with the MS-DOS 6 supplemental
disks. It's a good idea to preserve your current files by renaming them with a
different extension such as .OLD or .BAK.

1. After Setup finishes installing the Network files, rename these original
   network files to back them up:

   NETWKSTA.EXE (usually in C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG)
   NETBEUI.DOS (usually in C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTOCOL\NETBEUI)

2. Copy the new version of NETBEUI.DOS to the same drive and directory as the
   old version of the file.

3. Copy the new NETWKSTA.2XE file to the same drive and directory as the old
   NETWKSTA.EXE file. Rename the new file to NETWKSTA.EXE.

4. Restart your computer. Or, if you have not installed MS-DOS 6, run Setup now.
