SUMMARY
=======

The versions of OS/2 included with Microsoft LAN Manager versions 2.1, 2.1a, and
2.2 have slight differences. The system level was not changed (because the
kernel is still OS/2 1.30.1) but the version number was.

The file LEVEL8.xxx in the OS2\SUPPORT directory lists the three version
numbers:

   LEVEL8.004 - LAN Manager 2.1
   LEVEL8.023 - LAN Manager 2.1a
   LEVEL8.025 - LAN Manager 2.2
