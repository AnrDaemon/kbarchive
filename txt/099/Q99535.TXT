SUMMARY
=======

Entries for "field data type" in the ADMIN.TPL file must be in uppercase for
Windows clients. MS-DOS clients accept lowercase and uppercase.

Workable sets of characters for the ADMIN.TPL entry are:

   Entry 3: The Field Data Type
   MS-DOS client: {a,l,u,n,p} {A,L,U,N,P}
   Win Client: {A,L,U,N,P}

If you enter lowercase characters for the Windows client, you receive this error
message:

   A TPL file has been incorrectly modified.
   Contact your administrator.

Additional query words: 2.00 2.0 2.10 2.1 2.10a 2.1a 2.20 2.2
