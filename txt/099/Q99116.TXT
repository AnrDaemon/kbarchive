TITLE   :PC WRmt: Incorrect Sorting by Subject
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When sorting messages by Subject (using the View menu) in version 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, the RE: and FW: header prefixes are not
ignored, as they are by Microsoft Mail for Windows. This causes all replies and
forwards to be sorted together.

The sort should ignore the RE: and FW: prefixes so that messages are truly sorted
by subject.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
Remote for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
