-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform administrative functions with version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for
AppleTalk Networks, one of the following error messages may appear:

   Sorry, that name could not be added to your list of users. Please check that
   your mail server has disk space available.

   -or-

   Sorry, only the Network Manager is allowed to do that. Please ask for
   assistance.

These messages usually appear when the administrator is attempting to add or
modify a user. Disk space is also usually available.

CAUSE
=====

The workstation software is version 3.0 and the server software is version 3.1.

RESOLUTION
==========

While the Microsoft Mail 3.0 workstation has been designed to work with a
version 3.1 server, administrative functions should always be done with matching
versions of the workstation and server software.

To prevent these messages from appearing, upgrade the local workstation to
version 3.1.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.10
