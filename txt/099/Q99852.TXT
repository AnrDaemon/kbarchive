TITLE   :SMTP: Err Msg: ERROR Connect: (121) Network Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:2.1,3.0
OPER/SYS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, versions 2.1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Versions 2.1 and 3.0 of Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP may display one of the
following messages:

 - 

   ERROR connect: (121) network error

   -or-

 - 

   ERROR connection to smart host failed

   -or-

 - 

   NC_incoming: unavailable

These errors indicate that the SMTP Gateway cannot connect to the SMTP router,
also called the smarthost, which you can configure in the Administrator program
under Gateway, SMTP, Setup, as follows:

   IP address of SMTP Router:  XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX

CAUSE
=====

The error occurs if:

 - The smarthost is down.

 - The smarthost is not configured to answer SMTP calls.

 - The network between the SMTP gateway computer and the smarthost is down.

 - The TCP/IP configuration on the gateway computer is incorrect.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can test for the above conditions by trying to "telnet" to port 25 of the
SMTP router: type the number "25" (without the quotation marks) after the IP
address of your SMTP router. If this test succeeds, the gateway will run. If it
fails, you have to bring the host or network back up, or make configuration
changes as needed.

The telnet process may differ with software. Consult the telnet documentation for
a particular port connection procedure.
