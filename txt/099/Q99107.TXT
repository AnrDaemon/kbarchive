TITLE   :PC WRmt: Cannot Download Only Unread Messages
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, there is no
way to download only unread messages.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is due to a limitation of EXTERNAL.EXE from versions 3.0 and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Suppose you are running Mail Remote for Windows at work. You want to retrieve
all the messages from the postoffice and delete them from the mailbag ("Send All
and Retrieve Unread Messages").

Yet you are also running Mail Remote for Windows at home. From home, you want to
use headers ("Send All and Retrieve Selected Messages") to see if there is any
mail, read mail at home, and when you come into work the next day you would like
that mail retrieved and stored in your message store file (MMF). However,
messages you read at home are not retrieved to your office.

To get them, you must change the setup at work, get headers, mark everything for
retrieval, connect to Mail, and then change the setup back to receive all
messages. However, there is no way to ask EXTERNAL.EXE for all unread messages.
There also is no way to determine whether or not a read message already exists
in the inbox, so downloading all messages would create duplicates.
