SUMMARY
=======

Sounds may be choppy or broken if you run one of the applications listed at the
top of this article when you have Virtual Memory turned on. For sounds to play
correctly, you must turn Virtual Memory off.

If you are running System 7.x, turn off Virtual Memory as follows:

1. From the Apple menu, choose Control Panels.

2. Choose the Memory control panel.

3. In the Virtual Memory area, choose Off.

4. Close the dialog box and restart your Macintosh.

After you turn off Virtual Memory, the sounds in the program should play
correctly.

If you are using a Power Macintosh, turn Virtual Memory on, but set the value of
Virtual Memory to the lowest possible setting (i.e., on a Macintosh with 32 MB,
set the Virtual Memory to 33 MB).
