TITLE   :DoubleSpace User Interface Text Not Visible on Monochrome
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

When you run DoubleSpace on a monochrome video display screen, some text and some
highlighted screens are not viewable. For example, when you select a menu, you
may be unable to see the selected command.

WORKAROUND
==========

There is no way to directly change the default colors or the video display. To
work around this problem, use the command-line parameters instead of the
character-based user interface.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS 6.0, 6.2, and 6.22. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
