SUMMARY
=======

The "Microsoft Professional Advisor Library Reference Manual" documents many
cross-reference commands that the QuickHelp utility (QH.EXE) does not support.
To use these commands in your help file, you must develop a help viewer
application using the functions that the Microsoft Professional Advisor Library
provides.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Cross-reference commands direct the host application to perform an action when
the user selects a hotspot. The Reference manual discusses these commands on
page 19-21.

QuickHelp, distributed with most Microsoft programming language products, can
view help files, but is supports only a small subset of the cross-reference
commands. The supported commands are as follows:

   !B Back
   !P Position
   !M Mark

To use any other cross-reference command in your help file, you must develop a
help file viewing application using the Microsoft Advisor Library help engine.
