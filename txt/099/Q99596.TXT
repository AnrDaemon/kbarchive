SYMPTOMS
========

FoxBASE+/Mac will produce the following error if a user does not have read/write
privileges to the drive from where the .DBF file is being accessed and EXCLUSIVE
is set to OFF:

   File Access Denied

CAUSE
=====

FoxBASE+/Mac requires both read and write privileges to view a database file
because FoxBASE+/Mac toggles a bit in the header of the file for
network-handling purposes.

MORE INFORMATION

In other Microsoft LAN products, any database on the drive can be accessed if
read privileges are available.
