TITLE   :LAN Manager API NetUserSetInfo - Changeable Flag Options
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

This article supplements information in the Microsoft LAN Manager "Programmer's
Reference" on option flags you can change using the NetUserSetInfo() API
function call.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NetUserSetInfo() allows you to enable and disable various options, some of which
are displayed on screens shown in Net Admin->Accounts->User->Select a
User, others of which you can display only from the command line by typing:

   " net user <username>" (without the quotation marks)

Not all of the user account options shown on page 608 of the "Programmer's
Reference" can be altered through the use of LAN Manager APIs. These are the
usri1_flag bit fields you can change using NetUserSetInfo():

  UF_SCRIPT
  UF_ACCOUNTDISABLE
  UF_HOMEDIR_REQUIRED
  UF_PASSWD_NOTREQD
  UF_PASSWD_CANT_CHANGE

NOTE: You cannot change the UF_DELETE_PROHIBITED flag bit shown on page

1. (The flags list is for reference only).

In the LAN Manager PTK source file examples, the file NETUSER.C demonstrates how
to use the NetSetUserInfo() function call to enable a user account by making
changes to the UF_ACCOUNTDISABLE bit of the (usri1_flags) variable: set the
UF_ACCOUNTDISABLE bit in the usri1_flags variable to 0 (user account=ON). To
disable it, set the bit to 1 (User Account=OFF).

Code to the flag bits has this syntax:

   usri1_flags &= ~UF_ACCOUNTDISABLE     // to 0 enabling
   usri1_flags |= UF_ACCOUNTDISABLE      // to 1 disabling

You can change the other changeable bits in the usri1_flags in a similar manner,
to the extent that your user privileges allow.
