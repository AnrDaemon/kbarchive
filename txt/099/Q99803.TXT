SUMMARY
=======

MDIWinMN.exe is a sample that demonstrates how to customize the Window menu of a
multiple document interface (MDI) frame window. MDIWinMN.exe shows you how to
limit the number of listed MDI children in the Window menu to any number and how
to bring up a customized dialog box when the More Windows menu item is selected.
This sample also shows how to list all the MDI children in the Window menu
without using a More Windows menu item.

To compile MDIWinMN.exe, type NMAKE to build the sample. This sample limits the
number of MDI child windows listed in the Window menu and brings up the
customized dialog box when the More Windows menu item is selected. Type NMAKE
MENU=NOLIMIT to build the sample that lists all the the MDI children in the
Window menu without using a More Windows menu item.

You need to make the following changes in the window procedure of the MDI frame
window to customize the Window menu:

1. Specify NULL as the Window menu handle when creating the MDI client, because
   the application handles all the processing of the Window menu:

         CLIENTCREATESTRUCT ccs;
         ccs.hWindowMenu  = NULL;
         ccs.idFirstChild = IDM_FIRSTCHILD;

2. Update the Window menu using ChangeWindowMenu() when the frame window
   receives WM_INITMENUPOPUP. ChangeWindowMenu() is implemented in the sample
   code:

        case WM_INITMENUPOPUP:
             if ((HMENU)wParam == hMenuWindow)
                ChangeWindowMenu(hMenuWindow);
             break;

3. Call ProcessWindowMenu() in the default processing of WM_COMMAND received by
   the frame window. ProcessWindowMenu() is implemented in the sample code:

        case WM_COMMAND:
         {
             switch (wParam)
             {
                 :
                 :
              default:
                 if (ProcessWindowMenu(wParam))
                       return 0L;
                 else return DefFrameProc(hwnd, g_hwndMDIClient,
                                         msg, wParam, lParam);
              }
         }

ChangeWindowMenu() removes the old listing of MDI children from the Window menu.
It then enumerates the MDI child windows and adds their names to the Window menu
so the Window menu reflects the current state when shown.

ProcessWindowMenu() processes WM_COMMAND messages that result from menu
selections of MDI children in the Window menu. It also brings up a customized
dialog box when the More Windows menu item is selected.
