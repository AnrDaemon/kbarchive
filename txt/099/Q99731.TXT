SUMMARY
=======

When you install the Windows and MS-DOS 5 Upgrade over MS-DOS 3.3 or higher, the
setup program may skip the MS-DOS portion of Setup. In this case, Setup
continues to install Windows. Setup moves from Disk 1 to Disk 3 without changing
the DOS directory date.

To install the MS-DOS portion of this upgrade, you must tell Setup to install
MS-DOS only. Once MS-DOS is installed, you can run Setup again to install the
Windows upgrade.

Additional query words: 3.10 Win-DOS 5.00
