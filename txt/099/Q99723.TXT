TITLE   :Mac Srv: Large Messages Stuck in Outgoing Queue
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For Appletalk Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0a,3.0b,3.1,3.1a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0a, 3.0b, 3.1, 3.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In version 3.0a or later of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, large
messages may appear stuck in an outgoing server queue.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you are using Mail version 3.0a, upgrade to version 3.1 to correct a problem
that may cause messages larger than 64K to become stuck at the front of an
outgoing server queue. The body of a Mail message can only be 32K; therefore, if
a message is larger than 32K, an attachment is enclosed (the message body and
enclosures are packaged together into one server-to-server message).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are a few reasons why a large message may be queued up on a server
longer than desired:

 - The destination server no longer exists. Verify this by looking in the
   Chooser for the destination Mail server.

 - A problem with the network makes the destination server unreachable. Verify
   this by looking in the Chooser for the destination Mail server while sitting
   at the Mail server with the queued-up enclosure.

 - A problem with the network is not allowing a reliable network connection
   between the two Mail servers. The Mail server with the enclosure may begin
   sending the message to the destination server, but a problem with the network
   causes AppleTalk packets to get lost. If this is the case and the message is
   larger than 64K, it will be shuffled to the end of the queue and the Mail
   server will try the next message in the queue.

   NOTE: The Mail server with the enclosure will mark the destination server as
   unreachable and not try again for X minutes, where X is specified in the
   Server Settings "If undeliverable, retry sending mail every X minutes"
   option.

 - The destination server does not have enough disk space to read in this large
   message/enclosure. Increase disk space on the destination server.
