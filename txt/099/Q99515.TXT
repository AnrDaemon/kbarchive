TITLE   :FIX: F1001: typer.c, Line 911 From Concatenation in CALL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to compile a file that performs concatenation in a CALL statement
that uses alternate return values fails and Microsoft FORTRAN Powerstation
produces the following message:

   fatal error F1001: INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR
   (compiler file '@(#)typer.c:1.114', line 911)
   Contact Microsoft Product Support Services

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the code to remove the concatenation from the CALL statement that uses an
alternate return. Assign the result of the concatenation to a temporary
character variable and specify the temporary variable in the CALL statement.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN Powerstation version 1.0
for MS-DOS. This problem has been resolved with FORTRAN PowerStation maintenance
release version 1.0a for MS-DOS.

FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0 can be differentiated from the maintenance
release version 1.0a by invoking the linker. Typing "link32 | more" (without the
quotation marks) from \F32\BIN directory will show version 2.8 for FORTRAN
PowerStation version 1.0, and it will show version 1.0f for the maintenance
release version 1.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code example illustrates this problem.

Sample Code #1
--------------

   c Compile options required: none
   c

         CHARACTER*40 A,B
         CALL FHFOPN(A//B,*9050)

   9050  CONTINUE

         END

The following code example uses a temporary variable to avoid the error.

Sample Code #2
--------------

         CHARACTER*80 C
         CHARACTER*40 A,B
         C=A//B
         CALL FHFOPN(C,*9050)

   9050  CONTINUE

         END
