-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run Microsoft Diagnostics (MSD.EXE) with Windows 3.0 in 386 enhanced
mode, you receive the following message:

   Error: You have attempted to run a protected-mode application in 386 enhanced
   mode. To run the application, exit and run Windows using either the WIN /S or
   the WIN /R command.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, create an icon for MSD with the following command
line:

   " c:\dos\msd.exe /i " (without the quotation marks)

The /I switch bypasses the initial hardware (memory) detection.

Additional query words: 6.22 6.00 6.20 2.00 2.01 2.01a
