SUMMARY
=======

When you run the Musical Instruments Installer and choose to install only
QuickTime, the Installer will install QuickTime, regardless of whether the same
version of QuickTime is already installed on your hard drive.

The Musical Instruments Installer does not check for previous versions of
QuickTime and will re-write the files every time you run the installation.
