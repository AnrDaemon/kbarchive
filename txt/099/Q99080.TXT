SUMMARY
=======

When you load a saved game in Chess, if the saved game was a two-player game
(Player vs. Player), Chess may load the game as a Player vs. Computer game. This
behavior occurs because Chess defaults to Player vs. Computer mode; this mode is
not reset when a saved game is loaded.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Workaround
----------

Set up Chess as a two-player game before loading the saved game:

1. From the Game menu in Chess, click New. In the Select Players dialog box,
   click Player vs. Player and click OK.

2. Load the saved game by clicking Open from the Game menu. The game should now
   load as a two-player game.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Open or switch to Microsoft Chess.

2. From the Game menu, click New.

4. From the Game menu, click Save and save the current game.

5. From the Game menu, click Exit to close Chess.

6. Restart Chess.
