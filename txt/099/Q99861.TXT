TITLE   :PRB: Using SetCommState() to Toggle DTR/RTS for Flow Control
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

SYMPTOMS
========

When SetCommState() is used to raise the DTR and RTS lines for hardware flow
control, the first several incoming characters may be lost.

CAUSE
=====

SetCommState() calls the communications driver's setcom function, which calls
$SETCOM. $SETCOM disables interrupts from the specified port by clearing the
UART's interrupt enable register (IER). After changing the state of the UART and
the DTR and RTS lines, $SETCOM delays while interrupts from the UART are still
disabled. In Windows 3.1, this delay is approximately 200 milliseconds; in
Windows 3.0, the delay is approximately 55 milliseconds. If the DTR and RTS
lines are raised from low to high, any characters that arrive before interrupts
from the UART are enabled will be lost.

RESOLUTION
==========

SetCommState() should not be used to toggle the states of the DTR and RTS lines
for hardware flow control.

Use EscapeCommFunction() to toggle the the states of the DTR and RTS lines
because it does not delay while interrupts are disabled.
