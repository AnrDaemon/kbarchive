The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync) requestor postoffice is deleted from
the server's list of requestors after a Dir-Sync cycle has completed, and is
then added back into the list, the requestor does not process updates from the
server.

CAUSE
=====

In the first Dir-Sync cycle after requestor installation and server
registration, an Import request is assumed. The Import synchronization (sync) is
incremented to one (1). This Import sync is recorded at the requestor. The
Import sync is incremented for each Import request received from a requestor.

When the requestor is registered at the server, all syncs are initialized to
zero. When the already active requestor requests updates, the server responds
with a list of updates and also includes the Import sync, now equal to zero. The
requestor receives the updates but notices that the Import sync is less than its
recorded value and rejects the updates as old Dir-Sync mail. There are no
warnings to indicate the rejection; this is part of the fault tolerant design.

RESOLUTION
==========

The server assumes an Import request if all syncs are zero.

If the server deletes and then adds a requestor registration, then either:

 - The requestor's administrator must submit an Import request

-or-

 - The server administrator must give the requestor admin a manual resync file
   (RESYNC.GLB)

Because the server does not report any error, the requestor administrator should
note that the DIRSYNC.LOG reports zero updates received for many cycles, even
though updates have been submitted.
