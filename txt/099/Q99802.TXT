SUMMARY
=======

An application can programmatically enable and disable the Print Manager by
altering the setting of the "spooler=" field in the Windows section of WIN.ini;
the setting will be "spooler=yes" if Print Manager is enabled and "spooler=no"
if Print Manager is disabled. The GetProfileString() function can be used to
determine the current setting; WriteProfileString() can be used to change the
current setting. The WM_WININICHANGE message should be sent to all top-level
windows if changes are made to WIN.ini.

This method only works before an application starts printing. Once the printer
driver calls the OpenJob() function, GDI either will or will not execute the
spooler depending on the "spooler=" setting.

An application can monitor the number of jobs in the Print Manager queue by
processing the WM_SPOOLERSTATUS message. This could be useful to ensure there
are no print jobs in the queue before disabling Print Manager. The
WM_SPOOLERSTATUS message is sent to all top-level windows from Print Manager
whenever a job is added to or removed from the Print Manager queue. The number
of jobs remaining is in LOWORD(lParam).

NOTE: WM_SPOOLERSTATUS is for informational purposes only.

Please see the documentation for GetProfileString(), WriteProfileString(),
WM_WININICHANGE, and WM_SPOOLERSTATUS for more information about them.
