 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows 1993 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The QuicKeys dialog box contains only a Close button, instead of OK and Cancel
buttons.

This is because the QuicKeys dialog box is a direct interface with the driver,
and the driver doesn't offer the option of canceling. Choosing Close is the same
as choosing OK.

Additional query words: multimedia multi media multi-media quickkeys quick keys missing buttons
