SUMMARY
=======

When using the Extract command in VidEdit, you can only extract multiple frames
when extracting a Microsoft AVI file, DIB sequence, or Microsoft waveform
information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When using the following formats, you will only be able to extract one frame
image at a time:

   Microsoft Windows DIB
   Microsoft RIFF DIB
   PC Paintbrush
   Apple Macintosh Pict
   Truevision TGA
   Microsoft RLE DIB
   Microsoft RIFF RLE DIB

You can set a multiple selection with the set selection button, but VidEdit will
only save the first frame in your selection using these formats.

To extract multiple frames you will need to extract a DIB sequence or an AVI
file. To extract a multiframe DIB sequence or AVI file, do the following:

1. From the File menu, choose Extract.

2. From the List Files Of Type box, select DIB Sequence.

3. Choose Set Selection to select which frames to extract.

4. In the Filename box, type a filename such as XXXX0000.DIB

5. Choose OK.

The last digits will increment for each frame saved. If you only plan on
extracting up to 99 frames, you will only need two digits at the end of the
filename.
