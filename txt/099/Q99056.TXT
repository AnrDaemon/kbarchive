The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Version 1.0 of Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer includes an E-form
performance cache. The Electronic Forms Designer Setup program disables the
E-form performance cache by setting the "Maximum" entry to zero in the
MSMAIL.INI file in your Windows directory as shown below:

   [E-Form Cache]
   Maximum=0

This entry prevents E-forms from being cached as you are developing and testing
them, ensuring that you are running the current version of the E-form you're
working on, rather than a cached instance of a previous version. After finishing
development of an E-form, you can test the performance that users will
experience by turning E-form caching back on. Refer to the "Developer's Guide"
for information on configuring the E-form performance cache.
