TITLE   :RPL Workstation Login Problems with Login Scripts
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

This error message is returned when you attempt to log in on RPL workstations
and have login scripts enabled:

   RPLDISK.SYS
   Error in Server \\testsrv
   Server not responding: \\testsrv

CAUSE
=====

During the command "NET START RDR (COMPUTER_NAME) ...." you are not yet logged
on, so you do not have write permission in the LMUSER.INI file, where new
connections are stored.

RESOLUTION
==========

Put the line "saveconnections = no" in the [network] section of LANMAN.INI for
the RPL workstation. Turning this persistent connections option off lets you use
logon scripts defined for your computer name.

The workaround some users have tried is to log in twice: log in the first time to
let the remote login timeout and log in as the machine name, then log off and
log in a second time as the user. This allows you to log in and allows the log
in scripts to execute correctly, but you have to leave the initial log in alone
and not interfere by allowing the machine to log in to the LAN. The resolution
seems preferable to the workaround for this problem.
