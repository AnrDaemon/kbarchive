SUMMARY
=======

When playing the card game Golf that ships with Microsoft Entertainment Pack
volume 3, the number of games won indicated by the Record command may not be
accurate. This problem will occur if you choose the Backup command after winning
a game.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After winning a game in Golf, choosing the Backup command will erase that win
from the Records table. For example, if you currently have three wins registered
and then you win again, the Record command will now show four wins. If you
choose Backup (before starting another game) the Record table will now show
three wins. This is expected behavior because the current win is now an
uncompleted game. However, recompleting the game will not reregister the win.
(The Records table still indicates only three wins.) Choosing the Backup command
again will cause the Records table to drop to two wins. Recompleting the game
again will not reregister that win either.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Open or switch to Golf.

2. Play the game until you win.

3. From the File menu, click Record. Note the number of wins and click OK.

4. From the File menu, click Backup.

5. From the File menu, click Record. Note that the number of wins has dropped by
   one.

6. Complete the game and click Record from the File menu. Note that the number
   of wins does not reflect the latest win.
