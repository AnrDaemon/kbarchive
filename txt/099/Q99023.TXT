The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can set default text attributes for PowerPoint text objects that are neither
body objects nor title objects, so that whenever a new text object is added to
any slide in a new presentation, it will retain that set of attributes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PowerPoint 4.0 and 7.0
----------------------

Use the following steps to set text defaults:

1. Open the Blank Presentation.pot (Default.ppt in version 4.0).

2. Create a text object with the text drawing tool, add a line of text, and set
   the text attributes as desired (face, point size, color, effect, and so on).

3. Select the entire text object (NOT just the text within the object).

4. On the Format menu, click Pick Up Object Style.

5. Click the Pointer button on the Drawing toolbar. Or, press ESC to cancel the
   selection of all slide objects

6. On the Format menu, click "Apply to Object Defaults."

7. Delete the text object from the slide and save the file.

NOTE: In PowerPoint 7.0 you can also select the object and then click Colors And
Lines on the Format menu. In the Colors And Lines dialog box, click to select
the "Default for New Objects" check box.

PowerPoint 3.0
--------------

Use the following steps to set the defaults:

1. Open Default.ppt, create a text object (not a title or body object), and add
   a line of text to it.

2. With the object selected, apply the formatting, such as the font, font size,
   color, and bullet you want.

   NOTE: You can also adjust the ruler so that there is room for the bullet at
   the beginning of the line.

3. Select the text object (do not select the text inside the text object), and
   do the following:
   a. Click Pick Up Style on the toolbar.

   b. Click the Selection tool (the arrow) on the Tool Palette.

   c. Click Apply Styles on the toolbar (this applies the text frame formatting
      as a default).

   You can now delete the text object you added at the beginning of this
   procedure

4. Save Default.ppt.
