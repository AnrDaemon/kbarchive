SUMMARY
=======

The Sound Box option in Musical Instruments allows you to play different notes
in the selected instrument's voice by pointing and clicking with the mouse.
However, the Sound Box option may take a few minutes to load into memory first.

To play sounds, Musical Instruments must load the sound information into memory.
By preloading all of the information into memory before it presents you with the
Sound Box screen, Musical Instruments lets you play without a delay between
notes.
