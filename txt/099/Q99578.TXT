======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

Your system traps with an NEC Powermate 486 EISA tower with global cache turned
on, and a Madge 32-bit token ring card.

CAUSE
=====

Madge token ring card models other than 5208 (part number series 95XXX) cannot
function with the NEC CMOS global cache setting turned on. Any other Madge token
ring card model (5209, 5210, and so on) traps the system.

WORKAROUND
==========

Turn the NEC CMOS global cache off or obtain Madge token ring card model 5208.
