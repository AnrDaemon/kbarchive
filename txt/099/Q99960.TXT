TITLE   :Fault Tolerance Allows FDISKPM to Delete Mirror Partition
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========


FTSETUP shows other mirrors as being orphaned. FTAdmin shows all drives being
cracked with critical errors.

CAUSE
=====

FDISKPM does not label partitions as being mirrors, prevent you from deleting
mirror partitions, or warn you if you select a mirror partition for deletion.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you use fault tolerance, document carefully which partitions fault
tolerance chooses to be mirrors: mirror one partition at a time and make note of
which physical drive is becoming the mirror. To do this you may have to remove
the machine's case and watch the disk activity indicator.

Once a mirror is established, use FDISKPM to determine which logical drive now
has the mirror partition so that you can correlate physical devices and FDISK
drive numbers. Here is how to determine which drive has a mirror:

1. In FDISKPM select a drive which has a partition but no logical drives
   assigned.

2. Note the partition size.

3. From the Options menu, select Create Logical Drive.

4. When the "Create Logical" dialog box appears, note the maximum size available
   to the new drive. If this space is significantly less than the partition size
   you just recorded, then the difference has been used by the mirror and should
   be very close, if not identical, to the mirror partition size.
