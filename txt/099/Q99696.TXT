TITLE   :PC Forms: Sending E-Forms Via SMTP Gateway
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message created using a Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer
E-form through the Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, the message may not be
transferred as expected.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur if the -HA command-line parameter is not passed to the
SMTPGATE program.

The SMTPGATE program -HA command-line option exposes the hidden attachments
generated by the Microsoft Mail system. These attachments contain information
about Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) objects and custom message types
(WINMAIL.DAT). When this -HA parameter is not specified, the default is to
remove these attachments when the message is converted to SMTP format.

RESOLUTION
==========

Because E-forms are defined by custom message types, this information must be
present for forms to perform properly. To ensure that all message information is
transferred, you must pass the -HA parameter to the SMTPGATE program.
