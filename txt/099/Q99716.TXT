SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Mail users opening messages originating from a SMTP mail environment
may show attachment names as "ATT1," "ATT2," and so on.

The Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP generates these attachment names if the
message is coming from a foreign SMTP mail system (meaning not another Microsoft
SMTP Gateway) which adheres to the RFC 1154 standard of handling attachments.

NOTE: If the message is sent from another Microsoft Mail SMTP gateway, a
Microsoft-proprietary header field called "X-MS-Attachment:" exists, which holds
the filename of the attachment. The creation of this header is compliant with
the RFC 1154 standard.

Because the header is proprietary, other SMTP vendors will not have it as part of
the message. In this case, the SMTP Gateway creates its own attachment names as
"ATT1," " ATT2," and so on.
