TITLE   :PC WSPlus: Access Privileges Are Unavailable When Offline
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The ability to set access privileges is unavailable (grayed) when you use
version 1.0 of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows offline.

(To determine if Schedule+ is offline, select the File Menu. If Work Online is an
option, then Schedule+ is currently working offline.)

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. The ability to set access privileges requires a connection to
the CAL subdirectory of the Mail postoffice (usually in MAILDATA).

Schedule+ requires a connection to the mail server when setting privileges (and
group scheduling) and will not be available without a valid connection.
