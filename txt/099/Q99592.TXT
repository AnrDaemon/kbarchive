======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

When you install Maynard Maynstream OS/2 software on a LAN Manager 2.1 server,
several conditions arising during file system backup can affect operation and
performance. This article discusses three reported conditions and how to avoid
or alleviate them.

Systems on which these conditions have been observed consisted of:

 - Gateway 2000 486DX2/50 EISA machine with an Adaptec 174x controller running
   in enhanced mode

 - MicroNet 2 GB hard disk

 - Maynstream 16-bit ISA SCSI board

 - Maynard 5000 5 MB tape backup system

 - LAN Manager 2.1 server running HPFS386 on all volumes

MORE INFORMATION
================

Condition 1
-----------

The Maynard software reports that it cannot open certain files scattered
throughout a directory tree's subdirectories. Sometimes files that are
completely accessible from an OS/2 command prompt and that have extended
attributes (EAs) and permissions are set correctly do not get backed because an
MS-DOS/Windows machine does not understand an extended attribute and does not
read it across the net. So new EAs are created as the files are moved back to
the OS/2 server.

Resolution: Use an MS-DOS or Windows workstation to copy all of the files to
another place on the same disk that stripped the EAs.

Condition 2
-----------

A number of files are reported "Not Found on the hard drive" during the backup
verify phase. The path attached to the files is not correct, or for some reason
the Maynstream software is not reading the directories and paths properly when
it writes the files to tape.

Resolution: Create new directories, copy all files into them, then delete the old
ones.

Condition 3
-----------

While a backup or restore is running on the tape backup system, all workstations
suffer a significant performance loss. Windows freezes for numerous seconds on
all of the WFWG RC2 workstations, preventing logon to the server.

Resolution: Maynstream OS/2 uses any resources it can find, including CPU time,
but if you switch to another screen whenever it is accessing the tape drive,
workstation performance is restored.
