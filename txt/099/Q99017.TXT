The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The MS-DOS Editor and QBasic programs do not allow character wrapping on the
screen or printouts.

When you choose the Print command from the File menu in MS-DOS Editor or QBasic,
if there are more than 80 characters on a single line, those characters do not
wrap to the next line. Instead, after the 80th character, the letters are either
truncated or continue to print beyond the right edge of the page.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use a program such as Microsoft Windows Write or
another word processor that provides text formatting and printing for ASCII text
files.
