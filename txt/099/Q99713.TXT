The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, versions 2.1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP saves the From field seen in the envelope part
(RFC-821) of an incoming message to use in case the Microsoft Mail recipient
wants to reply to the message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Mail postoffice database has one From field. This causes the SMTP
gateway to choose one of the four possible SMTP From fields to save in the
postoffice database. The four possible From fields are explained in the
Background section below.

By default, the gateway saves the RFC-821 Mail From information in order to
ensure that non-delivery replies will always work properly. In most cases, this
information is the same as the RFC-822 From field. All four From fields can be
viewed in the SMTP gateway log file, SMTPGATE.LOG. You can see the RFC-821 From
field in the beginning of a message transmission, on the line that begins:

   [rx] MAIL From:...

The RFC-822 From field is recorded later in the Header lines, and looks like
this:

   Header: From:...

Background
----------

SMTP From information is covered by two RFCs: RFC-821 and RFC-822. RFC-821 keeps
From information in the Mail From field. This "gives the reverse-path which can
be used to report errors." (RFC-821 Section 3.1). RFC-822 has From information
in three fields:

 - Sender: for "notices of any problems in transport or delivery....NEVER in a
   reply." (This field is only present if its contents are different from the
   From field below.)

 - Reply-To: for replies.

 - From: for replies if no Reply-To field exists. (RFC-822 Section 4.4.4)

The four From fields can be organized into two categories: those for replies, and
those for non-delivery notices, arranged in the order they should be used.

For Replies:

 - Reply-To

 - From

For Non-Delivery Notices:

 - Sender

 - From

 - Mail From

RESOLUTION
==========

Version 3.0.9 of SMTPGATE.EXE adds a switch to give an SMTP gateway
administrator the choice of which From field to use. If you use the -F switch,
the gateway will save the From field in the RFC-822 headers, rather than in the
Mail From field. This means replies will always work properly. However, a
non-delivery notice might not work if the RFC-821 From field is different from
the RFC-822 From field.

The RFC-822 From field was chosen because if the Reply-To field is saved in the
From field, the recipient will never know who actually sent the mail. To prevent
misleading the recipient, you can use the -F switch to save the From
information.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be problem in version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail
Gateway to SMTP. This problem was corrected in version 3.0.9 of SMTPGATE.EXE. If
you do not have version 3.0.9 (or later), you can obtain the latest version from
