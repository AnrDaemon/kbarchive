SUMMARY
=======

Although it is not supported yet, you can use a LAN Manager 2.2 OS/2 workstation
to support OS/2 2.1. All you have to do is make the following change so that the
workstation does not respond that the wrong version of OS/2 is installed:

1. Use COPY CON to create the file C:\OS2VER.

2. Add this line:

   2.0=netwksta.sys

3. Close the file via F6 or ^Z.

4. Reboot.

Additional query words: 2.20 2.2
