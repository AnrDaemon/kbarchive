SUMMARY
=======

When attempting to rebuild a user's local mail file using the Mail Tools Utility
program from version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, the following
message appears:

   Rebuilding the local mail files will temporarily remove its password
   protection. The rebuilt file will inherit the password of its first user.

This message indicates that after completing the rebuild of a mail file, the
locally stored mail file has no password. The first user to sign in to Microsoft
mail whose name matches the local mail file will have his or her password
assigned to that local file.

Example:

1. Rebuild the user "User X" locally stored mail file using the Mail Tools
   Utility program.

2. After rebuilding the mail file, rename the local mail file to "User 1"
   (without the quotation marks).

3. Sign in to Mail as "User 1" at that workstation.

4. The password that was entered during the sign-in process for User 1's mail
   account will be assigned to the local mail file. User 1 can now access any of
   User X's mail that is stored locally.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is highly recommended that the Mail Tools Utility program not be distributed
to unauthorized personnel.
