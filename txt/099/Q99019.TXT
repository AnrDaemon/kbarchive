TITLE   :Undelete Err Msg: Cannot Load with UNDELETE Already Resident
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.21,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you configure Microsoft Undelete for Windows by choosing the Configure
Delete Protection command from the Options menu, it adds the following line to
the end of your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   " undelete /load " (without the quotation marks)

This occurs even if a LOADHIGH (LH) statement for UNDELETE /LOAD already appears
in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. To correct this problem, remark out (by using the REM
command) or delete the second occurrence of UNDELETE /LOAD.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have previously configured Undelete and then run MemMaker on your system
to optimize memory, or if you manually installed the LOADHIGH line in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file for UNDELETE /LOAD, the modification shown above is still
added to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file the next time Undelete is configured in Windows.
The AUTOEXEC.BAT file then contains both lines as follows:

   lh /l:[region,size] undelete /load
   undelete /load

When you restart the machine and execute the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, the following
message appears:

   Cannot load with UNDELETE already resident.

To eliminate this message, open the AUTOEXEC.BAT file in a text editor (such as
MS-DOS Editor) and remark out the second occurrence of UNDELETE /LOAD or delete
the second line entirely.

NOTE: This second instance of UNDELETE /LOAD does not occur in the AUTOEXEC.BAT
file if an Undelete command appears without the LOADHIGH (LH) specification.
