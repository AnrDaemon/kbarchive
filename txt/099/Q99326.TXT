======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Mouse settings may be lost when you quit Windows if you cannot write to the
MOUSE.INI file.

CAUSE
=====

Changes made in the Mouse dialog box of Control Panel or in Mouse Manager (for
mouse driver version 9.0) are stored in the MOUSE.INI file. If you cannot write
to this file, any new settings are lost when you quit Windows.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, check the following:

 - Run CHKDSK /F to ensure nothing is wrong with the file allocation table
   (FAT).

 - Ensure that the MOUSE.INI file is not marked as read-only.

 - Ensure that the Set Mouse= statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file is accurate
   and valid.

 - Search for multiple copies of the MOUSE.INI file. If there is a valid Set
   Mouse= statement that points to a mouse directory, rename any duplicate
   MOUSE.INI files that do not reside in that directory.

   Usually, the proper MOUSE.INI file resides in the Mouse or Ballpt
   subdirectory.
