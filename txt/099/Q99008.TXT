SUMMARY
=======

The MS-DOS 6 MEM command may display an incorrect value for Adapter RAM/ROM. On
many machines, MEM displays a table similar to the following:

   Memory Type        Total =  Used  +  Free
   ------------------------------------------

   Conventional        640K     126K     515K
   Upper               139K     111K      28K
   Adapter RAM/ROM     384K     384K       0K
   Extended (XMS)     7029K    2781K    4248K
   ------------------------------------------

   Total memory       8192K    3401K    4791K

It is not possible to have 384K Adapter RAM/ROM and a value greater than zero for
upper memory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Adapter RAM/ROM
---------------

The value specified by Adapter RAM/ROM is calculated as follows:

   1 MB (1024K) minus conventional memory, minus upper memory
   block (UMB) space

Therefore, Adapter RAM/ROM is the sum of the following:

 - Excluded UMB space

 - Memory used by BIOS and adapter cards

 - Expanded memory services (EMS) page frame(s)

However, on machines in which the amount of reported extended memory is below the
1 MB boundary (384K or less), MEM increases the value reported for Adapter
RAM/ROM so that the total memory on the system is a multiple of 1 MB.

NOTE: The amount of extended memory reported is correct.

Definitions
-----------

The upper memory area (UMA) is a range of addresses between 640K and 1 MB
(1024K). This area is also commonly called the reserved address space.

Upper memory blocks (UMBs) are areas in the UMA that EMM386.EXE has reserved for
loading device drivers and terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs high.
