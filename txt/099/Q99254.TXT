SUMMARY
=======

The Megahertz 14.4-kb modems in the new Compaq 486/C LTEs operate correctly only
when in the docking station. When in the expansion base, they do not respond to
any commands during battery or AC adapter operation, not to any commands from
RAS, Windows Terminal or MS-DOS- based terminal packages, regardless of the
power source. They work properly only when in the docking station.

Originally, this appeared to be related to power conservation, because CMOS setup
showed the modem state as OFF. However, using Powercon from MS-DOS and setting
the modem to ON did not fix the problem.

This is caused by BIOS v1.06--a bad BIOS revision on the modem itself. BIOS v1.09
CURES the problem.

You can determine the modem's BIOS revision by typing "AT %V" (without the
quotation marks) from a terminal program.
