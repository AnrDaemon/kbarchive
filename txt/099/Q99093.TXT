SUMMARY
=======

Some list boxes in the Relational Query By Example (RQBE) Expression Builder are
too narrow to completely display options that are the maximum length, for
example, ALIASNME.FIELD_NAME.

The Group By Fields list in the Group By dialog box will not display the entire
option name if the name of the table is the maximum eight characters and the
name of the field is the maximum ten characters.

This problem also occurs with the Selected Output list box in the Select Fields
dialog box and the Field Name list box in the Having dialog box.

Additional query words: FoxDos VFoxWin FoxWin RQBE INTERFACE objects partial show appear visible complete truncate cut off whole
