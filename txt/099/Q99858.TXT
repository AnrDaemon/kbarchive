SUMMARY
=======

WordPerfect Technical Support has confirmed that if you switch from the Windows
Printing System (WPS) print driver to another Hewlett- Packard (HP) Windows
printer driver within WordPerfect for Windows version 5.2, the TrueType fonts in
your current document may change.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This situation can occur when you change any Windows printer driver. WordPerfect
for Windows, as well as other Windows-based applications, maintains a table of
available fonts. When you change to another printer driver, the fonts may be
inappropriately mapped to a similar font, either a TrueType font or a
printer-resident font. This process is entirely handled by the specific
application.

For more information, call WordPerfect Laser Printing Technical Support.

WordPerfect for Windows is manufactured by WordPerfect Corporation, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this product's performance or reliability.
