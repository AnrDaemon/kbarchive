TITLE   :Running ftp from Remote Boot Workstation
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to run ftp from the LAN Manager TCP/IP Utilities from a remote boot
workstation, you get this error :

   "Network Modules Not Loaded"

even if all modules required for ftp have been loaded.

CAUSE
=====

The ftp utility needs two TSRs to be loaded before you execute it: nmtsr.exe,
sockets.exe. Run Nmtsr.exe and Sockets.exe after you configure the remoteboot
workstation with the TCP/IP protocol

Now, to run ftp you must add this line to Config.sys :

   " remdevice=c:\<lanroot>\protman\protman.dos /i:c:\<lanroot>"
   (without the quotation marks)

DO NOT insert a space in REMDEVICE. This line generates the error "Unrecognized
command in config.sys," but allows ftp to function.

You can also use the Config.sys COMMENT command to allow ftp to function without
generating an error in Config.sys. Add this entry:

   " COMMENT !
   ! c:\<lanroot>\protman\protman.dos /i:c:\<lanroot>" (without the
   quotation marks)
