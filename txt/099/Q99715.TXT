TITLE   :3COM: Err Msg: Error 2 -- Cannot Verify Logon User/Admin ID...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

3Com Mail Conversion Utilities may generate the following error message
indicating incorrect logon parameters have been used:

   ERROR 2 - CANNOT VERIFY LOGON USER/ADMIN ID
   AUTHORIZATION FAILURE

CAUSE
=====

This may be caused by using an invalid Microsoft Mail Administrator account
and/or password for the gateway. It may also be attributed to having Enhanced
Security turned on for a Microsoft Mail version 3.0 or 3.2 postoffice.

RESOLUTION
==========

The 3Com Mail Conversion Utility was made with the security level of Microsoft
Mail version 2.1; the postoffice must be returned to that level of security when
the folder conversion utilities are being used. New installations of Microsoft
Mail versions 3.0 and 3.2 have Enhanced Security turned on by default.

To return the postoffice to the security level of version 2.1, install the disk
labeled SERVER VERSION - DISK 1 and run the UPDATE.EXE utility on the
postoffice. Choose No when asked if you want Enhanced Security, and choose Yes
when asked if you want to uninstall the previously installed Enhanced Security.

The update process installs the current executables from the Install disks onto
the postoffice. If you have installed additional releases beyond the version on
your set of disks, reinstall those additional releases after running UPDATE.EXE
for the server copies of the executables. The update process does not alter your
user information or messages.
