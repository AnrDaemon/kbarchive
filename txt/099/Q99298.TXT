TITLE   :LMSFM Does Not Support Sharing Info on CD-ROM
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

LAN Manager Services for Macintosh (LMSFM) does not support sharing information
on CD-ROM with Macintosh clients.

MORE INFORMATION
================

LMSFM attempts to create a set of hidden directories in any directory tree
shared as a Macintosh volume. The set includes the ~AFP directory that is used
for storing desktop information and resource forks, and the ~I directory, which
may be used for icon and permission information. Because CD-ROM is a read-only
medium, the service cannot create these directories and the attempt to share the
volume fails. The service cannot create them on a different (read-write)
device.

If you need both Macintosh and PC connectivity to a CD-ROM, you have to share in
on an Apple Share server and run a PC Apple share protocol to allow the LAN
Manager PC users to read the drive. There are many third party solutions
available.
