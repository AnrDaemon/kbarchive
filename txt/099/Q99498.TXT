SUMMARY
=======

Quantum Technical Support has confirmed that your computer may stop responding
(hang) if you run MemMaker to optimize your computer's memory while a Quantum
Hard Card EZ driver is installed in your CONFIG.SYS file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Quantum Hard Card EZ models 42, 85, 127, and 240 use the ATDOSHC.SYS device
driver in the CONFIG.SYS file. If you run MemMaker with this device driver in
the CONFIG.SYS file, your computer may stop responding and display a blinking
cursor when MemMaker restarts your machine the first time. To correct this
problem, use a text editor to open the CONFIG.SYS file and temporarily remark
out the ATDOSHC.SYS device line as follows:

     REM DEVICE=ATDOSHC.SYS

Save this change, quit the editor, restart your computer, and then run
MEMMAKER.EXE again. After MemMaker has optimized your computer's memory, you can
remove the REM command from the ATDOSHC.SYS line in the CONFIG.SYS file.

The products included here are manufactured by Quantum, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
