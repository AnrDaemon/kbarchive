SUMMARY
=======

Consider a configuration that includes a Novell (or other) router, two net
cards, and several Windows for Workgroups workstations in each of the two
network segments. Here is how to make Windows for Workgroups workstations (or
any other Microsoft NetBIOS ones) work through the Novell router:

 - Add entries to LMHOSTS on each Microsoft node for any system that you want to
   talk to through the router.

 - Set the default gateway (DEFAULTGATEWAY0) on each workstation to the IP
   address of the "near side" of the router.

Workstations use the NetBIOS over TCP/IP interface, but NetBIOS uses broadcasts
for name claims, name resolution, and so on. This means that functions relying
on broadcasts won't work over the router unless it forwards broadcasts. The
browser is an example.

Use LMHOSTS to map NetBIOS names to IP ADDRESSES, and HOSTS to map Internet
domain names to IP ADDRESSES. TCP/IP utilities such as FTP and Telnet use
Internet domain names, and Windows for Workgroups file and print services use
NetBIOS names.
