TITLE   :3Server/2.2 Startup Fails with "Net 3054" in STARTUP.LOG
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

After installing the LAN Manager for 3Com 3Server tape, the server fails upon
boot with a "Failed Starting Server" error message, followed by a "Failed Server
Logon" error. The STARTUP.LOG file contains the message "Net 3054: A request for
memory resources could not be satisfied."

CAUSE
=====

The swapper cannot obtain memory resources to provide virtual memory.

RESOLUTION
==========

In order to gain more disk space for the swapper, you can delete the SAVE.EAS
directory tree.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To understand why this is a workable solution, consider the server ntboot
process.

In STARTUP.CMD, these lines are executed:

        @if not exist c:\lanman\addadmin.cmd goto skipadmin
        call c:\lanman\addadmin.cmd %srvname% %passwd%
        rename c:\lanman\addadmin.cmd addadmin.3cm
        :skipadmin

Note that ADDADMIN.CMD is called only once during the initial ntboot--at which
time it is renamed ADDADMIN.3CM--and skipped in subsequent reboots.

ADDADMIN.CMD uses the RESTEA.CMD file to put extended attributes on files from
the SAVE.EAS directory previously installed by the tape.

        @rem
        call c:\lanman\restea.cmd command.com
        call c:\lanman\restea.cmd os2\ansi.exe
        call c:\lanman\restea.cmd os2\append.exe
        call c:\lanman\restea.cmd os2\assign.com
        call c:\lanman\restea.cmd os2\attrib.exe
        ...etc.

RESTEA.CMD takes the file as parameter from ADDAMIN.CMD and executes this:

        @if %1.==. goto exit
        @c:\os2\eautil.exe /j c:\%1 c:\save.eas\%1 >> c:\startup.log 2>>&1
        :exit

EAUTIL.EXE is a utility that deletes or copies the extended attributes from a
data file or directory and stores them in a separate file, or copies the
extended attributes back to the original data file or directory. The /j
parameter copies the extended attributes from the holdfile (represented above as
C:\SAVE.EAS) to the filename (represented above as C:\%1).

So once the original ntboot has run through STARTUP.CMD, called ADDADMIN.CMD, and
called RESTEA.CMD on each file listed therein, there is no longer any reason to
keep the SAVE.EAS directory: the extended attributes have been applied to each
file. This means you can delete SAVE.EAS safely, providing more space for the
swapper so that it can provide virtual memory and bring up the server. .
