SUMMARY
=======

If MIDI files do not play or the sound is distorted from the Sound Blaster Pro,
the incorrect Creative Sound Blaster Pro MIDI Synthesizer driver may be
installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Creative Labs produces two versions of the Sound Blaster Pro card, the CT1330
and the CT1600. The two cards use a different MIDI chip set and require
different driver versions.

To verify which version of the card is being used, look for the numbers "1330" or
"1600" stenciled on the Sound Blaster Pro card.

To verify which version of the driver is being used, check the [Drivers] section
of the SYSTEM.INI file.

If the MIDI= line reads

   MIDI=SBPFM.DRV

the driver for the CT1330 is installed.

If the MIDI= line reads

   MIDI=SBP2FM.DRV

the driver for the CT1600 is installed.

Both drivers will indicate "Creative Sound Blaster Pro MIDI Synthesizer" in the
Drivers section in Control Panel.

Workaround
----------

If the wrong driver is in use, obtain the correct driver from Creative Labs and
install it as follows:

1. From the Drivers section of Control Panel, select the driver called Creative
   Sound Blaster Pro MIDI Synthesizer and choose Remove.

2. When prompted, choose Restart Windows.

3. From the Drivers section of Control Panel, choose Add.

4. From the list of drivers, choose Unlisted or Updated Driver.

5. When prompted, supply the path to the new driver file.

6. Choose Creative Sound Blaster Pro MIDI Synthesizer from the list of drivers.

7. When prompted, supply the appropriate port settings.

8. When prompted, choose Restart Windows.
