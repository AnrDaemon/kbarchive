======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

Over the course of 6-8 hours, the error log fills up with WORKSTATION 3100
errors (one every few minutes), then the network dies.

CAUSE
=====

NET3100 is the default error message: it is displayed when you have nothing else
to map the error to. Some possible causes:

 - There may be a physical problem on network. Check cabling, NIC cards,
   concentrators, transceivers and wiring closet.

 - Uncertified Arcnet cards may be in use.

 - A third party NetBIOS may not be sufficiently compatible with system
   software.

 - Too much stress on server.

 - Database applications may be running in an MS-DOS box under OS/2 on the
   server.

 - The group servers may have the wrong server name account.

WORKAROUND
==========

Take appropriate actions for any cause you can isolate.
