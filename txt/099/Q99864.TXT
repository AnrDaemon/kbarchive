SUMMARY
=======

The buttons in Musical Instruments appear proportionately taller on 12-inch
screens than they do on 13-inch screens. The buttons are actually the same
number of pixels high, but they look taller on a 12-inch screen because the
pixel density is lower.

Additional query words: mac multimedia multi media multi-media monitor display video larger bigger wider macmm 12 inch
