-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message if you use BRIEF with MS-DOS 6.2 on
some Gateway 2000 486 machines:

   divide by zero

After BRIEF closes, your computer is left at the MS-DOS command prompt. The next
command you issue may cause your system to stop responding (hang).

This problem commonly occurs after you press the NUMLOCK key twice. In addition,
if you run BRIEF, exit BRIEF, and then run MS-DOS Editor, pressing the NUMLOCK
key may cause the system to hang. If the system does not hang, you may be unable
to access drive A or B.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur due to the way BRIEF initializes memory. For more
information, contact Borland Technical Support or contact Gateway 2000 Technical
Support.

RESOLUTION
==========

According to an article in PC Week, a new BIOS is available from Gateway that
corrects this problem.

BRIEF is a text editor designed for programmers. BRIEF is manufactured by
Borland, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or
otherwise regarding this product's performance or reliability.
