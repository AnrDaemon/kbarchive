TITLE   :TCP/IP for Windows for Workgroups Must Load Under MS-DOS
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses available Microsoft TCP/IP support for Microsoft Windows
for Workgroups if you use a Novell network with both IPX and TCP/IP ODI drivers,
and LAN Workplace for MS-DOS to talk to a TCP/IP host.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft TCP/IP is a real-mode protocol so you must load it under MS-DOS. LAN
Manager 2.2 ships with WSOCKETS.DLL and WIN_SOCK.DLL, which provide similar APIs
for applications that use sockets under Windows.

LAN Manager 2.2 ships with an installer diskette for putting the LAN Manager
TCP/IP stack under Windows for Workgroups.


Another option is a Novell driver called ODINSUP (ODI under and NDIS up) which
allows transports written to NDIS (NDIS UP) to talk with ODI drivers (ODI
under). You use the Multiple Link Interface Driver (MLID) from Novell , the Link
Support Layer (LSL), and the ODINSUP shim, which translates NDIS to ODI. (NOTE:
the MLID + LSL is roughly equivalent to Microsoft's NDIS drivers.)
