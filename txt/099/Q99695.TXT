SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Mail for Windows spell checker uses a custom dictionary file. If
words are added through the user interface while another word is in the
Suggested field, the spell checker may appear to be changing words without
prompting the user for confirmation.


CAUSE
=====

The custom dictionary is a text file and by default is named CUSTOM.DIC. The
file consists of special or unique words that were not found by the spell check
process in the main dictionary. The user may choose to add these words to the
custom dictionary file. The added words are arranged within the custom
dictionary file one word per line.

If words are added with another word in the Suggested field, the original word
may be replaced with the suggested word. The result would be two words per line
within the custom dictionary file. If this happens, the spell checker will
replace the first word on the line with the second word and will not prompt the
user. For example, suppose the CUSTOM.DIC file contains the following entry:

   manman madman

Any time the spell checker encounters the first entry "manman," it would be
changed to "madman" without prompting the user for confirmation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the problem, use a text editor to edit the custom dictionary and
remove the second word on the line.
