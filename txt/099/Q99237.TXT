The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows 1993 edition 
 - Microsoft Multimedia Viewer, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

QuicKeys is an application-independent search tool that allows you to select
text or phrases within an application and search Bookshelf with defined
keystrokes. As an installable driver, QuicKeys is continually monitoring the
keyboard for a potential accelerator key combination. QuicKeys has no way of
determining if the accelerator is for Bookshelf or the application.

If a QuicKey combination matches an accelerator defined in another application,
QuicKeys will intercept the keystrokes before the application. As a result,
Bookshelf will load with Index or Find set to the defined book.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid accelerator conflicts, define QuicKeys with two or more of the
following accelerator keys: CTRL, SHIFT, and ALT.
