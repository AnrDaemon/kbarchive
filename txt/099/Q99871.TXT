SUMMARY
=======

The form of operator new that takes a parameter of type "void *" was added in
the March '93 ANSI C++ draft document, as Section 17.1.1.3. As such, it is not
supported by the Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK) compiler.

This feature may be added to a future Microsoft C/C++ compiler; however, there
are certain considerations. If this addition is made to NEW.H, then every C++
program that includes NEW.H in more than one module will receive multiple
definition errors. Either the definition must be declared in the CRT or declared
INLINE. Furthermore, because the user should be able to replace the definition
of "operator new", the definition must be replaced in the C Run-Time library
(CRT) to ensure that it is not inlined into some modules, which would prevent it
from being user-replaced.

NOTE: This change was made Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, version 4.0.
