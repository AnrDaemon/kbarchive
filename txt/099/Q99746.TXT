-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using 4DOS as your command interpreter and your AUTOEXEC.BAT file is
not in the root directory, MS-DOS 6 or 6.2 Upgrade Setup cannot find
AUTOEXEC.BAT. Setup can find your AUTOEXEC.BAT file only if it is located in
your root directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, move your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to the root directory
before you install MS-DOS 6 Upgrade. If you have already upgraded to MS-DOS 6,
edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file (created by Setup) in the root directory and add the
information from your old AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
