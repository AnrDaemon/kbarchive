The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

When troubleshooting problems with Microsoft CD products, you may have to
restart your machine using your MS-DOS startup disks (that is, perform a "clean
boot"). This procedure helps eliminate possible conflicts with third-party
device drivers and other terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs. This
article discusses performing this procedure with a CD-ROM drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When performing a "clean boot", you may need to retain access to the computer's
CD-ROM drive. The following lines must be retained in the computer's system
files:

REQUIRED
--------

   AUTOEXEC.BAT File
   -----------------
   <drive>:\<path>\mscdex.exe <switches>

   CONFIG.SYS File
   ---------------

   device=<drive>:\<path>\<cd-rom driver> <switches>

where <drive> represents the drive letter that contains the file,
<path> represents the path to the file, <cd-rom driver> represents
the filename of the CD-ROM driver and <switches> represents any relevant
software switches required by the device.

MAY BE REQUIRED
---------------

   CONFIG.SYS File
   ---------------

   device=<drive>:\<path>\setver.exe

where <drive> represents the drive letter that contains the file and
<path> represents the path to the file. This line will be needed if the
version of Microsoft CD-ROM Extensions (MSCDEX) was written for an earlier
version of MS-DOS than is currently installed on the system.

   device=<drive>:\<path>\smartdrv.exe /double_buffer

where <drive> represents the drive letter that contains the file and
<path> represents the path to the file. Some older CD-ROM drives require
this entry for Windows to access the drive. For additional information about
this entry, query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   troubleshooting and smartdrive and cd-rom abd emm386.exe and noems

In addition, some CD-ROM drives (such a some from Creative Labs) require a batch
file to be run at MS-DOS that will install additional switches required for the
MSCDEX.
