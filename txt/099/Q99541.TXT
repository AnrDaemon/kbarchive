The contents of a memo field can be exported to a text file without using
an XCMD.

The following code example exports data in a memo field to a text file
called Memo.txt from the Video.dbf database file in the FoxBase2.01:Sample
subfolder:

      USE Video
      GO TOP
      SET PRINTER TO Memo.txt
      SET PRINT ON
         DO WHILE !EOF()
            ? DESCRIPT
            ? ""
            SKIP
         ENDDO
      SET PRINT OFF
      SET PRINTER TO

This code also exports the record number of the contents of each memo.
Issuing a "SET TALK OFF" command at the beginning of the code snippet turns
this feature off. The text file can then be viewed in applications such as
Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel.
