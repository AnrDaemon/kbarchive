TITLE   :NWLink--Network Numbers, and "Seeing" Netware File

SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how NWLink determines or assigns network numbers, and how
to tell if NT using SQL Server can "see" a NetWare file server.

NETWORK NUMBERS
---------------

When NWLink loads, it sends out a routing information protocol (RIP) request for
a network number to be used for addressing at the IPX level. NetWare servers
respond with a RIP packet containing the network number of the local network. If
there is no RIP response, NWLink uses 0 for the network number and says the IPX
packet is for the local subnet. This is perfectly OK.

"SEEING" A NETWARE FILE SERVER
------------------------------

The SQL Server for NT supplies a DLL that talks to SPX (and IPX) Windows sockets.
When SQL Server is started with this DLL as the interface to the transport, it
sends out a service advertising protocol (SAP) packet by means of the IPX
interface. The SAP gets picked up by a NetWare file server and put in the
bindery.

The MS-DOS/Windows client SPX netlib can then use standard NetWare API calls (for
example, ScanBinderyObject()) to get a list of servers, which includes the SQL
Server for NT. An SPX session can then be made from the MS-DOS/Windows client to
the SQL Server on NT, which is listening on an SPX socket.
