SUMMARY
=======

Sometimes, attempting to connect to a file server with user level security with
a basic boot disk returns the message: "Connection Refused or Syntax Error".

MORE INFORMATION
================

Here is how to remove this condition:

1. Create a boot disk.

Format a floppy disk with system on it. Run ndisk/f from your ninstall directory
to create a basic bootdisk. The server copies all the necessary files to the
floppy disk

1. Use the disk you just created to boot your workstation.

2. After boot up, net start your workstation. Type: "net start wksname" (without
   the quotation marks) [enter]. Wksname can be your user id.

NOTE: If your user id has user or admin. rights and a password, you must put an
asterisk with your net use. If you don't, you get the error: Connection refused
or syntax error.

1. Type: "Net use k: \\srvname\sharename *" (without the quotation marks)
   [enter].

This prompts you for a password.

1. If you don't have a password for the wksname you put in, you are logged in
   with the privileges assigned to that account.

2. If your user id doesn't have a password, and you delete or disable your guest
   account, you get the error: access denied.

Here is an example of autoexec.bat:

@echo off
set path=\LANMAN\basic
c:\LANMAN\drivers\protocol\netbeui\netbeui.exe
c:\LANMAN\basic\netbind
net start workstation admin
net use k: \\server1\c$ *
