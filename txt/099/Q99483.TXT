TITLE   :Identical Cards on Server Cause SYS0052 Duplicate Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

If you configure two identical network cards (for example, 3Com EtherLink II/TP
cards) on a server and try to run NetBEUI and XNS on each, starting the
workstation service results in a SYS0052 error message: a duplicate name exists
on the network. Bind one protocol on each card to resolve the conflict.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error is expected behavior. When the second card attempts to register its
NetBIOS names, they conflict with the names registered on the first card. Under
NetBIOS, each card in a logical network must be registered with a unique name.

NetBEUI and XNS represent different logical networks, and you cannot bind the
same protocol to two cards attached to the same physical network or to networks
that are bridged together.

Bind one protocol to each card (for example, XNS on the first, and NetBEUI on the
second) to resolve the conflict.
