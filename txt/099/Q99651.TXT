TITLE   :Err Msg: DBLSPACE.BIN Cannot Be Loaded from Your CONFIG.SYS...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

If you place a DEVICE=C:\DBLSPACE.BIN statement in your CONFIG.SYS file, you
receive the following error message:

   DBLSPACE.BIN cannot be loaded from your CONFIG.SYS file

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the DEVICE= statement.

You do not need to place a DEVICE statement for DBLSPACE.BIN in your CONFIG.SYS
file; DBLSPACE.BIN loads automatically if MS-DOS finds a valid compressed volume
file (CVF) and a DBLSPACE.INI file.


Additional query words: 6.00 double space dblspace
