SUMMARY
=======

Sometimes when you are running Windows 3.1 in standard mode on top of LAN
Manager and you try to start an MS-DOS box, the screen switches to black, then
back to Windows, then displays this dialog box:

   The Switch has been Prevented
   Cannot Start Application

Exiting Windows and restarting can clear this problem, or you can fix it by
finding the NonWindowsApp header of your SYSTEM.INI and inserting the following
line:

      TaskSwitchInt6f=OFF

Additional query words: 2.00 2.0 2.10 2.1 2.10a 2.1a 2.20 2.2
