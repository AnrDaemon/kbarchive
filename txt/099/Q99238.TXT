SUMMARY
=======

Atlas maps in Encarta might print incorrectly to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet
550C printer, if you are using version 3.0 or 3.1 of the HP 550C printer driver
and you have VGA selected for your video driver.

This problem has not been reproduced in Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you copy and paste the image into another application and print from there,
the output will be correct. Changing the video driver choice may also correct
the problem. The problem apparently occurs only with the Windows VGA.DRV and
version 3.0 or 3.1 of this printer driver.
