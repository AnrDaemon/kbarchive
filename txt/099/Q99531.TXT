TITLE   :Adjusting PRINTSTA Parameters Speeds Network Printing

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

You can set several parameters from the command line to speed up networked
printings on MS-DOS workstations when PRINTSTA is loaded. Type "PRINTSTA"
(without the quotation marks) at the command line to see which parameters it is
currently using, or "PRINTSTA /?" (without the quotation marks) for a brief
description of each.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The parameters most useful for speeding up printing are:

 - /T (set this to 1)

 - buffers (set this to 1024 [default = 128])

 - /i (you can assign whatever value you want to this, but setting it too high
   can cause problems. If you change it and problems develop, look to it first
   as a probable cause.)

Giving your protocol stack more NCBs seems to help. You need at least 8 for the
stack to function properly, 12 is better, and if a lot of people are trying to
connect at the same time you may want even more.

Additional query words: 2.00 2.0 2.10 2.1 2.10a 2.1a 2.20 2.2
