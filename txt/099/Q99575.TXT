TITLE   :FIX: Phar Lap err 58 Running MASM From Read-Only Drive
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::6.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 6.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to run the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.1 fails and
MASM generates the following message:

   Phar Lap err 58: Can't create VM swap file of size 0 in directory

This error does not occur when MASM runs in an MS-DOS window in Microsoft
Windows.

CAUSE
=====

MASM is installed on a read-only drive, possibly a network drive. The error
occurs because the DOSXNT DOS extender attempts to create a virtual memory swap
file on the drive DOSXNT runs from when the operating system does not support
virtual memory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, you can run DOSXNT on a read/write drive listed in
your PATH MS-DOS environment variable. In addition, you can specify one of the
following two environment variable settings to prevent DOSXNT from attempting to
create a swap file on the read-only network drive:

 - Set the DOSX environment variable to prevent DOSXNT from using any virtual
   memory. Edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to include the following:

   set dosx=-novm

 - Set the DOSX environment variable to specify where DOSXNT creates the virtual
   memory swap file. Edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to include the following:

   set dosx=-swapdir <path>

   where <path> specifies the drive and directory on which to create the
   temporary swap file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 6.1. This problem
was corrected in MASM version 6.1a.
