SUMMARY
=======

In the Relational Query By Example (RQBE) Expression Builder, no additional
functions can be added to the Functions drop-down list box in the Select Fields
dialog box. (To open the Select Fields dialog box, choose Fields from the RQBE
menu.)

This behavior is by product design. If you want to use an expression that is not
available in the Functions list box, you must type it in the text box under the
Functions list box.

Additional query words: VFoxWin FoxWin 2.50 edit region
