SUMMARY
=======

The PRTSC.EXE utility is a terminate-and-stay resident (TSR) program used to
flush the print spooler when an application has failed to send an end-of-job
signal. After executing PRTSC.EXE, you flush the spooler by pressing
CTRL+ALT+PRINT SCREEN.

Like any TSR, PRTSC.EXE must be loaded before the NET START workstation and LOAD
NetBEUI commands; if it isn't, the NET STOP workstation command does not work
properly. If you sometimes need to stop your workstation in the course of your
work, do not install PRTSC.EXE as a service (as the "Microsoft LAN Manager
Installation and Configuration Guide," suggests on page 96).

Some shareware utilities such as Mark and Release let you load TSRs after NET
START WORKSTATION and release them before stopping the workstation.
