TITLE   :BUG: RC /fe Switch Does Not Work
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Specifying the /fe filename does not create a new executable file with the
specified filename. The Resource Compiler (RC) doesn't return an error message
indicating there is a problem. For example, when you specify GENERIC.EXE to be
renamed to BLAND.EXE with the following command line

      RC /fe BLAND.EXE GENERIC.RC GENERIC.EXE

BLAND.EXE is not created. Furthermore, the Resource Compiler doesn't tell you
that it encountered any problems.

CAUSE
=====

This is a bug in the resource compiler. The Resource Compiler code overwrites
the new filename with the filename given as the last parameter.

RESOLUTION
==========

To rename the executable to a filename different from the resource filename, use
the RENAME command from the MS-DOS command prompt.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Resource Compiler in the
Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
