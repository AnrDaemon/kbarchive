SUMMARY
=======

The NETCON program sample demonstrates how to create a dynamic-link library
(DLL) that will extend the File Manager application in Microsoft Windows
versions 3.1 and later. The program sample exports a function called
FMExtensionProc(), which File Manager sends messages to during its
initialization. NETCON adds a Quick Connect menu to File Manager (in Windows for
Workgroups, NETCON adds a toolbar button and a help string to be displayed in
the status bar when the toolbar button is selected). When the Quick Connect menu
item is selected, NECON.DLL brings up a Connect Network Drive dialog box. The
program uses the following network application programming interface (API),
which must be supported by the network that Windows is running on:

 - WNetAddConnection()

 - WNetGetConnection()

NETCON also maintains the MRU_Files section of WIN.INI in the exact manner that
Windows for Workgroups does. Unlike the Connect Network Drive dialog box that
comes with Windows for Workgroups, this dialog box does not browse for available
drives during initialization, and therefore startup time may be significantly
faster.
