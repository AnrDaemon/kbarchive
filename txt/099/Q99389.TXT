KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbResourceEd kbVC kbVC100bug kbVC150bug kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The App Studio, used with:
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows* use 1699 1.0 
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to build resources in App Studio fails and App Studio generates the
following message:

   error RW2002: File not found

CAUSE
=====

If a bitmap, cursor, or icon has an identifier longer than 23 characters, App
Studio incorrectly generates the resource file. As the identifier grows beyond
23 characters, it eliminates spaces between the identifier and the resource
statement. Eventually, the identifier displaces the resource statement to the
right. If the identifier is long enough, it eliminates spaces between the
resource statement and the memory option.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in App Studio version 1.0 for
Windows and App Studio version 1.1 (32-bit). This problem was corrected in
Visual C++ 32-bit Edition version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

App Studio generates a line like the following for the
IDB_THISISAVERYLONGIDENTIFIER identifier:

   IDB_THISISAVERYLONGIDENTIFIERBITMAPDISCARDABLE "filename.bmp"

It should generate the following:

   IDB_THISISAVERYLONGIDENTIFIER BITMAP DISCARDABLE "filename.bmp"
