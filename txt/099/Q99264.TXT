The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows 1993 edition

SUMMARY
=======

When you are using Bookshelf, a small (approximately 25-pixels high) scrolling
region may appear at the bottom of your Bookshelf window. This extra scrolling
region displays a second copy of the title graphic.

This problem only occurs the first time a graphic is displayed. The extraneous
scrolling region appears on each title screen as well as on the "books" screen.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Multimedia Viewer
version 2.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
as it becomes available.
