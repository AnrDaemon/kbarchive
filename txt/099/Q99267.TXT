The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows 1993 edition 
 - Microsoft Multimedia Viewer, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To be valid, a QuicKeys entry must include either the CTRL or ALT key. However,
if you do not include either CTRL or ALT in the key combination you type, the
QuicKeys dialog box accepts your invalid entry by automatically adding CTRL to
the key combination you typed.

Steps to Reproduce Situation
----------------------------

1. Open the QuicKeys dialog box and select an edit box.

2. Type "CTRL+SHIFT+0" (without the quotation marks). The QuicKeys entry is set
   to CTRL+SHIFT+0.

3. Press SHIFT+9 (an invalid entry). The QuicKeys entry is changed to
   CTRL+SHIFT+9.
