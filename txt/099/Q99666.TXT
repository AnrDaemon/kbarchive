SUMMARY
=======

The Gateway Name Utility, also referred to as GNU, allows a Network Manager to
import gateway recipients into versions 3.0 and 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for
AppleTalk Networks' server.

Many companies have gateways that can address many thousands of users. Because
the information can change rapidly regarding the recipients, many companies need
a way to easily import the names without having to retype or update users.

GNU allows the Network Manager to take a text file containing information about
users and automatically insert that data into the mail server. Any added users
will be processed as Gateway Recipients by the mail server.

The Gateway Name utility is not an official Microsoft product. There is very
limited support available to customers who use it. Product Support Services will
attempt to answer any functional questions regarding the utility; however, full
support, including bug fixes, will not be addressed.
