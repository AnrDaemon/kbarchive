======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message is displayed during the user authentication phase of
the remote login process:

   Error 642: The name already exists on the network.

CAUSE
=====

This error message is usually generated when both the Remote Access Service
(RAS) client and server are already connected via a local area network (LAN).
When you try to log on to the network via RAS, the network discovers that your
computer name is already registered on the LAN.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two ways to work around this error message. The first and recommended
way is to disconnect your LAN cabling before using RAS. The second is to
reconfigure the RAS server security access to "This computer only." (You can
change the security access from the Network option in Control Panel.) Although
the second method enables you to connect via RAS, it is not recommended because
you will create multiple paths to the RAS server. This does not ensure network
session stability.
