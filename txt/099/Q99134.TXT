SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to use the Dialog Editor provided with version 3.1 of the Microsoft
Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) fails and an application error occurs
under either of the following circumstances:

 - Choose Order/Group from the Arrange menu when the dialog box contains two or
   more controls, one control is a static text control, and the title of the
   text control is 256 characters long (the limit). (Setting a 256 character
   title may also generate a general protection [GP] fault.)

 - In test mode, enter more than 175 characters into a multiline edit control,
   then press BACKSPACE. A GP fault also occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========

Avoid using long names (more than 255 characters) for a static text control and
use the test mode carefully when the dialog box contains a multiline edit
control.
