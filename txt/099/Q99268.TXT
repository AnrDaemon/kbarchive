TITLE   :FDirSync: Err Msg: Error [158] Requestor Not Registered
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Foreign DirSync, Directory Synchronization with Foreign Mail Systems,
message comes into the DirSync directory server, these error messages may
appear:

In DIRSYNC.LOG:

   "3/23/93 11:00:03 | Error [158] Requestor not registered :
   PCM:"

   -or-

   "3/23/93 11:05:03 | Error [158] Requestor not registered :
   PCM:NETWORK/POSTOFFICE"

In ADMIN's Mailbox:

   "Requestor not registered :
   From: NETWORK/POSTOFFICE/USERID"

CAUSE
=====

If the NETWORK/POSTOFFICE are a foreign DirSync postoffice, one of the following
may cause the error:

 - The NETWORK/POSTOFFICE was not defined on the directory server using
   ADMIN:CONFIG:DIR-SYNC:SERVER:REQUESTORS:CREATE. Without this, the directory
   server does not accept requests from a requestor.

 - The REQNAME field in the DirSync message has a typo for the
   NETWORK/POSTOFFICE name or the directory server has a typo defined for the
   FFAPI gateway postoffice.

 - The REQNAME field does not contain a NETWORK/POSTOFFICE. For example:

   REQNAME=PCM:

The Directory Synchronization with Foreign Mail Systems Manual does not clearly
explain the need for the network and postoffice name for Microsoft Mail Software
Development Kit (FFAPI)-based gateways. Other gateways require only an entry
containing one of the predefined types. These types are listed in the "Foreign
DirSync" manual.
