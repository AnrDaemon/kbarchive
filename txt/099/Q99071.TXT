SYMPTOMS
========

When you copy files to a RAMDrive, you may receive the following error message:

   Cannot make directory entry - <filename>

where <filename> is the name of a file you are attempting to copy.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when the number of files copied to the root directory of the
RAMDrive exceeds the preset limit.

If no value is specified on the RAMDRIVE.SYS command line in the CONFIG.SYS file,
the default number of entries is 64.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this situation, do the following:

 - Create a subdirectory on the RAMDrive and copy your files to the
   subdirectory.

-or-

 - Increase the value for [NumEntries] on the RAMDRIVE.SYS line in the
   CONFIG.SYS file. Note: The maximum value you can use is 1024.
