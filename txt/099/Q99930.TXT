The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows introduces a new .GLB file,
ACCESS4.GLB. This file is found in the WINDOWS\MSMAIL\MSRMT\GLB directory of
your local hard drive.

ACCESS4.GLB contains only one record (the same information contained in
ACCESS3.GLB), with the exception that this information is for the current user
ID only, not for other users on your postoffice. ACCESS4.GLB is required to sign
in to Mail Remote for Windows.


MORE INFORMATION
================

If ACCESS4.GLB is missing, you will receive the following error message during
sign in:

   STOP: Mail could not connect to your Mail server.

To build a new ACCESS4.GLB file, copy the contents of the user data disk in the
WINDOWS\MSMAIL\MSRMT\USERINFO directory before starting Mail Remote for Windows.
ACCESS4.GLB will be built automatically during sign in.

Additional query words: 3.20
