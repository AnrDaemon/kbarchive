SUMMARY
=======

MsgColor.exe is a sample file that demonstrates how to change the background and
text color of a message box by subclassing the message box.

MsgColor.exe implements the ColorMessageBox() function, which creates a message
box whose background and text color can be changed. The function subclasses the
message box and processes WM_CTLCOLOR to modify the colors. Subclassing the
message box requires obtaining the window handle of the message box. The window
handle is obtained using a WH_CBT hook. The hook is called when the message box
is created, and provides access to the window handle.
