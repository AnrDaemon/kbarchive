The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1, 3.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Versions 3.0 and 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks provide two
different kinds of servers: retail and upgrade. Both versions are identical
except that the retail version of the server contains a unique serial number and
has the ability to create a new data file. The upgrade server does not contain a
serial number and does not have the ability to create a new data file. Both
servers, however, can upgrade an existing data file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When installing Microsoft Mail, the Microsoft Mail Server program checks for a
valid Microsoft Mail Data file in the System Folder.

If such a file does not exist, and if you are using a retail version of the
server program, the installation program creates a new Microsoft Mail Data file
and assigns the serial number of the Mail Server program. You cannot change the
serial number of a mail server once the number has been written to the data
file.

If a data file does not exist, and if you are using upgrade version of the server
program, the following message appears:

   The Microsoft Mail Server could not be loaded because Update servers may only
   be used with an existing "Microsoft Mail Data" file.

In both cases (if you are using either a retail version or an upgrade version),
if a data file already exists, the Microsoft Mail Server will update its own
internal serial number using the information contained within the data file.

Because Microsoft Mail uses the serial number contained within the data file when
it communicates with other servers, it is possible to replace the Microsoft Mail
Server file and maintain serial number integrity.

NOTE: The Microsoft Mail server must be an extension in order to get a serial
number. If the Microsoft Mail Server is running as an application, it will use
the Microsoft Mail Data file's serial number for operation, but it will not
change its internal serial number to match. This is important if the Microsoft
Mail Server is an upgrade because it will not allow for a new datafile to be
created at a later date.
