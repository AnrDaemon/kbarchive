SYMPTOMS
========

When PC-CACHE is loaded with MS-DOS you may receive the following error
message:

   Data Monitor has already been loaded into memory. PC-CACHE must be loaded
   into memory BEFORE these programs. Unload them from memory, then load
   PC-CACHE. Press any key to continue.

This message is displayed when you try to load PC-CACHE after MS-DOS UNDELETE or
Central Point Software (CPS) Data Monitor.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, either use SMARTDrive instead of PC-CACHE or load
UNDELETE before PC-CACHE.
