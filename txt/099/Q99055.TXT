======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In version 1.0 of Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, if you reply to a message
sent to yourself, the copy you receive in your Inbox incorrectly displays your
name in single quotation marks. This is inconsistent with the way your name is
displayed in a standard mail message.

For example, the copy of the message you receive in your Inbox displays your name
as:

   To: 'Your Name'

A standard mail message displays your name as:

   To: Your Name

CAUSE
=====

This is a known problem with Simple MAPI trying to resolve the user's name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 1.0 of Microsoft
Electronic Forms Designer. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
