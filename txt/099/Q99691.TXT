SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using a Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet series printer with a version
2.1 printer driver from Hewlett-Packard, you may receive the following error
message when you try to open or print from a Windows- based application or
change the setup of your DeskJet printer:

   HP DeskJet Series v2.1 Error

   Printer Fonts missing; select "Printer Fonts" to install fonts or select "OK"
   again to exit

CAUSE
=====

When you use version 2.1 of the HP DeskJet series printer drivers with a
DeskJet, there is an option to install printer and/or screen fonts from the
drivers disks. If these fonts have been installed, the system sometimes is
unable to locate them. In this case, the fonts need to be reinstalled. To do
this, use the workaround listed below. For more information or assistance, call
Hewlett-Packard Technical Support


WORKAROUND
==========

1. Open Control Panel and choose the Printers icon.

2. Select the DeskJet printer from the list of installed printers, then choose
   Setup.

3. Choose Fonts, choose Printer Fonts, then choose OK.

4. In the Install Printer Fonts dialog box, choose Install Fonts.

5. Insert the second disk for the HP printer driver version 2.1 in your floppy
   disk drive. In the Install Fonts: Source Directory box, type the path to the
   disk. For example, if your floppy disk drive is A, type "A:\" (without the
   quotation marks).
