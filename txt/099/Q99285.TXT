-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Sound System, versions 1.0, 1.0a, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Extracting frames from the VidEdit utility that ships with Microsoft Video for
Windows results in bitmap images at a color depth of 8 bit only. This occurs
even if the current AVI sequence is captured at a color depth of 16 or 24 bit.
This is by design.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. In VidEdit, open an AVI sequence that uses a 16- or 24-bit color depth.

2. From the File menu, choose Extract.

3. From the List Of Files Type list box, choose Microsoft Windows DIB.

4. Type a valid filename with a DIB extension into the File Name text box and
   choose OK.

5. The resulting file (FILENAME.DIB) will be at an 8-bit color depth.
