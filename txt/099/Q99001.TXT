SUMMARY
=======

When you upgrade version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks Mail
Server to version 3.1, you must remove the MCI CommGATE gateway prior to the
upgrade and re-install it after the upgrade is complete. If the gateway is not
removed and re-installed, it may fail to function.

To Upgrade to Version 3.1 with the MCI CommGATE Gateway
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Use the Gateway Installer application to copy the CommGATE Gateway
   Recipients. Log in to the gateway server as the Network Manager and launch
   the Gateway Installer. Select the CommGATE MCI gateway and select the Copy
   Accounts and Recipients item from the Gateway Menu option. Choose the Save
   button to extract a copy of the CommGATE Gateway Recipients into the CommGATE
   MCI Acct/Recip file.

2. Remove the CommGATE gateway by selecting Gateway:Remove Gateway from the top
   menu bar.

3. Upgrade the Microsoft Mail server to version 3.1.

4. Re-install the CommGATE gateway as described in the CommGATE Administrator's
   Guide.

5. Restore the CommGATE Gateway Accounts and Recipients using the Gateway
   Installer Application. Log in to the gateway server as the Network Manager
   and launch the Gateway Installer. Select the CommGATE MCI gateway and go to
   Gateway:Install Accounts and Recipients from the top menu bar. Select the
   Accounts and Recipient file that was created prior to the server upgrade
   (CommGATE MCI Acct/Recip) and choose the Install button.
