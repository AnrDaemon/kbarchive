The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP allows you to specify the
how many attempts (-Qnnn) the SMTPGATE program makes to connect to a
SMTP host and the wait time between such attempts (-Wnnn).

The -Q attempts option works in conjunction with the -W wait option. The
SMTPGATE.EXE tries to connect to the SMTP host once. If it fails to
connect, it waits the time specified with the -W option to make its
next attempt to connect. These attempts continue at time intervals
specified with the -W option as long as the connections continue to fail or
the connection attempts value is reached as specified with the -Q option.
 

Example
-------

 
Assume the default -Q value of 180, and the -W value of 60 seconds is used,
then:

The SMTP Gateway tries sending the message up to 180 times at 60 second
intervals for a total time of 180 minutes or three hours. The message is
then returned to the sender as undeliverable.

The connection attempts option (-Qnnn) specifies the maximum number of
attempts the SMTPGATE program makes to connect to an SMTP host before
stopping. The default value is 180.

The wait option (-Wnnn) specifies how much time elapses between checks
for outgoing SMTP mail on the local area network. It is specified in
seconds. The default value is 120.
