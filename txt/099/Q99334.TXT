TITLE   :DOCERR: Metafile Terminator Record Not Documented
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The metafile file format, which is described in the Windows Software Development
Kit (SDK) version 3.1 "Programmer's Reference, Volume 4: Resources" manual, does
not contain the entire metafile format; the definition of the metafile
terminator record is missing.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The metafile terminator record denotes the end of the disk-based metafile, and
is the last record in the file. The function number for the terminator
(rdFunction) is 0 (zero) and the size (rdSize) is 3 words.

This information is needed for applications that manually read and write
metafiles, bypassing the standard graphical device interface (GDI) functions. If
an application manually creates a metafile, it must place the terminator record
as the last record in the file. If an application is reading a metafile
manually, it must terminate reading the records after seeing a terminator
record.

Additional query words: 3.10 docerr no32bit
