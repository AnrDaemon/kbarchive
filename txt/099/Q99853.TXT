SUMMARY
=======

Versions 2.1 and 3.0 of Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP may display the following
error message:

   "WARNING getline: NL with no CR"

This error message indicates that the SMTP Gateway program has received a message
that does not use CRLF to delineate SMTP header fields. RFC 822 "Standard for
the Format of ARPA INTERNET Text Messages," section 3.1.2 "Structure of Header
Fields" specifies that header fields should end with CRLF.

This is only a warning message. Mail continues to be processed even if you make
no changes to the SMTP gateway.
