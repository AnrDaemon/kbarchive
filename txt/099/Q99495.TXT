The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

MS-DOS MemMaker may stop responding (hang) on a system that includes the line
DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE AUTO in the CONFIG.SYS file. When you run MemMaker with
this line active, it hangs on a blue screen that says "Microsoft MemMaker." At
this point, you must turn off your computer and then turn it on again. Pressing
CTRL+ALT+DEL does not work.

CAUSE
=====

The EMM386.EXE AUTO switch enables expanded memory support only if a program
calls for it. Therefore, EMM386.EXE is essentially on hold if you are using the
AUTO switch. MemMaker tries to determine the status of EMM386.EXE, but it cannot
do so when the AUTO switch is active.

Additional query words: 6.22 6.00 6.20
