======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for Macintosh, version 2.01 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you do not have both read and write privileges for the drive from which the
.DBF file is being accessed and EXCLUSIVE is set to ON, FoxBASE+/Mac generates
the error message

   File is in use by another.

CAUSE
=====

FoxBASE+/Mac requires both read and write privileges to view a database file
because FoxBASE+/Mac changes a bit in the header of the file for
network-handling purposes.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FoxBASE+/MAC version 2.01. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
