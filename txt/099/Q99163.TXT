TITLE   :Mac Bkup: Retrospect Remote Backup May Corrupt Local Data File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For Appletalk Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.1a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.1, 3.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If Retrospect Remote is backing up version 3.1 or later of a remote Microsoft
Mail for AppleTalk Networks workstation, the backup may cause Mail to close the
local data file. Mail may return the following error message:

   Your local mail file has been closed due to an unknown error.

Moreover, the data file may become corrupted due to this process.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this problem, do the following:

1. Have the administrator configure Retrospect Remote not to back up the "MS
   Mail Local Folders" folder.

2. The user must be sure to sign out of Mail before the backup is run. To ensure
   sign-out, the user should choose Close & Sign Out from the Mail Menu.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The local mail data file can be considered similar to the server data file, in
the sense that it is a file that is kept open to read from and write to while
Mail is running.

In the case of the local data file, the Mail workstation software manages when
information is read, written, and deleted. If another process attempts to access
the local data file at the same time Microsoft Mail is accessing the file, the
workstation will respond with the above message.

For details on configuring Retrospect Remote, call Dantz Development at (510)
849-0293.
