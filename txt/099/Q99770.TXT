Windows NT does not support printing to a SCSI device by itself. It
provides file system support for a SCSI printer port; however, it
lacks a separate "print monitor" module. A print monitor is needed to
communicate to SCSI ports. Application programming interfaces (APIs)
for building print monitors are included in the Windows NT Device
Driver Kit (DDK). Third-party vendors may make available print
monitors after the final release of Windows NT.
