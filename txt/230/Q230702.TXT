PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCommandLine kbSSafe600bug kbSSExplorer kbDSupport kbGrpDSSSafe kbSSafe600qfe kbVS600s

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When permanently deleting or renaming a project in the Microsoft Visual
SourceSafe (VSS) Explorer, you may receive a series of errors:

   File or project not found

followed by:

   1E String load failure, string #%d

RESOLUTION
==========

This feature is available in the latest service pack for Visual Studio 6.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q194022 INFO: Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, What, Where, Why

WORKAROUND
----------

These operations can be performed at the command line. For example, the following
operation is for the delete permanently operation:

   ss destroy $/myproj

The following is for the rename operation:

   ss rename $/myproj $/yourproj

Note that this produces multiple "File or project not found" errors, but it will
complete.

An alternative workaround exists in the case of permanently deleting files. The
error messages do not occur when deleting without destroying and then purging
from the Visual SourceSafe Explorer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the next service pack for
Visual Studio 6.0.

format.
