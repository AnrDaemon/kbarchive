SUMMARY

This article describes how to display hidden multiple users from the Address

MORE INFORMATION
================

To display hidden multiple users from the Address Book, perform the following
steps:

1. In the Exchange Administrator program menu, on the Tools menu, click
   Directory Export.

2. In Directory Export, select the container (and subcontainers if necessary)
   where the hidden recipients are located.

3. Choose an export filename.

4. Select the types of objects that you want to unhide.

5. Check the "Include hidden objects" check box, and click Export.

6. When the export is finished, open the <filename>.csv file in a suitable
   editor (for example, Microsoft Excel). The exported file will include a
   column entitled "Hide from AB."

7. Change the attribute value from 1 to 0 in that column for those entries that
   you want to make visible, and save the file.

8. In the Exchange Administrator program menu, on the Tools menu, select
   Directory Import, and click Import File.

9. Use the Browse window to select the file that you modified.

10. Leave the other settings at the default settings.

When the import is done, the hidden recipients will be visible.
