TITLE   :XCON: How to Configure X.400 to Send System Messages Only
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp1

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

It may be necessary to use the X.400 Connector to deliver system messages ONLY
(for example, for directory replication, public folder replication, and so on).
In such cases, you may want to use other connectors (for example, the Internet
Mail Service) to deliver regular user mail. This may become necessary to reduce
operation costs because of dedicated lines or the amount of data transferred by
the X.400 Connector.

This feature requires that Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1 is already
installed on the server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To configure the X.400 Connector as mentioned above:

WARNING: Using the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program (admin
/r) incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall
Microsoft Windows NT Server and/or Microsoft Exchange Server. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of raw mode can be
solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode by
   typing the following at a command prompt:

   "c:\exchsrvr\bin\admin /r" (without the quotation marks)

2. In raw mode, under Organization, click Site, click Configuration, and click
   the Connections container.

3. In the right window, click the X.400 Connector you want to use to deliver
   System messages ONLY.

4. On the File menu, click Raw Properties.

5. Under "List attributes of type", click All. Under Object attributes, click
   Heuristics.

6. In the Edit value field, type "8192" (without the quotation marks).

7. Click Set, and click OK.

8. Stop and re-start the Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA)
   service.

9. Test it.

Now the X.400 Connector can only send System messages and all other user mail is
forced to use the Internet Mail Service.
