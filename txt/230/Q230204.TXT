TITLE   :SNA Server Fails Due to Access Violation in SNADMOD!RpcRouteProc
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0SP1,3.0SP2,3.0SP3,4.0,4.0SP1,4.0SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsna400sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0SP1, 3.0SP2, 3.0SP3, 4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Server service (Snaservr.exe) may fail unexpectedly or may stop
accepting new client connections when the access violation in
SNADMOD!RpcRoutProc occurs. This results in one or both of the following:

 - Previously-connected users lose their host (mainframe or AS/400) sessions.
 - New users are unable to obtain a new host session.

If the Windows NT Server where SNA Server is running is configured with
Drwtsn32.exe as the default debugger, a Drwtsn32.log entry may be generated when
this failure occurs, indicating a FAULT in the top-level routine along with the
following stack-back trace (which may vary):

       snadmod!RpcRouteProc+0x400
       snadmod!sepdq2_int+0x122
       ntdll!RtlLeaveCriticalSection+0x1d
       snadmod!sbpdin_int+0x23d
       snadmod!sbpdin+0x25
       snaservr!sbpcdin+0x50
       snaservr!sbpsched+0x2ac
       snaservr!sbpgmain+0x25
       snasvc!ServiceMainFunction+0x140
       advapi32!ScSvcctrlThreadA+0xe
       kernel32!BaseThreadStart+0x51

In the reported instances of this problem, the SNA Server systems had to be
rebooted to recover.

CAUSE
=====

The access violation occurs when an SNA Server RPC Response message is
inadvertently routed to the SNA Server service. The SNA Server service is unable
to interpret this message, which causes the access violation to occur.

RESOLUTION
==========
