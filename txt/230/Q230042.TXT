   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

Mailbox Cleanup Agent (MBClean) installs as a manually starting service. If it
is set as an automatically starting service, it may fail to start during reboot
because the Microsoft Exchange information store service has not started. This
is because MBClean has no dependencies set and attempts to start before the
Microsoft Exchange information store service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To set the MBClean service as a dependant service on the information store
service, add the following registry entry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMCA

   Value: DependOnService
   DataType: REG_MULTI_SZ
   Data: MSExchangeIS

This will make the MBClean service dependant on the Microsoft Exchange
information store service, forcing the MBClean service to wait for the
information store service to start before starting itself.
