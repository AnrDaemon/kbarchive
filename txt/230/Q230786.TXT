SUMMARY
=======

If you use Network Monitor in Systems Management Server version 1.2 or Network
Monitor from the Windows NT Server version 4.0 compact disc, you are not able to
view Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) packets. Network
Monitor in Systems Management Server version 1.2 or Network Monitor from the
Windows NT Server version 4.0 compact disc does not parse RADIUS traffic.
Network Monitor must be upgraded to Network Monitor version 2.0. After Network
Monitor has been updated to version 2.0 and RADIUS is configured to use port
1645 and 1646 for Authentication and Accounting, you are able to view RADIUS
traffic in a Network Monitor trace. According to RFC 2026 the ports used by
RADIUS have been changed to 1812 and 1813 for Authentication and Accounting,
respectively.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To view RADIUS packets using RFC-compliant ports 1812 and 1813:

1. In the parsers directory created by Network Monitor, edit the Tcpip.ini file.

2. In this file, find the [UDP_HandoffSet] section.

3. At the bottom of this section, locate:

   1645 = Radius
   1646 = Radius

4. Change 1645 to 1812 and 1646 to 1813.

5. Save the file.

When you run Network Monitor, you now see RADIUS session packets initiated by
RADIUS.
