TITLE   :Inbox and Internet Explorer Icons Disabled with Appsec.exe
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you enable the Application Security tool (Appsec.exe) in Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition, the desktop icons for the Windows Messaging client
(Inbox) and Microsoft Internet Explorer do not function. If you double-click
either icon, the following error message is displayed:

   Is not a valid Windows NT application.

No program name is referenced.

CAUSE
=====

The Inbox icon does not function because no entries are included in the
Application Security tool authorized program list to allow the Windows Messaging
client to run.

The Internet Explorer desktop icon does not function because the MS-DOS naming
convention (or 8.3 naming convention) path for Internet Explorer is not in the
Application Security tool authorized program list.

The default authorized program list for the Application Security tool includes
the path for Internet Explorer in long file name format. The registry contains
pointers to Internet Explorer (in multiple Shell\Open\Command keys) in both long
file name and MS-DOS 8.3 (short file name) format. The Application Security tool
performs a character-for-character comparison of the location in which the file
runs. If there are any discrepancies, the program does not run.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, add the following entries to the Application Security
tool authorized program list.

For the Windows Messaging client:

 - c:\Program Files\Windows NT\Windows Messaging\exchng32.exe

 - c:\WTSRV\System32\mapisp32.exe

For Internet Explorer:

 - c:\PROGRA~1\Plus!\MICROS~1\iexplore.exe

NOTE: A default installation of Terminal Server on drive C requires these
entries.
