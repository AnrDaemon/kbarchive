TITLE   :SMS: SQL Monitor Reports Cannot Connect to Site Server Registry
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms200fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Smsdbmon.log continuously reports the following error:

   ERROR: Could not connect to registry key
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS on site server MYSERVER, sleeping
   60 seconds.

The error message continues to be reported even though the site server shown in
the error message has become available.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by the site server being unavailable (or down) when the
SQL Monitor service is started. Usually this happens when the site server and
SQL server are on different machines. Even after the site server becomes
available, the SQL Monitor cannot connect to the registry of the site server,
and therefore this error persists.

WORKAROUND
==========

When the site server is available, stop and restart the SMS_SQL_MONTIOR service
on the SQL server. Once the service restarts, it should be able to get a
connection to the site server. Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in
Systems Management Server version 2.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 2.0. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
