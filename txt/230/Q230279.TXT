TITLE   :Corrupted User Profiles Can Cause New Local Default to Be Lost
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you download a corrupted profile from the central server, error 1009 is
logged in the Event System log. A new local profile is then created from the
local default setting. However, after you restart your computer, the computer
does not reference the new local profile and begins the cycle of loading the
corrupted profile from the server again. The following error message is then
displayed:

   The system cannot find the drive specified.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when Terminal Server detects a certain type of profile
corruption. A flag is set, causing the reference to the newly created user
profile to not be saved in the registry. The user is given a new copy of the
local default profile and can make changes to it. These changes are saved to the
hard disk. When the computer is restarted, it searches for the local version to
check the time stamp versus the server version. This check is ONLY made against
profiles listed in the registry (not against the physical files in the profile
directory) and thus, the recently created local copy is ignored. The computer
then repeats the process of downloading the server copy (which is still
corrupted) and the cycle repeats.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
