The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following newsgroups are automatically installed with the NNTP server:

 - Control.cancel
 - Control.newgroup
 - Control.rmgroup
 - Microsoft.public.ins

The Microsoft.public.ins newsgroup is a sample newsgroup that contains a welcome
message. It can be used to immediately test if messages can successfully be
posted and read on the NNTP Server. You can delete this newsgroup if you want.

The control.* newsgroups work in conjunction with the control messages generated
by NNTP client software, NNTP utilities, and NNTP servers. Deleting these
newsgroups will interfere with the proper operation of these control messages.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Messages" topic in the online product documentation at this example URL:
