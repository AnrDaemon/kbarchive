   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes, the
installation may fail, and the following error message may be displayed:

   Could not open file E:\Program
   Files\Exchange\Connect\Exchconn\Setup\LMEISTAT.TXT to check return code of
   LME utility. Setup cannot continue.

The actual path may vary.

CAUSE
=====

Exchange Server is installed to a path with a space character in it. By default,
Exchange Server is installed to the Exchsrvr folder located on a certain drive.
You can configure the Setup program to install Exchange Server to a different
path. However, if the path name includes a space character (" "), for example,
C:\Exchange Server, the Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes cannot be installed
properly.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem you need to edit the registry:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Stop all Exchange Server services.

2. Create a new folder to install the Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes, for
   example, E:\Exchsrvr.

3. Go to the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCALMACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\Setup

   If a sub tree Exchconn exists, delete it.

4. Go to the following registry key:

   \HKEY_LOCALMACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\Setup\Services

   This key points to your existing Exchange Server path. Write down the current
   value. Change this value to the folder that you created in step 2.

5. Run the Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes again.

6. Revert the registry key in step 4 to the original value.

7. Restart all of the Exchange Server services.
