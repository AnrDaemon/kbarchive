   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

The Domain Name Resolver (DNR) client implemented in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack
4 (SP4) does not send unqualified queries to the Domain Name System (DNS)
server.

CAUSE
=====

An unqualified query is a DNS short name query for the host name sent after
stripping the domain name portion of the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).
This is not a valid DNS query. Eliminating this last short name query from the
DNS lookup phase in SP4 enhances DNR performance.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

If you want to re-enable last short name query using DNS, set the data value of
the AllowUnqualifiedQuery value to 1 in the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\

   Value Name: AllowUnqualifiedQuery
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Valid Range: 0-1
   Default: 0

MORE INFORMATION
================

"Devolution" may be appropriate in normal DNR usage. If a DNS query for
<client>.<domainname>.com is unresolved, it is devolved to
<client>.com and eventually to <client>. This last unqualified query
is eliminated from the name query process.
