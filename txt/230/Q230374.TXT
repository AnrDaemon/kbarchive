TITLE   :'Subscript out of range' Error When Saving a Component Library
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0 SP2,4.0SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 4.0 SP2 
 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS Component Builder (CB) displays
the following error message when trying to save a component library:

   Subscript out of range.

CAUSE
=====

A User Defined Type (UDT) has been specified as the automation type for a column
of an ADO recordset.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not specify a UDT as the automation type for a column of an ADO recordset.
UDTs are not a supported type for a recordset.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the COM Transaction Integrator
for CICS and IMS version 4.0 SP2.


MORE INFORMATION
================

When creating a COMTI component library using CB, it is possible to modify the
automation type of an existing recordset column to specify a UDT as the
automation type. UDTs already defined in the library are listed in the drop-down
list box of available automation types for the recordset column. This is an
error.

When creating a new column for a recordset, UDTs are not listed in the drop-down
list box of available automation types.
