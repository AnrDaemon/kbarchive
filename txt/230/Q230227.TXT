SUMMARY
=======

Certificate Authority (CA) certificates created by Microsoft Certificate Server
are not Base64 encoded, which is expected by Netscape Navigator.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Bin264 utility is available to perform Base64 encoding of certificates.
Please note that this utility is not supported by Microsoft in any way and is
provided for testing purposes only.

For more information about the Bin264 utility and Base64 encoding, see the
following Microsoft Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/security/tech/certificates/formats.asp

The CertUtil utility installs automatically with Certificate Server 2.0 and can
also be used to encode certificates to Base64.

Usage: CertUtil [Options] -encode InFile OutFile, where InFile is the binary
certificate and OutFile is the resulting Base64 certificate.

Additional query words: root base-64 64-bit akz
