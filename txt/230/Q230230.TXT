The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, Terminal Server Edition

SYMPTOMS
========

If the "Password protected" option for the screen saver is selected during a
Windows NT Server, Terminal Server Edition client session:

 - The screen saver does not lock the workstation when you minimize the Terminal
   Server client program.

 - The Logoff option on the Start menu does not function; the only way to log
   off under this condition is to press CTRL+ALT+END, and select Logoff.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two ways to avoid this problem:

 - Do not minimize the Terminal Server client application if you are using a
   password protected screen saver.

   OR

 - Press CTRL+ALT+END, and then click Lock Workstation before you minimize the
   Terminal Server client application.

STATUS
======
