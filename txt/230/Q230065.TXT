SUMMARY
=======

To create a virtual directory for a newsgroup, perform the following steps:

1. Start the Internet Service Manager (ISM), which loads the Internet
   Information Server snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

2. Right-click Default NNTP Site, click New, and then click Virtual Directory.

3. In the New Virtual Directory Wizard dialog box, type the Newsgroup name, and
   then click Next.

   NOTE: This is NOT case sensitive.

4. Provide the physical path for the directory, and then click Finish.

From now on, the .nws files for articles in the newsgroup will be stored in the
specified virtual directory, rather than the default location of
C:\InetPub\nntpfile\root\<NewsgroupName>.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If no articles were created for the newsgroup before the virtual directory was
created, then the .xix subject files will also be stored in the virtual
directory.

However, if articles did exist before the virtual directory was created, the .nws
files for those articles, along with the existing .xix subject files, will
continue to reside in the C:\InetPub\nntpfile\root\<NewsgroupName>
location.
