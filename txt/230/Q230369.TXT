 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you view the Microsoft Word Help topic about the TOC field, the information
about using up to five characters with the "\p" switch is incorrect.

   \p "Separators"     Specifies the characters that separate an entry
                       and its page number. For example, the field
                       {TOC \p "---"} displays a result such as
                       "Selecting Text---53." The default is a tab with
                       leader dots. You can use up to five characters,
                       which must be enclosed in quotation marks.

For more information about the TOC field, click "Contents and Index" on the Help
menu, click the Index tab in Word Help, type the following text

   TOC

and then double-click the selected text to go to the "Field codes: TOC (Table of
Contents) field" topic. If you are unable to find the information you need, ask
the Office Assistant.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The maximum number of characters that can be used with the "\p" switch is one.
The Word TOC Help topic should correctly state the following:

   \p "Separator"      Specifies the character that separates an entry
                       and its page number. For example, the field
                       {TOC \p "-"} displays a result such as
                       "Selecting Text-53." The default is a tab with
                       leader dots. You can use only one character,
                       which must be enclosed in quotation marks.
