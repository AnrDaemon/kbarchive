======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To be correctly configured, site connectors need proper trusts, permissions, and
correct settings on Override tab on the Site Connector Properties page. This is
in contrast to X.400 Connectors, which are independent of trusts and permissions
issues. This article discusses how to effectively configure a site connector
with different possible scenarios.

MORE INFORMATION
================

How to Configure a Site Connector
---------------------------------

Between Untrusted Windows NT Domains:

Use the exact same site service account name and password for both sites in
separate Windows NT domains. Assign the Service Account Admin role to both
service accounts for the Organization, Site, and Configuration containers. This
needs to be done at both sites. Use the Override tab on the Site Connector
Properties page, and provide the service account name, password, and domain name
of the other domain.

Between Trusted Domains Using the Exact Same Site Service Account and Password:

Assign the Service Account Admin role to both service accounts for the
Organization, Site, and Configuration containers. This needs to be done at both
sites. There is no need to use the Override tab.

NOTE: Microsoft Product Support Services recommends using the Override tab, just
in case, if trusts between Windows NT domains get broken. Site connector will
still be fully functional and will not be affected by the broken trust.

Between Trusted Domains Using Different Site Service Accounts
-------------------------------------------------------------

Assign the Service Account Admin role to both service accounts for the
Organization, Site, and Configuration containers. This needs to be done on both
sites. Use the Override tab, and provide the service account name, password, and
domain name of the other domain.
