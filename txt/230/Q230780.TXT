TITLE   :XADM: Cannot Start KM Service After Upgrading to V3 Certificates
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you import a certificate from a Certificate Server on a Key Management (KM)
Server that is configured to issue X.509 V1 certificates only, and then you use
the same certification authority (CA) to configure the KM Server to issue V3
certificates, you may not be able to restart the KM service.

CAUSE
=====

When you configure the KM Server to issue V3 certificates, it imports the CA's
certificate. If the CA's certificate has already been imported, the KM Server
may be unable to save the updated certificate list.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.
