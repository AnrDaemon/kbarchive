-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) or Windows NT 4.0 Service
Pack 5 (SP5) on your computer, the computer automatically adjusts for daylight
savings time even if the option was previously turned off.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because applying SP4 or SP5 re-enables the "automatically
adjust clock for daylight savings changes" option.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Date/Time, click the Time Zone tab, and then clear the
   "Automatically adjust clock for daylight savings changes" check box.

NOTE: You must do this after each application of a service pack.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
