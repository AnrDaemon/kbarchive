TITLE   :XFOR: Attachments Corrupted by Incorrect Mapping in Cmsxmap.tbl
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On an IBM OV/VM computer, if you use the Sendfile command to send a PC Binary
type attachment in the Netdata format to Microsoft Exchange Server, the
attachment may become corrupted.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because Microsoft Exchange Connector for IBM OV/VM
(PROFS) cannot convert an attachment if loose definition occurs in the mapping
table file Cmsxmap.tbl.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, modify the mapping table file Cmsxmap.tbl in the
Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn\Tables folder, so that it identifies the binary files
from the host. The following is an updated Cmsxmap.tbl file:

   LISTING EBCDIC
   EXEC EBCDIC
   SCRIPT EBCDIC
   $SCRIPT EBCDIC
   OFSMCNTL EBCDIC
   DIRECTRY EBCDIC
   BIN BINARY
   COM BINARY
   DOC BINARY
   EXE BINARY
   PPT BINARY
   XLS BINARY
   XLW BINARY
   ZIP BINARY
   VSD BINARY
   MDB BINARY
   * EBCDIC
