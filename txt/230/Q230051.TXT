TITLE   :XFOR: Internet Mail Connector Dial-Up Connection Stops Working
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Internet Mail Connector on an Exchange 5.5 server is initially configured to
forward all mail to a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) host over a dial-up
connection. This works fine and all SMTP mail is successfully sent using the
Remote Access Service (RAS) link to the remote host.

However, problems may occur if an additional entry is created using the Email
Domain button on the Connections tab of the Microsoft Internet Mail Service. If
that connection is set to use Domain Name Service (DNS) or forwards all messages
directly to a host using a local area network (LAN) link instead of RAS, the
dial-up connection specified on the Connections tab never dials again.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack
