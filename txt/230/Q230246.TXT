TITLE   :16-Bit MS-DOS-Based Programs Not Supported for Software Metering
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsmsMeter

SUMMARY
=======

Most 16-bit and 32-bit Windows-based programs are supported for Software
Metering. However, Software Metering cannot track or meter 16-bit MS-DOS-based
programs on Microsoft Windows NT Software Metering clients.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Windows NT, MS-DOS-based programs are started in a virtual MS-DOS window
(Ntvdm.exe). Software Metering registers programs in the same way that Task
Manager recognizes running processes. MS-DOS-based or 16-bit Windows-based
programs that are listed as Ntvdm.exe or Ntvdm\Wowexec.exe are not displayed
because they are included in the default list of excluded programs in Software
Metering.

To verify if your program can be tracked by Software Metering:

1. Start the program.

2. Start Task Manager, and then click the Processes tab.

3. If the program file or registerable file (.exe, .dll, .scr, .mod, .tsk, or
   .bin file) is listed, it can be tracked by Software Metering.
