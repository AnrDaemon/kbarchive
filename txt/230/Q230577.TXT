TITLE   :Error Message "The Drive Is Not Ready for Use" at Startup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start your computer, you may receive the following error message:

   The drive is not ready for use Device/Harddisk0/partition0. Its door may be
   open. Please check drive and make sure that a disk is inserted and that the
   drive door is closed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you have a Zip drive and Norton Utilities installed.
Norton Utilities queries the Zip drive and generates the error message if there
is no disk in the drive. You receive no error message if there is a disk in the
drive. This apparently occurs only if the Zip drive is installed after Norton
Utilities is installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Uninstall and reinstall Norton Utilities. Disabling Norton Utilities does not
resolve the problem. For information about how to uninstall or reinstall Norton
Utilities, please consult the program's documentation or manufacturer.
