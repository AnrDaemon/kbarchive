TITLE   :XADM: Changing Dedicated PF Server May Break AutoAccept Scripts
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you change the private information store to point to another Exchange Server
computer for public folders, event scripting (AutoAccept scripts) may not run on
existing resource and conference room mailboxes.

CAUSE
=====

Pointing the private information store to a dedicated public folder server
affects the processing of AutoAccept scripts and may break AutoAccept scripts on
existing resource accounts. AutoAccept scripts read the Free/Busy system folder
for free and busy information. If you change the private information store to
point to another server, the Free/Busy system folder is also changed, and the
AutoAccept script can no longer read the Free/Busy system folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To ensure that event scripting works on existing resource accounts, perform the
following steps:

1. Rehome the EventConfig_<server> system folder to the dedicated public
   folder server.

2. Run the Event Service on the dedicated public folder server.

3. In the client, right-click the Inbox. Click Properties, click the Agents tab,
   and then point scripting to run on the new public folder server.
