TITLE   :XADM: Rules in Error and Error Unknown
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you set up a rule in Microsoft Outlook by using the Rules Wizard or the Inbox
Assistant to forward incoming mail to another user, the following error message
may be displayed:

   RULES IN ERROR
   Rule: "<name_of_rule>"
   Error: Unknown Error

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the Exchange Server 5.5 post Service Pack 1 (SP1) fix
has been applied to the Exchange Server computer. The post-SP1 fix does not
handle forwarding rules in the client.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, click the following article number to
view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error message is only displayed the first time that the rule starts. After
that, if you start Outlook as the user for whom the rule was created, the error
message is not displayed, but the rule does not work.

store, the following events are logged in the following sequence:
