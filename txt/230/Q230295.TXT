Configuring Content Analyzer to Work With Your Proxy Server

To configure Content Analyzer to be used in conjunction with an established proxy server, enter the appropriate information in the Proxy tab of the Content Analyzer View/Program Options dialog box. If you're not sure if you are using a proxy server, contact your system administrator. You may also need to ask your administrator for any required user name or password.

Known Issues

Please note the following known issues:

When mapping a site, Content Analyzer will access every URL within that site. This is equivalent to a user clicking on every link. If you have links to gateway scripts that have side effects (for example, manipulating records in a database), these will all be executed, potentially altering data stored outside of the HTML content of the site.
