-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a list or paragraphs containing bullets, Word replaces any
leading numbers or a single letter followed by a period (an initial, for
example) with the bullet character.

CAUSE
=====

Word does not allow both a number and a bullet to appear at the beginning of a
paragraph or list item when you use the Bullets and Numbering command.

WORKAROUND
==========

To prevent Word from removing leading numbers from paragraphs or lists that you
want to format with bullets, use any of the following methods.

Method 1: Insert an Optional Hyphen

1. Press CTRL+HYPHEN.

2. Type the number, followed by the text you want.

3. Select the numbered text, and then on the Tools menu, click Bullets and
   Numbering.

4. On the Bullet tab, click to select the bullet you want, and then click OK.

5. On the Edit menu, click Replace.

6. In the Find what box, press CTRL+HYPHEN, leave the Replace with box blank,
   and then click Replace All.

Method 2: Place the Number in a QUOTE Field

1. Press CTRL+F9 to insert field braces.

2. Type "quote" and press the SPACEBAR.

3. Type the number you want between the quotation marks. For example, the field
   code should appear as follows:

   {quote "12.2"}

4. Press F9 to update the display results.

Method 3: Use a Macro

The following Visual Basic for Applications macro can replace the
ToolsBulletListDefault macro, which is assigned to the Bulleted List toolbar
button. The macro automates the typing of unique characters in front of the
numbers before adding bullets.

   Sub formatbulletdefault()
       With Selection
       If Selection.Range.ListFormat.ListType = wdListNoNumbering Then
       Selection.HomeKey Unit:=wdLine
       Selection.TypeText Text:=Chr(31)
       With ListGalleries(wdBulletGallery).ListTemplates(1).ListLevels(1) _
           .NumberStyle = wdListNumberStyleBullet
           With .Font
               .Name = "Symbol"
           End With
       End With
       ListGalleries(wdBulletGallery).ListTemplates(1).Name = ""
       Selection.Range.ListFormat.ApplyListTemplate _ 
            ListTemplate:=ListGalleries(wdBulletGallery).ListTemplates(1), _ 
            ContinuePreviousList:=False, ApplyTo:=wdListApplyToWholeList
       Selection.TypeBackspace
       Else
       Selection.Range.ListFormat.RemoveNumbers NumberType:=wdNumberParagraph
       End If
       End With
   End Sub
