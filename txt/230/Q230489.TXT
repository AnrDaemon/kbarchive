SUMMARY
=======

When displaying an image in the Wang (Kodak) ImageEdit control, you might want
to add text to the image. This article illustrates how this can be accomplished.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Wang (Kodak) controls, including ImageEdit, do not ship with Visual Basic,
but are included with some versions of Windows. The later versions of the Wang
controls are renamed as the Kodak controls. See the REFERENCES section below for
more information.

The following code example demonstrates how to accomplish this using the
Annotation features of the control. Please note that you will need to change the
.Image property to a file that resides on your computer.

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. From the Project menu, select Components, select either the Wang Image Edit
   Control or the Kodak Image Edit Control and click OK.

3. Add an instance of the Wang (Kodak) ImageEdit control to Form1.

4. Add the following code to Form1:

      With ImgEdit1 

         ' select a path to an image on your system
         .Image = "E:\tiffWANG\Simplicity1024.tif"
         .Display
         .AnnotationType = wiTextStamp
         .AnnotationFontColor = vbGreen
         .AnnotationStampText = "KILROY WAS HERE!"
         .Draw 10, 10
         .AnnotationType = wiNone
      End With
