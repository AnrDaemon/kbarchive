SYMPTOMS
========

When a project is opened or created with more than 4096 files, attempting to
save the workspace may result in the following message:

   The instruction at "0x519eccb6" referenced memory at "0x00000000". The memory
   could not be "read".

Viewing a stack trace of this exception shows that the fault occurs in
DevNcb.pkg. The error can occur when you exit the IDE by clicking Exit from the
File menu, or when you close the workspace by clicking Close Workspace from the
File menu.

RESOLUTION
==========

Following are some possible workarounds:

 - If the workspace contains multiple projects, you may be able to work around
   the problem by breaking projects into separate workspaces.

   -or-

 - If the workspace contains a project with many files, you may be able to work
   around the problem by combining some of your source files into fewer larger
   files, or separate static libraries.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++ .NET.
