The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Outlook, you can send a pointer to a public folder in the following format:

   outlook://Public Folders/All Public Folders/testfolder/~test.doc

If this link is sent to a client that uses another language than English, the
user cannot open the link.

CAUSE
=====

Unified Resource Locators (URL) to public folders are language-dependent. When
Outlook opens a URL, it tries to find the folders by name. For an English
client, it looks for "Public Folders;" on a German client, it looks for
"Oeffentliche Ordner."

NOTE: This example uses the German translation for the URL, so "Oe" or "oe"
stands for the letter "O" or "o" with Dieresis.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use localized URLs when sending Outlook public folders links to users that use
other language clients.


MORE INFORMATION
================

For example: An English user sends a link of a document called Test.doc to a
German user and includes the following URL:

   outlook://Public Folders/All Public Folders/testfolder/~test.doc

If the German user tries to open the URL, he or she receives an error message
that the folder cannot be found.

This happens because the German client is looking for "Public Folders," which
does not exist for the German client. On the German client, only a URL of
outlook://Oeffentliche Ordner/Alle oeffentlichen Ordner/testfolder/~test.doc
would succeed.
