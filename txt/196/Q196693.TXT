TITLE   :XADM: How To Use ESEUTIL /U to Upgrade a Database
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you have an Exchange Server database file (Priv.edb, Pub.edb, or Dir.edb)
from Exchange Server 4.0 or 5.0, you can use the ESEUTIL utility to manually
upgrade the database to an Exchange Server 5.5 database. This is particularly
useful if the only good backup you have for your Exchange Server computer is
from a previous version of Exchange Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In order to perform the upgrade using ESEUTIL, you will need the following
files:

 - The Exchange 5.5 version of Eseutil.exe

 - The Exchange 5.5 version of Ese.dll

 - The previous version database file (Priv.edb, Pub.edb or Dir.edb)

 - The Edb.dll from the Exchange 5.5 CD. This file can be found in the
   server\setup\<platform> directory on the Exchange 5.5 CD.

Put all of these files into a directory on your hard drive, open an MS-DOS
command prompt in that directory, and run the following command:

   " ESEUTIL /u <database name> /dEDB.DLL" (without the quotation marks)

where the <database name> is either Priv.edb, Pub.edb, or Dir.edb.

*NOTE: There is no space after the /d switch.

**NOTE: If you do not use the correct version of Edb.dll, you will receive the
following error:

   Error -1003 (0xfffffc15) = JET_errInvalidParameter
