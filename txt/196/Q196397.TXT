TITLE   :XADM: Using V1 Certificates After Applying 5.5 Service Pack 1
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp1

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1, Key Management Server
requires a Certificate Authority source (that is, Microsoft Certificate Server)
to distribute security keys.

Organizational regulations may not permit V3 certificates or specific
organizational units may want to continue using the original (pre-Service Pack 1
installation) Key Management Server interface.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1 adds the X.509-V3 Certificate
enhancement automatically when applied.

This is by design.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem and implement functional configuration
(Configuration prior to installation of Service Pack 1), perform the following
steps:

1. Start the Exchange Server 5.5 Administrator program, select the properties of
   the CA object in the 'Site/Configuration' container and log on as the
   Certificate Authority with the appropriate user name and password.

2. Click the 'Enrollment' tab.

3. Click the V1 Only radio button, and then click Apply.

4. Stop and restart the Key Management Service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Additional information regarding the advantages of using V3 certificates can be
found in the Support\Docs directory of the Microsoft Exchange 5.5 CD or the
Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Resource Guide.
