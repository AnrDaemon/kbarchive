IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start Microsoft Encarta Virtual Globe 99 on a computer
running Windows NT, a Dr. Watson error occurs. The Dr. Watson error is an
application error in Msworld.exe.

CAUSE
=====

Encarta Virtual Globe 99 modifies the registry when starting. As a result, to
use Microsoft Encarta Virtual Globe 99 on a computer running Windows NT, you
must have Administrator privileges or an administrator must change permissions
to a more accessible level on two registry keys.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

To resolve this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Log off as the current user.

2. Log on as an Administrator and change the Security Permissions on two keys in
   the registry. Allow the EVERYONE group Full Control permission on the
   following two registry entries:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Microsoft Reference

      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Microsoft Reference

   Now domain users will be able to use the Virtual Globe 99 software.
