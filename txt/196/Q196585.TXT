The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes adds the ability to synchronize
user lists from Lotus Notes into the Microsoft Exchange Server Global Address
List. By default, only the Lotus Notes mail address will be imported from the
Lotus Notes Address Book.

The ability to automatically create secondary addresses such as SMTP or X.400 can
be added to the Directory Synchronization process.

MORE INFORMATION
================

IMPORTANT: The below process of editing the Exchange Connector mapping files can
result in improper operation of the Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes.
Microsoft recommends backing up all referenced files before editing their
contents.

To automatically add a second proxy to Exchange Server directory entries, perform
the following steps:

1. Add a new field to Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn\Dxamex\Amap.tbl,

2. Add a second field (the length).

3. Add "Secondary-Proxy-Addresses(Type:)".

   Some examples would be as follows:

   SMTPAddr1 64 Proxy-Addresses(SMTP:)
   SMTPAddr2 64 Secondary-Proxy-Addresses(SMTP:)
   SMTPAddr3 64 Secondary-Proxy-Addresses(SMTP:)
   X400Addr1 64 Proxy-Addresses(X400:)
   X400Addr2 64 Secondary-Proxy-Addresses(X400:)
   ccMailAddr 64 Secondary-Proxy-Addresses(CCMAIL:)

   This process creates three new SMTP address fields with SMTPAddr1 being the
   primary SMTP address. Two new X.400 addresses with X400Addr1 being the
   primary and one new cc:Mail secondary proxy address.

4. Now that the fields have been defined, edit the mapping file by opening the
   file Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn\Dxamex\Mapnotes.tbl in a text editor.

   Some examples that correspond to the above fields would be:

   SMTPAddr1 = FirstName "." LastName "@exchange.microsoft.com"
   SMTPAddr2 = Left( FIrstName, "1") "." LastName "@microsoft.com"
   SMTPAddr3 = ShortName "@microsoft.com"
   X400Addr1 = "c=US;a=ATTMAILL;p=Exchange;g=" FirstName ";s=" LastName
   X400Addr2 = "c=US;a=ATTMAIL;p=Microsoft;o=Exchange;ou1=NOTES;g="
   FirstName ";s=" LastName
   ccMailAddr = Firstname "." Lastname " at Microsoft"

   After the Directory Synchronization process is complete, the addresses from
   above will appear on the Notes users as follows:

   SMTPAddr1 will be Firstname.Lastname@exchange.microsoft.com
   SMTPAddr2 will be F.Lastname@microsoft.com
   SMTPAddr3 will be user@microsoft.com
   X400Addr1 will be c=US;a=ATTMAIL;p=Exchange;g=Firstname;s=Lastname
   X400Addr2 will be
   c=us;a=ATTMAIL;p=Microsoft;o=Exchange;ou=Notes;g=Firstname;s=Lastname
   ccMailAddr will be Firstname.Lastname at Microsoft
