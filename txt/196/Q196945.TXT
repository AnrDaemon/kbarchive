TITLE   :Host Account Manager May Display User Password In Clear Text
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,4.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If a new user account is created using Windows NT User Manager and an SNA Server
host security domain is configured with "User ID is Mapped" and "Password is
Mapped", the Host Account Manager may display the new user's password if the
"Use Windows NT Password" radio button is clicked.

CAUSE
=====

When a new user is added to the host cache, the SNA Server Host Account Manager
normally indicates the user password as <Uninitialized>. However, when a
new user is added to Windows NT and password caching was configured, and the
password radio button is switched, the actual user password could appear in
clear text.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 4.0 and 4.0
Service Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
