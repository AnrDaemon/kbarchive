SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert an INCLUDETEXT field in a Microsoft Word document, the following
error message appears in place of the field results:

   Error! Cannot open file.

CAUSE
=====

When you manually insert an INCLUDETEXT field in your document, one of the
following may be causing the error message:

 - The file path has a space in the folder or file name.

   For example:

   {INCLUDETEXT c:\\my<space>documents\\test.doc}

   -or-

 - The file path does not include double-backslashes separating the folders
   and/or file name.

   For example:

   {INCLUDETEXT "c:\my documents\test.doc"}

RESOLUTION
==========

You must enclose the path and file name in quotation marks if there are spaces
in any part of the path or file name and you must use double-backslashes in the
path to separate the folder and/or file name in an INCLUDETEXT field.

For example:

   {INCLUDETEXT "C:\\My Documents\\Test.doc"}

   -or-

   {INCLUDETEXT C:\\Documents\\Word\\Test.doc}
