TITLE   :PU Passthru Connection Fails To Activate During XID Negotiation
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

PU Passthru connections to a remote end may stay in a pending status and not be
able to reactivate.

CAUSE
=====

When you use PU Passthru with Distributed Link Services, a window exists whereby
one of the remote ends can send an XID to the Node after the Node has sent it
the Open-Station-Request. This caused the Node to reject the
Open-Station-Response and Station-Contacted message, and thus fail to activate
either of the PU Passthru Connections.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 4.0 Service
Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
