SYMPTOMS
========

When using Visual Basic for Applications, if you use the Shell command to run an
MS-DOS program, the MS-DOS box remains on the screen, and you must manually
close the box.

CAUSE
=====

The Close On Exit property is not set for the MS-DOS window.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.

Method 1
--------

1. Start the MS-DOS Prompt (click the Start button, point to Programs, and then
   click MS-DOS Prompt).

2. On the toolbar, click Properties.

3. On the Program tab, click to select the Close On Exit check box, and then
   click OK.

Method 2
--------

Start the program using the MS-DOS command interpreter, Command.com, with the /C
switch. This switch closes the window after the program quits. For example, to
run a batch file, use the following command:

   Shell "command.com /c example.bat"

The following example VBA code closes the window after the batch command
executes:
