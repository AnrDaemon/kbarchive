KEYWORDS:winword word97

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Case 1
------

Large spaces appear between paragraphs, so that the first line of text appears at
the top of the page, and the last line of text is at the bottom of the page.

Case 2
------

A large white space appears at the top of the page, and the text adjusts itself
on the page beginning at the center of the page.

CAUSE
=====

Case 1
------

Vertical alignment is set to Justified. By design, Word evenly places the text
between the top and bottom margins of the page. In other words, the first line
of text on a page appears at the top margin, and the last line of text appears
at the bottom margin.

Case 2
------

Vertical alignment is set to Centered. By design, Word centers the text between
the top and bottom margins. In other words, a single line of text appears in the
center of the page. As you add more lines of text, all text is centered between
the top and bottom margins.

WORKAROUND
==========

Remove the Justified or Centered vertical alignment. To do this, follow these
steps:

1. On the File menu, click Page Setup.

2. Select the Layout tab.

3. In the "Vertical alignment" list, select Top.

4. In the "Apply to" list, select "Whole document".

5. Click OK.
