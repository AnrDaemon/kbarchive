======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article shows how to terminate or quit a running Visual FoxPro for
Macintosh executable from another application using AppleScript.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Normally you would use AppleScript to call the Quit command from the File menu
to close the application. When you run a distributed Visual FoxPro application,
the Quit option on the File menu is not available. However, most distributed
Visual FoxPro applications do contain a READ EVENTS in the code to start event
processing and prevent Visual FoxPro from exiting prematurely. The AppleScript
example is based on using a CLEAR EVENTS to cause the executable to exit.

NOTE: This example creates an AppleScript that you can execute from the Macintosh
Finder or another application that can run AppleScript.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Visual FoxPro for the Macintosh executable that either has a READ
   EVENTS in a menu or form.

2. Open the AppleScript Editor and type in the following test:

         Tell Application "VFP Support Library PPC"
            Do Script "Clear Events"
         End Tell

3. Save the script and call it "Quit VFP EXE". In the Kind option of the Save
   Script as dialog box, choose Application. You may also want to select the
   Never Show Startup Screen check box. Quit the Script Editor.

4. Close Visual FoxPro. Run the Visual FoxPro for the Macintosh executable from
   the Finder.

5. At the Finder, double-click the "Quit VFP EXE" Application script. The
   executable closes.
