SUMMARY
=======

When using Microsoft Cluster Server version 1.0, NTFS file/directory auditing on
a shared disk resource will stop recording file system access after the disk
resource is failed over to the other node. If the disk resource fails back to
the original node where auditing was configured, it logs information correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Auditing NTFS files and directories is set up both at the system level and the
file system level. The configuration set in Explorer resides on the volume in
question, but the system level configuration set in User Manager is stored in
the local system registry and is not replicated between the Cluster nodes.

To turn this feature on, follow these steps:

1. Go to each node in the cluster and run User Manager.

2. On the Policies menu, select Audit.

3. Click to select Audit These Events and then click to select one or both of
   the Success and Failure check boxes for File and Object Access.

Audit settings remain and are viewable from Explorer.exe, from either node,
providing that the node doing the viewing owns the drive and has it mounted
(online).
