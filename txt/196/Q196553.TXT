choose Page Setup from the File menu, and then select the Layout tab.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Suppress Endnotes option prevents endnotes from being printed at the end of
a section; however, with this setting selected, the endnotes are printed at the
end of the document. To select the Suppress Endnotes option, follow these
steps:

1. On the Insert menu, click Footnote.

2. In the Insert box, click the Endnote button.

3. Click Options and select the All Endnotes tab.

4. In the Place At box, select "End of section."

5. Click OK.

6. Click OK or Close if you do not want to insert a footnote or an endnote.

7. Click Page Setup on the File menu, select the Layout tab, and then select the
   Suppress Endnotes check box.

Note that default behavior for Word is to print endnotes at the end of the
document.
