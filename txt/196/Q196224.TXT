TITLE   :SMS: STOP 1E Error When Using the "Gold Key" to Remote Control
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbRemote kbsms120bug kbHelpDesk kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Some systems will generate a Windows NT blue screen error message with a STOP 1E
(0x0000001E) when the Quick Viewer "gold key" is used to generate a
"CTRL+ALT+DEL" sequence through Systems Management Server Remote Control.

CAUSE
=====

This problem appears to be the same as that described in the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q164157 SMS: Kbstuff.sys May Cause a STOP 1E Blue Screen Error

However, a different code path is being taken, so the error checking included in
that code fix is not used.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
