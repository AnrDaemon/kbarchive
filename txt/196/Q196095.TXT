PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:Windows:95,98;WinNT:4.0,4.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server versions 4.0, 4.0a 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you run the Small Business Server (SBS) Client Setup Disk on a computer
running Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows NT Workstation 4.0 and then restart
the computer, the SBS Client Application installation program does not continue
after the initial logon screen and finish the applications install.

The logged on user does get a logon script, and has full connectivity to the SBS
server as determined by permissions set during User Setup Wizard.

Shortcuts appear on desktop and are available.

CAUSE
=====

The cause for this problem can be any of the following:

 - The computer was a client to another SBS domain at some time.

 - The client setup installation was previously stopped.

 - There was a corrupted log file during setup.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do the following:

1. Locate and delete the following LOG file:

   c:\startcli.log

2. Restart the client computer.

3. If the SBS Client Installation does not continue when logging on, click
   Start, click Run, and type the following line:

   \\<ServerName>\clients\setup\<ClientType>\startcli.exe

   Replace <ServerName> with the name of your SBS Server.

   Replace <ClientType> with i386 for Windows NT Workstation clients and
   win95 for Windoes 95 or Windows 98 clients.

4. Click OK.
