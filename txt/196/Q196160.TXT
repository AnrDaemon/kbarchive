TITLE   :XWEB: Contacts Information Not Available When Using OWA
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) with the option to use Schedule+
as your primary calendar, you can no longer open your Contacts folder. When you
disable the option to use Schedule+ as your primary calendar, the Contacts
folder becomes viewable again.

To enable this option, on the Tools menu, click Options, and then select the "Use
Microsoft Schedule+ as my primary calendar" check box.

CAUSE
=====

OWA assumes that you manage your contacts information using Schedule+ when you
enable the option to use Schedule+ as your primary calendar. OWA has no method
of opening the contacts information you have created in Schedule+. This is by
design.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you must first import your Schedule+ contacts into
Outlook. For additional information about converting your contacts, click the

After you import the contact information, be sure not to use Schedule+ as your
primary calendar.
