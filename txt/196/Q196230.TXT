TITLE   :SLI Does Not Reset Lua_flag2.async
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,4.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If an SLI application issues an SLI verb and has the Lua_flag2.async parameter
set to 1, and the verb completes synchronously (for example, because of an
error), the SLI library does not reset Lua_flag2.async to zero (indicating the
verb completed synchronously). The results of this will depend on the SLI
application, but this could cause various application problems.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 4.0 and 4.0
Service Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
