TITLE   :PRB: VSSVer.scc Added to FrontPage Web

KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbFrontPage kbSSafe600 kbInetDev kbFrontPage97 kbFrontPage98

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add a FrontPage Web to source control or recalculate hyperlinks on an
existing source controlled Web, the file VSSVer.scc is added to the Web. If the
Web has subfolders, the file also exists in the subfolders.

CAUSE
=====

Visual SourceSafe version 6.0 creates the VSSVer.scc file in a project's working
folder every time you perform a Get or Check Out operation. When you add a new
Web to Visual SourceSafe or recalculate hyperlinks on an existing Web, Visual
SourceSafe performs a Get on the files in the Web. The working folder for the
Visual SourceSafe project is the location of the files on the Web server, so the
VSSVer.scc file is created in that folder. FrontPage looks at all the files in
that working folder, assumes that they belong to the Web, and adds them to
FrontPage Explorer.

RESOLUTION
==========

The purpose of the VSSVer.scc file is to improve the performance of Visual
SourceSafe operations. Its presence does not impact the FrontPage Web, so you
can leave the file as is. You can delete the file from the Web, but it will be
recreated every time you recalculate hyperlinks.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
