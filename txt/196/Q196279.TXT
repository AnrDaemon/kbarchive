SYMPTOMS
========

When you add a project to Visual SourceSafe from one of the applications that
Visual SourceSafe integrates with, you receive the following error message:

   File or Project not Found.

CAUSE
=====

Some of the files that you are trying to add are in a subdirectory of the home
directory (the home directory is the one that contains the .vbp, .dsp, or .pjx
file), and project security is turned on.

RESOLUTION
==========

Turn off project security by clearing the Enable Project Security check box in
the Admin program. To do this, open the Visual SourceSafe Administrator, go to
the Tools menu, click Options, click the Project Security tab, and clear the
Enable Project Security check box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual SourceSafe 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Only the Administrator of the Visual SourceSafe database has permission to turn
project security on or off.
