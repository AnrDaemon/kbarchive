TITLE   :WD97: "Blue Background, White Text" Option Makes Text Disappear
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Black text on a white background may become invisible when the "Blue background,
white text" option is selected. For example, this problem may occur when you
have text typed in a text box.

The text is visible in print preview but not in normal or page layout views;
however, the text prints correctly, as shown in print preview.

CAUSE
=====

By default, the background shading (fill color) of text boxes is white. When
"Blue background, white text" is selected, text contained in a text box is also
displayed as white; therefore, the text is not visible against the white fill
color of the text box.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use any of the following methods.

Method 1: Set the Text Box Fill Color to No Fill
------------------------------------------------

1. Select the text box.

2. On the Format menu, click Text Box.

3. On the Colors And Lines tab, under Fill, change the Color box to No Fill, and
   then click OK.

Method 2: Clear the "Blue Background, White Text" Option
--------------------------------------------------------

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. On the General tab, click to clear the "Blue background, white text" check
   box.

3. Click OK.

Method 3: Change the Font Color to Black
----------------------------------------

To use a font color other than white, follow these steps:

1. Select the text that is not visible in "Blue background, white text" mode.

2. On the Format menu, click Font.

3. On the Color list, select Black (instead of Auto).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "Blue background, white text" option changes the background color of the
document to blue and changes the text color to white. Some users find this
setting to be easier to read than the default setting (black text on a white
background).

In addition, if you choose the General tab in the Options dialog box on the Tools
menu and select the "Blue background, white text" option, you may have
difficulty seeing the green underlining for items flagged as grammar issues.

Currently there is no option for changing the color of underlined grammar flagged
text in Word 97.
