-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

It is possible to get an access violation when trying to add a remote Advanced
Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) logical unit (LU) using the same alias
as an already existing remote APPC LU on the same connection.

Microsoft SNA Server Manager will first give a warning message in a dialog box:

   The LU Alias has already been use. The LU Alias cannot be the same as any
   other APPC LU on its connection.

After you click OK to get rid of that dialog box, and then click OK on the Remote
APPC LU Properties dialog box, an Application Error in Snaexp.exe may occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, and 4.0 SP1. We are researching this problem in SNA
Server version 3.0 and will post more information here in the Knowledge Base as
it becomes available.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
