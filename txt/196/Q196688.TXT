TITLE   :XADM: Move Server Wizard Does Not Warn of Encrypted Mail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Move Server Wizard will not warn the administrator that there is encrypted
mail remaining on the Exchange Server computer. This article summarizes the
possible affects of not decrypting all messages in the mailboxes being moved.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because encryption is done by the client, the Move Server Wizard is not able to
determine if encrypted mail exists on the client, and because the keys are
stored on the client, there is NO loss of keys. What is lost, however, is the
ability to recover a key if the mailbox is re-enrolled in advanced security
after the move. Therefore, to prevent the possible loss of a key in the future,
users should decrypt their mail before the move. This is necessary because the
process of issuing a new key will overwrite any old key, thus losing the old
key. It is recommended that decryption be done before the move process begins,
however, as long as the items are decrypted before the user is re-enrolled, then
the user(s) will not lose mail.

The Move Server Wizard's documentation should be read and understood thoroughly
before proceeding with the process. An "I Understand" tab has been added to flag
the importance of the wizard's documentation, so it should not be clicked until
all documentation has been read and understood.
