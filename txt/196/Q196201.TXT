SUMMARY
=======

Although applications that are written with Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 can run
on Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition, Microsoft Visual Basic has not been
tested and is not officially supported when running in a Microsoft Windows NT
4.0 Terminal Server client session. Therefore, any application that is written
with Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 is also not officially supported when running in
a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server client session.

The System Requirements for Visual Basic 6.0 are "Microsoft Windows 95 or later,
or Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0 (Service Pack 3 recommended) or later."
Visual Studio 6.0 is supported on Windows 2000 Terminal Server.

The System Requirements for Visual Basic 5.0 are "Microsoft Windows 95 or later,
or Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0 (Service Pack 2 recommended) or later,
or Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 3.51 with Service Pack 5".

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server is a product that enables the Microsoft
Windows NT Server to act as a terminal server for multiple, simultaneous client
sessions. Although Microsoft Visual Basic may successfully install and run in a
terminal client, the behavior of the Visual Basic IDE (Integrated Development
Environment) in this environment is not guaranteed. Windows NT 4.0 Terminal
Server is not an officially supported platform for the Visual Basic product.

Different problems have been reported in this environment. For example, when you
attempt to invoke the Help system (either by pressing F1 or by selecting a Help
menu item), you will receive the following error message:

   Attempting to use an invalid help file
