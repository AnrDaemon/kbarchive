SYMPTOMS
========

Compare Documents does not recognize formatting changes as revisions to your
document. For example, changing the font or paragraph characteristics; applying
borders and shading; changing column formatting; and adding bullets, numbering,
or heading numbering are not identified with revision marks when you run Compare
Documents.

In addition, Compare Documents does not identify additions or deletions of
drawing objects, nor does it recognize changes to text within a text box.

STATUS
======

By design, Compare Documents recognizes text changes, such as additions or
deletions of text to your document, but Compare Documents does not mark
formatting changes you make to your text.

With regard to Compare Documents not recognizing the addition, deletion, or
alteration of drawing layer objects, Microsoft has confirmed this to be a
problem in the Microsoft products listed above.


Additional query words: compare version versions comparing compared comparison revise revised revision revisions marks
