 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot find or replace All Caps text. This problem occurs when you created
the uppercase text by one of the following methods:

 - You typed the uppercase text with the CAPS LOCK key on.

   -or-

 - You used the Change Case command on the Format menu to change the text to
   uppercase.

   -or-

 - You used SHIFT+F3 to change the case of your text.

CAUSE
=====

By design in Microsoft Word, when you search for uppercase text by selecting the
All Caps effect in the Find Font dialog box, only text you formatted with the
All Caps option is found. (To locate the All Caps option, click Font on the
Format menu, click the Font tab, and see All Caps under Effects.)

By design, All Caps formatting affects only lowercase characters. It does not
affect uppercase letters, numbers, punctuation, or other non-alphabetic
characters. All Caps formatting does not change the ASCII value of the
characters. By contrast, when you use the Change Case command, SHIFT+F3, or CAPS
LOCK, you are changing the case as well as the ASCII value of the characters.
Lowercase characters have different ASCII values than uppercase characters.

WORKAROUND
==========

Type the uppercase text you are searching for in the Find What box of the Find
or Replace dialog box, and click to select the Match Case check box. Do not
select All Caps.
