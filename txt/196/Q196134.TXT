-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Pack 1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


Favorites can be added to your Internet browser to allow a quick return to a
particular Universal Resource Locator (URL). When you use the Outlook Web Access
client, it may be desirable to add a Favorite to allow quick access to a public
folder. However, if you add a Public Folder to your Favorites, then change back
to the Inbox, and then try to access the Public Folder through the Favorites
list, it will not appear until you select the Refresh Page Address icon. This
behavior only occurs when creating the initial Favorite. Quitting the browser
and logging on to Outlook Web Access again will work correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
