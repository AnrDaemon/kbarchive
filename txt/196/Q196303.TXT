TITLE   :IIS Performance Is Slower on Multiprocessor Computers
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Internet Information Server 4.0 on multiprocessor computers,
performance may be slower than expected.

CAUSE
=====

A global lock that all multi-byte string functions use when they run is being
used by the Internet Information Server threads so that only one thread can
perform a multi-byte string operation at a time. If a large pool of threads
tries to use these functions, only one thread at a time can access the function,
and a lot of time is spent waiting for the lock to become available. This is
most evident on multiprocessor computers where the synchronization overhead and
number of threads is much higher.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
