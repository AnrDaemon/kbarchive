PRODUCT :Microsoft Developer Network
PROD/VER:winnt:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbHTMLHelp kbMSDN kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the MSDN Library asks you to specify the location of a CD-ROM and you
specify a network or shared drive, one of the following error messages appears:

   Hh : The program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down. If
   the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

   -or-

   hh.exe - Application Error : The instruction at "0x5d34543c" referenced
   memory at "0x0000000c". The memory could not be "read".

CAUSE
=====

Sometimes installing another version of the MSDN Library corrupts the
Hhcolreg.dat file. This has been known to happen more frequently when the MSDN
Library is installed from a network location.

RESOLUTION
==========
