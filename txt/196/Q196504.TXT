SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a symbol in a paragraph and refer to that paragraph with a
STYLEREF field, the symbol may not appear correctly in the STYLEREF field
result. Instead, it appears as a "(" symbol (opening parenthesis).

CAUSE
=====

This happens when you insert the symbol and specify any font other than Normal
text.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are three ways to make the symbol appear correctly in the STYLEREF field
result:

Method 1
--------

Insert the symbol without specifying a particular font. To do this, follow these
steps:

1. On the Insert menu, click Symbol.

2. In the Font box, select (normal text).

3. Select the symbol.

Method 2
--------

If the symbol is in the Special Characters list, use the shortcut keystroke to
insert the symbol.

Method 3
--------

With the insertion point in the paragraph you are referring to, hold down the ALT
key and type the four-digit ANSI code using the numeric keypad.
