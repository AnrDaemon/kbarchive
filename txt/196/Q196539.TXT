SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to add borders to calendars created with the Calendar
Wizard.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To add borders to a calendar, do the following after you run the Calendar
Wizard:

1. Convert the text into a table using these steps:

   a. Choose the Show/Hide button on the Standard toolbar.

   b. In page layout view, locate the text box that contains the tab- delimited
      days of the week, and highlight this text.

   c. On the Table menu, click Convert Text To Table.

   d. Under Separate Text At, select the Tabs option.

   e. Click OK.

2. Apply borders (or shading, or both). To border the entire table, follow these
   steps.

   NOTE: Word 97 automatically applies default borders when the text is converted
   to a table. You can use the steps below to modify these borders.

   a. Highlight the table. Click inside the table, and then on the Table menu,
      click Select Table.

   b. On the Format menu, click Borders And Shading.

   c. Select the border type you want, and click OK.

The calendars created when you use the Calendar Wizard contain a number of text
boxes. Some of these contain pictures or headings. One contains the days of the
month in a tab-delimited format.
