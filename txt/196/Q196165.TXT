The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After using the Microsoft Exchange Server Move Server Wizard to move a server,
Outlook 97 toolbars don't work correctly. If you click on any of the folders
displayed in the Outlook bar, the error message below is displayed in a dialog
box in the client:

   Unable to display folder. Folder no longer exists.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design in Outlook. If a folder's path changes, Outlook will not be
able to find it.

WORKAROUND
==========

Users with this problem will need to recreate their Outlook toolbar.
