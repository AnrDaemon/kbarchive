SYMPTOMS
========

The SUM formula field may update incorrectly if text exists in a cell of a row
or column when using one of the following predefined formula fields:

   =SUM(LEFT)
   =SUM(RIGHT)
   =SUM(BELOW)
   =SUM(ABOVE)

In the following table, the first and second rows update correctly. If the text
is in a cell immediately adjacent to the formula, the calculation updates
correctly.

   ---------------------------------------------------------
   |      1      |      2      |      3      | =SUM(LEFT)  |
   ---------------------------------------------------------
   |      1      |      2      |    TEXT     | =SUM(LEFT)  |
   ---------------------------------------------------------
   |      1      |    TEXT     |      3      | =SUM(LEFT)  |
   ---------------------------------------------------------

The third row produces an incorrect result, as shown in the table below.

   ---------------------------------------------------------
   |      1      |      2      |      3      |      6      |
   ---------------------------------------------------------
   |      1      |      2      |     TEXT    |      3      |
   ---------------------------------------------------------
   |      1      |    TEXT     |      3      |      3      |
   ---------------------------------------------------------

CAUSE
=====

By design, when the SUM function, using one of the predefined arguments (LEFT,
RIGHT, ABOVE, or BELOW), is interrupted by a text-filled cell in the table, it
performs the calculation up to that point. When the text-filled cell is
immediately adjacent to the formula, the SUM function begins looking at the
figures on the other side of the text.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.

Method 1
--------

Specify a range of cells in your formula, for example:

   {=sum(a1:c1)}

Method 2
--------

Specify a series of cells in your formula, for example:

   {=sum(a1,b1,c1)}

For more information about referencing cells in a table, click "Contents and
Index" on the Help menu, click the Index tab in Help, type the following text

   cell references

and then double-click the selected text to go to the "referencing cells in a
table" topic. If you are unable to find the information you need, ask the Office
Assistant.
