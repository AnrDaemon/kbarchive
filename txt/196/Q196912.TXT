SYMPTOMS
========

When using a formula or expression field to perform a calculation of a set of
numbers, you may receive the following error message

   !Syntax Error, xxx,xxx

where xxx represents the numbers in the argument.

This error occurs when two or more numbers are separated by a comma without a
space, and the second and subsequent numbers are three or more digits. For
example, the following expressions

   {=sum(123,123)}
   {=sum(123,123,123)}

will produce the following errors:

   !Syntax Error, 123,123

   !Syntax Error, 123,123,123

This behavior occurs when the formula field performs the following calculations:
SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, and PRODUCT.

If the expression contains a series of three or more numbers, the second number
is one or two digits, and each number is separated by a comma without a space,
your results will be inaccurate, and you will not get a syntax error. For
example, the following expression

   {=sum(1,22,222,222)}

will produce the following result:

   22,222,223

This behavior does not occur when you perform calculations based on table cell
references or when using bookmarks.

CAUSE
=====

When the comma is not followed by a space but is followed by three digits, Word
interprets the comma as being the thousands-place separator and treats the
argument as one number.

RESOLUTION
==========

Place a space immediately following the comma, so that your formula looks as
follows:

   {=SUM(123, 125)}

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
