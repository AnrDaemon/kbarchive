KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you migrate GroupWise users into Exchange Server, you may receive the
following error message:

   One GroupWise user did not grant sufficient access rights to the
   migration account.

   The user name has been recorded in the application event log.

When you review the application log, you find the following:

   Event ID: 4012
   Source:   MSExchangeMig
   Type:     Error
   Category: None

   Description:
   The following GroupWise users have not granted sufficient access rights
   to the migration account.

CAUSE
=====

The account being used to perform the migration does not have access to parse
the migrated private mail messages on the Windows NT Server computer.

WORKAROUND
==========

The account being used to migrate users must have permissions to access private
messages. During the migration wizard configuration, a dialog box appears
requiring a user ID. Enter the account that has permissions to the users'
private messages, or enter the user ID of the actual migrated user.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Documentation about migrating from Novell GroupWise can be found on the Exchange
Server 5.0 CD under Migrate\DOCS\Gwise.doc. Chapter 10, page 212, describes the
prerequisites of migrating GroupWise users.
