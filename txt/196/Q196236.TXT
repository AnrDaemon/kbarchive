Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Method 1:

1. Create a directory in your local hard drive, such as, C:\Test.

2. Create a .prg file and put the following program in the .prg file:

   LOCAL ln_OpenMainPrg, la_Version[1]

         *- Create a "Main.prg" programmatically.
         IF FILE("Main.prg")
            ln_OpenMainPrg = FOPEN("Main.prg", 12)
         ELSE
            ln_OpenMainPrg = FCREATE("Main.prg")
         ENDIF

         IF ln_OpenMainPrg < 0  && Check for error
            WAIT WINDOW NOWAIT "Cannot open or create output file"
         ELSE  && If no error, write to file
            =FWRITE(ln_OpenMainPrg, "? 'Hello, World!'")
         ENDIF
         =FCLOSE(ln_OpenMainPrg)  && Close file

         *- Create project and build the .exe programmatically.
         CREATE PROJECT Test NOWAIT NOSHOW
         MODIFY PROJECT Test NOWAIT
         Application.ActiveProject.Files.Add("Main.prg")
         BUILD EXE Test FROM Test

3. Save and run the .prg file.

4. While the Project Manager is still open, start the Setup Wizard.

5. Go through all the steps, and click Finish.

   RESULT: About three-quarters of the way through the building process, the
   "Error generating CAB file(s), Error code: 3" error message appears.

Method 2:

1. Run the Setup Wizard and have the disk images directory (chosen in step 3)
   point to the folder that you chose in step 1, Locate Files.

2. After the Setup Wizard finishes, start the Setup Wizard a second time,
   complete all the steps and click Finish.

   RESULT: The error occurs sometime during the compression process.
