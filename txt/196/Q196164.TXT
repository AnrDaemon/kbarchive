TITLE   :XADM: Move Server Wizard Disk Space Requirements are Incorrect
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The following error messages are received when running the Microsoft Exchange
Server Move Server Wizard extractor, Setupmvi.exe:

   Setup could not find a drive with 11780 KB free disk space to install
   the program. Please free up some space first and press RETRY or press
   CANCEL to exit setup.

   Extracting file failed. It is most likely caused by low memory (low disk
   space for swapping file) or corrupted Cabinet file.

Even if there is 11,780 KB of free disk space, the extract process will fail.

WORKAROUND
==========

This problem has been reported to development. Currently, the only workaround is
to free up enough disk space to meet the requirements listed below.

Correct Disk Space Requirements:

 - The extract process works with 11,796 KB free of disk space.

 - The full installation of the Move Server Wizard works with 24,018 KB free of
   disk space.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Move Server Wizard component
of Exchange Server 5.5.

Additional query words: msw free space
