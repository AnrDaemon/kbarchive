SYMPTOMS
========

A table in a Microsoft Word document collapses into a single column of text when
the document is saved in one of the following formats:

   Text Only
   Text Only with Line Breaks
   MS-DOS Text
   MS-DOS Text with Line Breaks

CAUSE
=====

A table row is actually a special case of sequential paragraphs, using Chr(7)
following the text's paragraph mark and Chr(13), as the end-of-cell and two of
them for end-of-row delimiters. When the file is saved as text, the export
routine strips the Chr(7) characters, leaving only the hard returns Chr(13).


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, use either of the following methods.

Method 1
--------

Save the document in Text With Layout format.

Method 2
--------

Convert the table to tab-delimited text before you save the file. To do this,
follow these steps:

1. Place the insertion point inside the first cell of the table.

2. On the Table menu, click Select Table.

3. On the Table menu, click Convert Table To Text.

4. Under the Separate Text With option, click Tabs.

5. Click OK.
