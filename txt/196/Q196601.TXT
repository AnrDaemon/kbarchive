TITLE   :PRB: DCOMCNFG Displays One Class Name For Each ActiveX Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDCOM kbSecurity kbServer kbVBp kbVBp500 kbVBp600 kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) Configuration Utility
(Dcomcnfg.exe), only one class for each ActiveX server appears in the list of
applications. This occurs even though an ActiveX server may contain several
classes, each of which is functioning correctly.

CAUSE
=====

DCOM provides server level security. All objects within a server share the same
security settings. Therefore, Dcomcnfg.exe only lists the first object (class)
for each ActiveX server registered.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new ActiveX .exe project in Microsoft Visual Basic. Class1 is
   created by default.

2. Add a second class to the project (Class2).

3. From the Project menu, choose Project Properties.

4. Click the Component tab, and then select Remote Server Files.

5. Save and compile the .exe.

6. Exit Microsoft Visual Basic.

7. From the Windows Start menu click Run and then execute Dcomcnfg.exe.

RESULTS: When DCOMCNFG launches, the ProgId of the first object (Class1) displays
in the server list. Class2 will not appear.
