If you select text before you open the Mark Index Entry dialog box, the selection
automatically appears in the Main Entry text box and you can click Mark All to
mark the entire document. When you do not select text before you open this
dialog box, Word does not search the entire document and marks only the current
position of the insertion point with the index entry when you click Mark.

RESOLUTION
==========

To make the Mark All button available, open the Mark Index Entry dialog box, and
then select the text while the dialog box is open. To do this, follow these
steps.

while the dialog is on the screen, you can click in the text area and continue
editing.

1. On the Insert menu, click Index and Tables, and then click Mark Entry. The
   selection appears in the Main Entry dialog box.

2. Click Mark All.
