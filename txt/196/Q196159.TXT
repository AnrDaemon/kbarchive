   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

The Exchange Directory Service might fail to start with error 2140 after a fatal
failure of the Exchange Server Move Server Wizard and the following event might
be logged in the event viewer:

   Event ID: 1002
   Source: MSExchangeDS
   Type: Error
   Category: Internal Processing
   Description:
   The Microsoft Exchange Server database, EDB, could not be initialized
   and returned error -1811. Unrecoverable error. The directory can't
   continue.

NOTE: This error might happen even if the dsadata directory is restored to the
state of before running the wizard.

CAUSE
=====

The registry is pointing to the wrong Directory for the Dir.edb file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, restore the registry. To do this, perform the
following steps:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Go to the mvsrvdata\archive folder (mvsrvdata is the directory that you chose
   to store the temporary files in while running the Move Server Wizard).

2. Double-click on Restore.reg to restore the registry.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Exchange Move Server Wizard creates a subfolder under the dsadata folder
called newdsa. It will store the new Dir.edb there while it is building it. It
will also modify the registry to point to the newdsa folder (The wizard will
backup the Exchange registry keys in the Restore.reg file). If the Wizard fails
before it starts modifying the Private Information Store, it should recover on
its own and restore the settings to what they were before running the wizard. In
the case of a catastrophic failure however, the recovery code will not run and
you might have to restore the server by performing the above steps.
