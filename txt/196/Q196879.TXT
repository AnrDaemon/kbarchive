TITLE   :WD97: Ampersand in File Name Not Included When Added to Menu
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you add a file name that contains an ampersand (&) to a menu in
Microsoft Word, the ampersand does not appear.

For example, a file named "Jack&Jill" appears as "JackJill" on the menu.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. The ampersand is used in a menu to designate which
character of the menu item name to underline. This underlined character is used
as a shortcut to choose the menu item when you use the keyboard.

WORKAROUND
==========

To display a file name that contains an ampersand, save the file with a second
ampersand in front of the first before you add the file name to your menu, for
example:

   Jack&&Jill

When you add this file name to a menu, the name appears correctly, as:

   Jack&Jill
