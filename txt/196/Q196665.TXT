TITLE   :XCON: MTA Could Route Messages Through Higher Costing Routes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA) can send a message
through higher costing route when multiple connectors are available.

CAUSE
=====

The MTA uses the final route in a list if retry timers are equal when choosing
routes across multiple gateways. In the customer-specific case, the higher
costing gateway happened to be lower in the list of currently active in the
"connect retry state" than the least costing one.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
