TITLE   :XADM: Move Server Fails if IP Address Used to Join Another Site
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Exchange Server Move Server Wizard and choose Join an
Existing Site, you are prompted for the name of an existing server in the
destination site. If you specify an IP address instead of a NetBIOS name, the
Move Server Wizard fails with the following error messages:

   Some replication operations were not completed. Directories will be
   updated during normal replication updates. In the meantime, some
   directory services may not start or may fail. To view details of the
   error, see the application event log in the Windows NT Event Viewer.

   Microsoft Exchange Move Server Wizard
   ID no. c1030b4b

   An error occurred. Your server has not been moved. Exchange Move Server
   will now attempt to restore your original settings. Error code:
   c1030b4b"

WORKAROUND
==========

The only workaround is to use the NetBIOS name to join sites, instead of using
an IP address.
