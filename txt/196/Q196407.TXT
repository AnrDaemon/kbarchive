TITLE   :XADM: Unwanted Reminders Appear After Using Move Server Wizard
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you run the Microsoft Exchange Server Move Server Wizard on a particular
server, some users may receive many reminders or notifications for meetings that
have already passed.

CAUSE
=====

As the Move Server Wizard is carrying out its cleanup tasks, it will access each
mailbox's private store and delete the Reminders folder. If this action fails,
the Event ID listed below will be displayed in the Windows NT Application Event
log. This user will also end up with unwanted reminders.

   Event ID: 9502
   Source: MSExchangeMvServer
   Type: Warning
   Category: General
   Description: Unable to completely cleanup mailbox
   '/o=Organization/ou=Site/cn=Recipients/cn=User'.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, move the user in question to another server in the
site. That user can then be moved back to the original server, if desired.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
