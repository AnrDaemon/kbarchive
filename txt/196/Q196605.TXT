KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the LU-LU test tool is run from SNA Server Manager, an event 96 (Local APPC
TP start failed) may be generated even though the test was successful.

CAUSE
=====

The LU-LU test program (Display.exe) issues a TP_START verb with a Local APPC LU
name of "LOCAL." If LOCAL is not an LU that is defined on the SNA server, an
event 96 will be logged.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, and 4.0 SP1. We are researching this problem in SNA
Server version 3.0 and will post more information here in the Knowledge Base as
it becomes available.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K


WORKAROUND
==========

This error is benign, and does not cause any functional problem with SNA Server,
nor does it create any traffic on the SNA network. It can be eliminated by
creating a local LU with the name "LOCAL."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
Service Pack 1, 3.0 Service Pack 2, 3.0 Service Pack 3, 4.0, and 4.0 Service
Pack 1.
