TITLE   :WD97: Cannot Drag from Word to Another Program
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to drag text or graphics from Microsoft Word to another program,
the selection does not move to the other program.

CAUSE
=====

The drag-and-drop feature works only if the destination program supports OLE
2.0. If the program supports an earlier version of OLE, or if it does not
support OLE at all, you cannot perform drag-and-drop editing between Word and
that program. If you try to drag a selection to a program that does not support
OLE 2.0, the operation does not occur.

The following Microsoft applications support OLE 2.0:

   Microsoft PowerPoint 4.0
   Microsoft Excel 5.0 and later for Windows and Macintosh
   Microsoft Word 6.0 and later for Windows and Macintosh

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is more obvious in Microsoft Word for Windows when a program does not support
OLE 2.0, because the pointer changes to a "not permitted" symbol when you drag
an object into a program that does not support OLE 2.0.
