SYMPTOMS
========

A memory leak may occur in SNA Server's host print service when it closes
connections to physical printers. This was observed while performing stress
tests on the host print service while simulating a network error to the
destination Windows NT printer. This problem may occur when using either 3270 or
5250 print emulation.

releasing memory that it allocated for an internal printer information
structure.
