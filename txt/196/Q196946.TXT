TITLE   :SNAOLEDB Fails with "Data conversion (DCONV.DLL) not found"
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,4.0,4.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
 - Microsoft OLE DB Provider for AS/400 and VSAM, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Attempts to initialize the SNA Server OLE DB Provider for AS/400 or VSAM
(SNAOLEDB) may fail with the following error message:

   Data conversion (DCONV.DLL) not found

This error may occur even though the Dconv.dll is present in the
<snaroot>\System directory.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server Dconv.dll is dependent upon the SNA Server version of Trnsdt.dll
which SNA Server installs into the <sna>\System directory. If IBM Client
Access is also installed on the computer, it installs its own version of
Trnsdt.dll which conflicts with the SNA Server version, causing Dconv.dll to
fail to initialize.

This problem may occur with any version of the SNAOLEDB driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

To solve the problem, rename the version of Trnsdt.dll located in the IBM Client
Access directory, if it is installed on the computer. Only the SNA Server
version of Trnsdt.dll should be present on the computer.

NOTE: Renaming the IBM version of Trnsdt.dll may cause IBM Client Access
applications to fail.

If there are no duplicate versions of Trnsdt.dll present on the computer, ensure
that there are no conflicting versions of these other dependent DLLs, and that
these are available in the system path:

Shipped with SNA Server:

   Snanls.dll
   Trnsdt.dll

These are shipped by Windows NT:

   Advapi32.dll
   Gdi32.dll
   Kernel32.dll
   Ntdll.dll
   Rpcrt4.dll
   User32.dll

This one is shipped by Windows NT and SNA Server, and may be redistributed by
other applications too:

   Msvcrt.dll
