SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a remote access server to transfer data over a null modem cable
between a multiple-processor computer and a singe-processor computer, you may
receive cyclical redundancy check (CRC) or data overrun error messages in
Dial-Up Monitor.

CAUSE
=====

The overruns were occurring because the internal buffers in the UART (FIFO's)
filled up before the interrupt was serviced and data was lost on the RS-232 bus.
Further debugging found that the serial interrupt is masked for longer than .087
ms by the IDE interrupts that were being serviced.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are a couple of settings in the registry that will allow the interrupts to
be serviced quicker, set RxFIFO to 1:
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Serial By default DMA is not enabled on
Windows NT. Once enabling DMA the problem was resolved. I was able to increase
the baud rate to 115k and transfer over 100 meg of data with no errors. Enabling
improves CPU utilization over standard PIO, increasing system usability while
IDE operations are in progress.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using PCI bus master DMA, the CPU has to service only a single interrupt that is
generated when the IDE command completes. This is compared to standard PIO,
where the CPU has to service an interrupt from the device, every time a block of
data becomes available to the host. Performance figures on a checked build
showed approximately 20 to 30 percent CPU utilization using DMA, versus
approximately 90 to 100 percent utilization during PIO transfers. Performance
figures for DMA on a free build are even better, showing single-digit
percentages in some cases. How to Obtain Dmacheck.exe for Windows NT [winnt] ID:
