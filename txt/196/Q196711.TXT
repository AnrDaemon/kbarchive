KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp600bug KbDBFDBC kbMDAC250

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you update a Microsoft Access table from Visual FoxPro using the Microsoft
Access ODBC Driver and the string value being updated is shorter than the actual
field width, extra spaces are added to the end of the string.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Using Microsoft Access create a database that has a table with the following
   structure:

      Field Name      Field Type
      --------------------------

      ID              AutoNumber
      Fld1            Text(10)
      Fld2            Text(10)

   Add some records to the table and then exit Microsoft Access.

2. Using the ODBC Manager, create an ODBC DataSource to the Microsoft Access
   table based on the Microsoft Access ODBC driver.

3. In Visual FoxPro, open a database and create a Remote View to the Microsoft
   Access table using the data source created in the step 2.

4. In the Visual FoxPro View Designer dialog box, choose the Fields tab and then
   select all of the fields. Click the Update Criteria tab, and then select ID
   as the key and set all the fields as updateable. Select the "Send SQL Update"
   option. Save and then close the view.

5. Open the view and add a record to it as follows:

         USE View1
         INSERT INTO View1 VALUES(7,'aaa','aaa')

6. Exit Visual FoxPro and then run Microsoft Access.

7. View the table in Microsoft Access, and select either fld1 or fld2 in a
   record you added from Visual FoxPro.

RESULTS: Note that extra blank spaces are added to the string entered in Fld1 and
Fld2, as in the following example:

   ('aaa ')
