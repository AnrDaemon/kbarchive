TITLE   :XADM: Edb.chk Does Not Move During Performance Optimization
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Edb.chk file is not moved after the Performance Optimizer is run.

CAUSE
=====

The Edb.chk file is created on the original installation drive in the
ExchSrvr\Mdbdata and ExchSrvr\Dsadata directories and is not moved with these
directories if optimized to another drive.

This is by design.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, the *.CHK file can be moved to another drive
manually. To do this, perform the following steps:

1. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program and retrieve the properties
   of the server object. To get to the server object in the Exchange Server
   Administrator program, click Organization, click Site, click Configuration,
   click Servers, click <server>, and then on the File menu, click
   Properties.

2. Click the 'Database Paths' tab.

3. To modify the location of the Edb.chk file for the information store, select
   the 'Information Store Working Path,' and then click Modify. Using the
   interface, select the drive letter and folder that the new Edb.chk file will
   be created in, and then click OK. To change location of the Edb.chk file for
   the directory, follow the above, but select the 'Directory Working Path'.

4. Click Apply. This will stop and start the relative services creating the new
   Edb.chk on the appropriate drive.
