network name resource. The administrator must then bring this group online by
performing the following steps:

1. Open the Cluster Administrator program.

2. Highlight the resource group that was created for Exchange Server.

3. On the File menu, click Bring Online.

For further information regarding clustering Microsoft Exchange Servers, please
