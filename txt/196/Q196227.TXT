TITLE   :SMS: Scandisk Delayed During Windows 9x Client Installation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server 2.0, Windows 95 or Windows 98 client computers
running Smsls.bat for the first time receive the following message if they are
also running Scandisk at logon (either through startup or as a scheduled task):

   

   ScanDisk has restarted 10 times because Windows or another program has
   been writing to this drive. Quitting some running programs may enable
   ScanDisk to finish sooner. Do you want to continue receiving this
   warning?

CAUSE
=====

Scandisk is attempting to inspect the hard drive before the Systems Management
Server client installation running in the background finishes.

This is a particular problem for older computers where it may take several
minutes for Systems Management Server client installation to complete. After the
Systems Management Server client installation finishes, Scandisk will complete.
