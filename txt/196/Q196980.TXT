TITLE   :WD97: MS LineDraw and Wingdings Not Converted to WordPerfect 5.x
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The following fonts may not be retained when you convert from Microsoft Word 97
to WordPerfect 5.x format.

   MS LineDraw
   Wingdings

CAUSE
=====

Characters and numbers formatted with the MS LineDraw font may convert to line
or underscore characters. This behavior is by design. Word uses the MS LineDraw
font to convert the line draw features of other programs, such as WordPerfect,
into Word.

Wingdings is converted to underscores and formatted with the Courier New or an
equivalent fixed-width, monospace font. This behavior is by design, because
there are no other decorative fonts that map exactly to the same characters in
the Wingdings font set.


WORKAROUND
==========

To retain formatting similar to the MS LineDraw font when converting to other
formats, use the Courier New font or another fixed-width, monospace font.

You can reapply the Wingdings font or a similar decorative font to the text after
importing the document into WordPerfect.
