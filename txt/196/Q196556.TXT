TITLE   :WD97: Text Won't Wrap Around Frame or Text Box in Header/Footer
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:word97 kbframe

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word, when you insert a frame or text box into a header or footer,
you cannot wrap the header and footer text around that object. Also, the frame
or text box may obscure or overwrite the header and footer text.

For example, this behavior occurs when you align the text on the left, insert an
object before the text, and then apply a frame to the object.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design, because if text could wrap in the header or footer
of a Word document, text in the main document would have to move out of the
way.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use any of the following methods:

 - Format the paragraph with an indent to offset the text to the left or right
   of the framed object.

   -or-

 - Insert a table into the header, and then place the graphic in one cell and
   the text in the other cell.

   -or-

 - Move the framed object to another location, away from the text.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you set the Wrapping Style of a text box in the header or footer to Tight (on
the Wrapping tab of the Format Text Box dialog box), the text box behaves as if
you set the Wrapping Style to Through. After style is set, you cannot change
this behavior.
