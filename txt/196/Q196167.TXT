TITLE   :XADM: Unable to Initialize Extension Data Attributes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Mailbox Cleanup Agent (MBClean) version 1.8 does not support remote
administration. If the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program is used
on a different server than the MBClean install server, you will receive the
following two errors trying to run MBClean.

   Unable to initialize Extension Data Attributes!

   An exception has occurred in an extension .DLL file. Contact your
   extension supplier. Microsoft Exchange Administrator ID no: c10312fb

MORE INFORMATION
================

MBClean version 1.8 does not support remote administration. Therefore, the
Exchange Server Administrator program must be connected to the same server that
MBClean is installed on to make any changes to its configuration. Although
MBClean can only be administrated from the install server, it will still clean
mailboxes on any server in the site.
