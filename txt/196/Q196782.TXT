SYMPTOMS

The WizardBar "Delete" command is available only for functions that do not
return void.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the ClassView pane to locate the function. Right-click the function, then
click Delete.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

WizardBar is a dockable toolbar that extends ClassView functionality by
"tracking" your keyboard focus. It accesses features from ClassWizard and
ClassView functions. You may select a class or function and navigate to its
declaration or definition. WizardBar also offers a Delete command to remove both
of a function's declaration and definition. However, this command does not
appear on the right-click context menu if the function returns void.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. From the File menu, click New; click the Projects tab and select MFC
   AppWizard (exe) from the Projects list. Give it a name and click OK; here it
   is called WizBug. Click Finish, then click OK to confirm and load the
   project.

2. Make the WizardBar visible: right-click any blank space in the menu region,
   and select WizardBar if it is not already checked.

3. Select CWizBugApp from the first WizardBar drop-down list.

4. Right-click in the WizardBar and select Add Member Function. In the Function
   Type field, type void. In the Function Name field, type MyFun. Click OK.

   NOTE: The WizBug.cpp file appears with the cursor at the beginning of MyFun's
   definition.

5. Right-click in the WizardBar.

   NOTE: There is no Delete command in the context menu.

6. In the WizardBar C++ Members drop-down list, select InitInstance.

7. Right-click in the WizardBar.

   NOTE: The Delete command now appears.

To verify the resolution:

1. Expand WizBug classes in the ClassView pane by clicking on the +.

2. Expand CWizBugApp in the ClassView pane.

3. Right-click MyFun. Click Delete. Click OK the confirmation dialog box.
