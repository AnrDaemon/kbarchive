SYMPTOMS
========

The MAX and MIN functions display incorrect results when calculating numbers in
a time format. For example, if you have the following column of numbers:

   0:11:30
   0:08:50
   0:02:01
   0:12:00

the MAX function, such as

      {=MAX(above)}

returns a result of 58; the MIN function

      {=MIN(above)}

returns a result of 3.

These incorrect results also occur when you use the SUM formula, and you bookmark
the times and reference the bookmark names in your formula.

CAUSE
=====

Word interprets the colon as an operator for addition. In the above example,
Word first adds 11 and 30, 8 and 50, 2 and 1, and 12 and 0. This computes to 41,
58, 3, and 12. The highest or MAX value equals 58; the lowest or MIN value
equals 3. The SUM formula gives you the result of 114.
