SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Word provides a way to type international characters that contain a
grave (`), acute ('), circumflex (^), umlaut (:), or tilde (~) directly from
your keyboard.

For example, the following are some of the characters that can be typed with an
accent directly from your keyboard:

   
   A a E e I i O o U u Y y

NOTE: The names of the various accents may be different depending upon your
language.

For more information about typing international characters, click "Contents and
Index" on the Help menu, click the Index tab in Microsoft Word Help, type the
following text

   international

and then double-click the selected text to go to the "Type international
characters" topic. If you are unable to find the information you need, ask the
Office Assistant.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To type an accented international character, follow these steps:

1. While holding the CTRL key, type the character that will appear above the
   letter.

   NOTE: To add the tilde, colon, or caret character, press CTRL+SHIFT and then
   type the character that will appear above the letter.

   The status bar displays "CTRL+<key>" where <key> is the key that
   you pressed, but nothing appears on the screen.

2. Type the letter that you want. The accented character will appear in the
   document.

If you type a legitimate symbol and an ineligible letter, you hear a beep. If you
press CTRL plus a symbol that is invalid, you see just the character with no
symbol above it.
