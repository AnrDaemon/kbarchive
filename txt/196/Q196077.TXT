 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1

SYMPTOMS
========

If an attempt to make an SNARAS connection to a remote server occurs while the
SNA network is down (for example, a temporary outage), the remote access server
(RAS) port used for the unsuccessful connection becomes unavailable for further
use. If this pattern is repeated, eventually all SNA RAS ports become
unavailable, and RAS will report error 633, "Port Unavailable."

CAUSE
=====

SNARAS is not freeing up the RAS port after the unsuccessful dial-in attempt.

RESOLUTION
==========

--------------
