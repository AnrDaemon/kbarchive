-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word, a resized linked graphic may return to its original size when
you update it. This behavior occurs if you move the graphic to another directory
(folder) and then update the link by clicking Links on the Edit menu, changing
the source (that is, path), selecting Update Now, and clicking OK.

CAUSE
=====

When you change the path of the object after clicking Links on the Edit men,
Word replaces the original field code with a new field code, and the size
information is lost.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, manually change the path instead of updating the
location of the graphic by using the Edit Links command:

1. Select the linked graphic, and press SHIFT+F9 to view field codes.

2. In the field code, change the path to reflect the new location.

3. Press F9 to update the field.

4. Press SHIFT+F9 to turn off field codes.

The resized graphic will now appear correctly.
