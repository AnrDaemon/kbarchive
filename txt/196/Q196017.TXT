The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Pack 1 
 - Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 3.02, 4.0, 4.01, 4.01 Service Pack 1 for Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

After you log on to an Outlook Web Access (OWA) client and open a message with
an attached .avi or .wav file, the attachment generates the following error:

   Windows Media Player cannot open

   'https://red-01-
   http/exchange/Attach/read.asp?obj=00000000B6171E2FFD62CF11AC5800805F705D

   7406F825B175D2118FC800805F9F2EAC-cat.wav'.

   Please verify that the path and filename are correct and try again.
   (Error=8004406D)

This only occurs using Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player version
6.00.02.0902.

CAUSE
=====

Internet Explorer does not store the session cookie when requesting the URL for
the attachment. This causes a new session cookie to be generated when requesting
the file. Because this new cookie is from a non-authenticated user, javascript
code is returned rather than the attached file itself. Because Media Player does
not understand javascript, it generates the above error.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
