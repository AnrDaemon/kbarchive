======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server versions 4.0, 4.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

By default, on installation, the client installation disk for Small Business
Server (SBS) removes the Dial-Up Networking (DUN) component from Windows 95 and
Windows 98 clients. If a client wants to use a local modem or modem-sharing to
connect to an ISP for local use, dial-up networking will have to reinstalled.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 95 and Windows 98
-------------------------

Determine if dial-up networking is installed:

1. Click Start, click Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

3. Click the Windows Setup tab, click Communications, and then click Details.

4. Click to select the Dial-Up Networking check box, click OK, and then click OK
   in the Add/Remove Programs Properties dialog box.

5. You may then be prompted to insert your Windows 95/98 CD or enter a location
   for your source files.

6. After locating the appropriate files, you may be prompted to restart your
   computer. Do so at this time.

7. If you are NOT prompted to restart your computer, it is suggested you do so
   anyway.

Install Local Modem
-------------------

To install and use a local modem on a Windows 95 or Windows 98 computer, see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q142984 How to Install New Hardware in Windows

Install Remote Modem
--------------------

To install a modem that is shared on the Small Business Server computer:

1. Click Start, click Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Modems.

3. If no modem is currently installed, you will see the Install New Modem
   Wizard; allow the wizard to detect the modem.

   -or-

   If another modem is already installed you will see the Modem Properties dialog
   box. Click Add, and then allow the wizard to detect modem.

You can now configure dial-up networking to use a local modem (if installed) or
the shared modem from the server.

Special Considerations
----------------------

If you intend to use dial-up networking on a SBS client computer to connect to
another IP network, you will need to disable the WinSock Proxy Client in Control
Panel and then restart the computer before making a DUN connection to be able to
send and receive information properly.
