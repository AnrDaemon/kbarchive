PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kberrmsg kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 on a computer with LapLink 7.5 or
LapLink Professional by Traveling Software installed, Autochk.exe may stop
responding (hang) for approximately two minutes, and you may then receive the
following error message:

   STOP: c000021e (Cancel Timeout) The driver \driver\TSIKBFD failed to complete
   a cancelled I/O request in the allotted time.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because Autochk.exe generates keyboard read requests that
are not handled properly by Tsikbfd.sys, which is a LapLink keyboard filter
driver file. When Autochk.exe quits, it attempts to clean up the remaining
requests, but Tsikbfd.sys does not respond to the cancel requests.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, download the updated Tsikbfd.sys file from the
following Traveling Software Web site:
