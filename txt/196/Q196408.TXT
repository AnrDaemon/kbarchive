SYMPTOMS
========

If the Exchange Server computer that you are moving has mailboxes which are not
associated with a Windows NT account, then choosing to move the server to a new
organization and/or new site using the Move Server Wizard will result in the
following warning being displayed in the Windows NT Application Event log:

   Event ID: 9502
   Source: MSExchangeMvServer
   Type: Warning
   Category: General
   Description: Unable to completely cleanup mailbox
   '/o=Orgname/ou=Sitename/cn=Recipients/cn=Jane-92303-MB'

There is also a direct effect on performance. Each mailbox needs several seconds
to be processed during this phase.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Move Server Wizard of Exchange
Server version 5.5.
