The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Grammar and Spelling commands do not identify "that that" or "had had" as
repeated words. This behavior is different from that of earlier versions of
Microsoft Word.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design of Microsoft Word. The Grammar and Spelling commands
recognize that these two words can be repeated within a sentence. Although such
constructions are not grammatically correct in the strictest sense, they are
generally accepted in colloquial English.


Additional query words: repeat spell checker spelling that had grammar
