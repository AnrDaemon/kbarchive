SYMPTOMS
========

The description for Event ID 205 does not include the Source SAP information,
which makes it more difficult to determine where the conflict is. The current
description for this event is as follows:

   Outgoing call from connection <connection name> rejected because dest
   MAC address <remote network address> and SAP <remote SAP> are
   already in use by connection <connection name>.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 4.0
--------------

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 3.0, 3.0 Service Pack
1, 3.0 Service Pack 2, 3.0 Service Pack 3, and 4.0 Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The new Event ID 205 description has been corrected as follows;

   MessageId=205
   Severity=Warning
   Facility=Application
   SymbolicName=COM0205W
   Language=English

   Outgoing call from connection %1 rejected because destination MAC
   address (%2), destination SAP (0x%3) and source SAP (0x%4) are already
   in use by connection %5.

   EXPLANATION
   802.2 DLC Connections must have unique destination MAC, destination SAP
   and source SAP addresses.

   ACTION
   Reconfigure one of the SNA Server Connections to use a different
   destination MAC/SAP address or a different source SAP. If the link
   service is configured to use a fixed source SAP you can change the
   connection's source SAP only by configuring it to use a different link
   service.
