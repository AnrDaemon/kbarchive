SYMPTOMS
========

Severe memory leakage occurs when the SNMP agent is under stress.

Also, in Perfmon, for the Network Interface Object, you may notice a random
number for the first instance, instead of 1.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because, while processing messages, a buffer was used that
was never freed.


A regression in Service Pack 4 caused the network interface problem.

==========
