TITLE   :XCON: Multiple SMTP and NNTP Entries within Key Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You may find that there is more than one instance of either SMTP or NNTP
protocols within the Internet Information Service (IIS) Key Manager applet. The
existence of more than one of the same protocols suggests that the Windows NT
Option Pack has been installed on this computer. These multiple instances will
cause confusion as to which protocol to install a certificate against.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine which protocol to apply the certificate against, look at the icon
associated with it. If there are two SMTP protocols, the protocol that is
related to the Windows NT Option Pack will have an icon that resembles a mail
message. The protocol that is linked to Exchange Server will have an icon that
resembles a newspaper.

If there are two NNTP protocols, it isn't as easy to identify which protocol is
associated with which program because both are represented with a newspaper
icon. To determine which is which, in the Key Manager, select one of the NNTP
protocols, and on the Key menu, select Properties.

 - If the "Server Connection" dialog box is displayed, then this protocol is
   associated with Exchange Server.

 - If "Server Bindings" is displayed, this protocol is associated with the
   Windows NT Option Pack.

Even though there are multiple entries within the Key Manager, it doesn't mean
that both services are running. By default, only one instance of these services
can run at a time.
