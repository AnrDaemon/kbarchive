SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Word appears to sort items in the wrong order. Any named items that
contain numbers in their names, such as bookmarks, macros, or AutoText entries,
may appear to be sorted incorrectly.

For example, if you have three bookmarks named Test1, Test2, and Test11, they
appear in the Bookmark Name list in the following order:

   Test1
   Test11
   Test2

CAUSE
=====

Word sorts numbers in the same way that it sorts words, that is, one character
at a time. For example, Word places all numbers that begin with 1 (such as 12,
156, or 1147) before all numbers that begin with 2 (such as 22, 256, or 2276).
If two or more items begin with the same character, Word evaluates subsequent
characters in each item to determine which item should come first. For example,
Word places 124 before 19, based on the second digit (2 is less than 9, so 124
comes before 19).

WORKAROUND
==========

If you have named items that include numbers, change each name to include a
leading 0 (zero). If the Bookmark names are Test1 and Test2 (and one of the
items on the list has a two-digit number, like Test11), change the names to
Test01 and Test02. Word now sorts them in the expected order.
