SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to create the effect called "flush right" in
WordPerfect. In WordPerfect, the Flush Right command lines up some text in one
line with the left margin, and the rest of the text with the right margin. The
following is an example of this type of formatting:

   Chapter 4                                           Page 72
   text text text text text text text text text text text text
   text text text text text text text text text text text text
   text text text text text text text text text text text text

In Word, you can use a right-aligned tab or a two-column table to accomplish this
effect. A two-column table is the fastest way to align text in this fashion.

You can set the right-aligned tab manually, or you can create a macro to set the
tab automatically. If you use this type of formatting only occasionally, or if
you are interested in learning more about setting tabs, read the "Method 2: Set
the Right-Aligned Tab Manually" section of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To simulate the effect of the Flush Right command, use one of the following
methods.

Method 1: Create a Two-Column Table
-----------------------------------

1. Place the insertion point on the blank line where you want the text to
   appear.

2. On the Table menu, click Insert Table. In the Number of Columns box, type "2"
   (without the quotation marks). In the Number of Rows box, type "1" (without
   the quotation marks). Click OK.

   The table appears in the document. If you do not see the table, click
   Gridlines on the Table menu.

3. In the first column, type the text that you want to appear along the left
   margin.

4. Click the right column. On the Format menu, click Paragraph. On the Indents
   and Spacing tab, select Right on the Alignment drop-down list.

5. Type the text you want to appear along the right edge of the page.

Method 2: Set a Right-Aligned Tab Manually
------------------------------------------

1. Click the Show/Hide button on the Standard toolbar so that paragraph marks
   and spaces are visible.

   This makes it easier to see the tab mark when you insert it in step 4.

2. Click the View menu and make sure that Ruler is selected.

3. Type the text you want to appear along the left margin.

4. Press the TAB key.

   A small arrow (tab indicator) appears next to the text.

5. Move the pointer to the left edge of the ruler. A small black "L" symbol is
   in a small box. Click the box. Each time you click it, a different symbol
   appears. Each symbol represents a different type of tab. Click the box until
   a small backward "L" appears.

6. Move the pointer to the place on the ruler where you want the right edge of
   the text to appear. (Hint: It may be easiest to see this if you do not click
   all the way at the right edge of the ruler. Start a little way in from the
   right edge. You can easily drag the tab setting later.) Click the mouse
   button.

   A small backward "L" appears on the ruler.

7. Type the text that you want to appear at the right edge.

The text is now aligned along the left and right margins.

When you press ENTER to start a new paragraph, the new paragraph will have the
same tab setting.

NOTE: If you do not see the same tab setting when you press ENTER, you have the
WordPerfect options turned on. To disable these options, click Options on the
Tools menu, select the General tab, and clear the Help for WordPerfect Users and
the Navigation Keys for WordPerfect Users check boxes.
