TITLE   :PC MMTA: External Doesn't Automatically Restart with > 4 GB Vol
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the MS Mail Multitasking Message Transfer Agent (MMTA) External.exe
program against a large (greater than 4 GB) disk volume using the MinKDiskFull
and MinKDiskNotFull options, it stops when it falls below the specified "Disk
Full" limit. However, when it frees up space above the "Not Full" limit, it does
not automatically restart.

CAUSE
=====

The MMTA uses a data type of "32 bit unsigned long" for these parameters,
limiting it to 4 GB.

WORKAROUND
==========

Customers with this problem can run the MMTA against a smaller volume, thereby
avoiding reaching this size limit.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.5 of Microsoft Mail
Multitasking MMTA for Windows NT.
