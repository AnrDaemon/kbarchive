TITLE   :SMS: Site Component Manager May Fail When Polling
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In System Management Server 2.0, the Site Component Manager service (similar to
the Site Configuration Manager service in System Management Server 1.2) is
responsible for installing and removing services and thread components at a
Systems Management Server site. By default, the Systems Management Server site
and SMS database server are Component servers. However, there may be cases where
the Site Component Manager service fails to install theses components.
You may see the following error message in the Sitecomp.log file on the site
server:

   

   Polling multisite component server NCSMSSQL65..

      Installing server...
         Server's platform type is X86.
         Server is running Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 1.
         This version of SMS cannot be installed on machines running this
         operating system.
      Server installation failed and will be retried in the next polling
      cycle.

CAUSE
=====

This error message can appear in the Sitecomp.log file if the Systems Management
Server site server computer has Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 3 applied,
but the computer storing the SMS database does not.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, make sure the computer that is storing the SMS
database has Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 3 applied.
