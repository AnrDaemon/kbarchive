SYMPTOMS
========

When you update fields in a master document that contains cross- references, the
following error messages may occur in place of the cross-reference:

   Error! Reference source not found.

   Error! Bookmark not defined.

These errors also occur in a normal document if the document contains figures,
captions, pictures, or other cross-references.

CAUSE
=====

If you delete the cross-reference source or remove the subdocument that contains
it, Word for Windows can no longer locate the source and displays the above
error messages.

A cross-reference consists of a REF field that points to a special, internal
bookmark at the cross-reference source. As a result, the errors that occur refer
to REF field or bookmark problems.

For more information about the special bookmarks Word uses for cross- references,
indexes, and tables of contents, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q108455 Table of Contents Entries, Cross-References, & Captions Marked

   Q112542 Text Added to End of Line Not Included in Cross-Reference

MORE INFORMATION
================

In a master document, you can create cross-references between the master
document and a subdocument or between two subdocuments. If you insert, merge,
move, split, or create a subdocument that contains a cross-reference, Word
maintains the cross-reference as long as the REF field and cross-reference
bookmark remain intact.
