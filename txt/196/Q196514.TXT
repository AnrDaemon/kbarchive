TITLE   :WD97: Merge Results Blank Using Header File with ODBC
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:word97 kbmerge

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive blank results during a mail merge when the mail merge document
uses a header file and you have attached a database source file using ODBC.

For each record merged, you may receive the following message, where "x" is the
record number:

   One or more data fields in record x were truncated.

CAUSE
=====

ODBC architecture does not require a header file to perform a mail merge. The
elimination of header files ensures backward compatibility with Word version 2.0
for Windows mail merge files.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not attach a header file when you perform a mail merge using an ODBC driver;
remove any currently attached header file.
