TITLE   :XADM: Move Server Wizard Fails when System Folders are Present
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp1

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running the Exchange Server 5.5 Move Server Wizard, the following message
appears on the screen:

   System folders are homed on the server being moved. Rehome the system
   folders and run the wizard again.

CAUSE
=====

If the systems folders are homed on the server being moved, and there are no
replicas of the system folders on other servers in the site, this error will
occur. It will not occur if the server being moved is the last server in the
site.

WORKAROUND
==========

Add a replica of each system folder to another server in the site. Another
option is to rehome the system folders to another server in the site.
