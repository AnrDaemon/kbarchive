MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, if your query options are set up as follows

             Field:          Comparison:          Compare to:

             <field1>        is Blank             (empty)
   Or        <field2>        Equal to             (text)
   Or        <field3>        is Not Blank         (empty)
   Or        <field4>        Not Equal to         (text)
   Or        <field5>        Less than            (text)

and you modify the <field1> entry by selecting (none) from the Field list,
your query changes to this:

             <field2>        is Blank             (text)
   Or        <field3>        is Blank             (empty)
   Or        <field4>        is Blank             (text)
   Or        <field5>        is Blank             (text)

Your query should change to this:

             <field2>        Equal to             (text)
   Or        <field3>        is Not Blank         (empty)
   Or        <field4>        Not Equal to         (text)
   Or        <field5>        Less than            (text)
