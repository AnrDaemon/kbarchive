-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When configuring a Distributed Link Service (DLS), if you specify an invalid
resource for Remote Link Services such as \\Snasoga\Sample, you may observe that
connection hangs in Pending state with no reported events in the Event Viewer.

If an SNA Server internal trace is captured for the particular Remote Link
Service (SnaRemx) in question, it will show that remote link service received
the following error:

   "RPC failure, service not found."

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, and 4.0 SP1. We are researching this problem in SNA
Server version 3.0 and will post more information here in the Knowledge Base as
it becomes available.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following

MORE INFORMATION
================

After applying the update, an event will be logged in the Application Event Log
when this error occurs. The Remote Link Service will now report the failure, and
include an invalid link service name as in the following example:

   "Couldn't open distributed link service connection to remote link service
   \\<server>\<service> -- Remote link service not found."
