TITLE   :Assign LU Dialog Box May Not Show All Available Connections

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The "Assign LU..." dialog box that is displayed when assigning LUs to
Users/Groups or Pools may not list the first connection available in the SNA
Server subdomain. LUs that are configured on this connection are listed in the
"Assign LU..." dialog box.

Steps to Reproduce the Problem
------------------------------

1. Create a connection in SNA Server Manager with a name of "A" (without the
   quotes). This will insure that this is the first connection in the list.

2. Add a 3270 Display LU to this new connection.

3. Right click on a User/Group in the Configured Users folder, and select
   "Assign LUs..." from the pop-up dialog box.

4. The "Assign LU..." dialog box does not show connection "A" in the column that
   lists the available connections. However, the 3270 Display LU created in Step
   2 above is listed as an available LU that can be assigned to a User/Group.

NOTE: This also occurs in the "Assign LU..." dialog box that is displayed when
you select "Assign LUs..." after right-clicking on a Pool, if you are using SNA
Server 4.0 or later. Prior to SNA Server 4.0, the "Assign LUs..." option was not
available when right-clicking on a configured Pool.

RESOLUTION
==========
