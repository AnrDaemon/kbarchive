TITLE   :Computer Loses Network Connectivity
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Computers running Windows NT Server or Windows NT Workstation may lose network
connectivity. The computer is fully operational from the console, but it cannot
make network connections, be PINGed, or accessed across the network.

This behavior has been exhibited when Network Monitor is started from the console
or if Network Monitor is capturing the traffic in or out of this computer from
another computer.

CAUSE
=====

This problem has been experienced on computers with IBM token ring network
adapters using the driver with the following date and time stamp:

   Ibmtrp.sys   Tue May 21 15:31:12 1996

This problem happens when the Microsoft Network Monitor driver, Bhnt.sys,
attempts to place the token ring card in promiscuous mode.

The same behavior would occur when Performance Monitor is started locally or when
another computer remotely selects this computer as target.

RESOLUTION
==========

Contact IBM for the latest version of Ibmtrp.sys.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Both Network Monitor and Performance Monitor load Bhnt.sys when they are
started.
