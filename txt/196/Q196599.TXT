TITLE   :FIX: Visual SourceSafe Hangs With Recursive Get on $/ With Label
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbservicepack _IK kbSSafe600bug kbSSExplorer kbVS600sp2 kbVS600SP1 kbVS600sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Visual SourceSafe (VSS) hangs when performing a recursive GET of a labeled
version of the root project ($/).

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, select Options from the Tools menu in the Visual
SourceSafe (VSS) Explorer, and click the General tab. Select the "Act on
Projects Recursively" option (note that after changing this setting you must
exit the VSS Explorer for it to work on the command line). On the command line,
do not use the -r switch. Use wildcards in the command. For example, if the
command that is failing is as follows:

   ss get $/ -r -vlbeta1

use this:

   ss get $/*.* -vlbeta1

There is no workaround in the Visual SourceSafe Explorer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information
about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q194022 INFO: Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, What, Where, Why

   Q194295 HOWTO: Tell That Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs Are Installed

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem happens only when using a Visual SourceSafe 6.0 client accessing a
Visual SourceSafe 6.0-formatted database. If the database is in Visual
SourceSafe 5.0 format, the command line returns the error "version not found."
The same workaround can be applied.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Add a file to the root project.

2. Label the root project (for example, Label1).

3. At the command line, issue the following command:

   ss get $/ -r -vlLabel1

4. In the Visual SourceSafe Explorer, select the root project.

5. From the Tools menu, click Show History, and select the Include Labels check
   box in the Project History Options dialog box.

6. Select the label (for example, Label1) from the History.

7. Click Get.
