PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbmacro kbdta word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you click a button on a toolbar that has been copied from another template,
the button does nothing and no message appears.

CAUSE
=====

When you copy a toolbar from another template using the Organizer, Word does not
copy the macros associated with the toolbar buttons. When you click a button in
the new template, Word looks for the macro that goes with the button and cannot
find it.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the Organizer to copy the original template's macros.

The Organizer allows you to copy items from one template to another template,
from one document to another document, or from one document to a template. The
Organizer can copy styles, macros, toolbars, and AutoText.

To use the Organizer, on the Tools menu, point to Macro, click Macros, and then
click Organizer.
