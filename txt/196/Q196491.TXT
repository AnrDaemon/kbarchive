TITLE   :XADM: Attributes Not Available to LDAP Users with Admin Rights
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you configure the Attributes tab in the properties for the DS Site
Configuration object so that some attributes are not available to authenticated
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) requests, you are not able to
access those attributes even if you log on with a user account that has Admin or
View Only Admin rights. If you attempt to perform an LDAP operation (such as a
search or compare operation) that uses these attributes, the operation fails.
Note that this also applies to LDAP programs with permissions that are
equivalent to Admin or View Only Admin rights.

CAUSE
=====

When processing LDAP requests, the directory service does not distinguish
between authenticated users that have Admin or View Only Admin rights and
authenticated users that do not have these rights. If the DS Site Configuration
object is configured so that some attributes are not available to authenticated
LDAP requests, no authenticated users are able to access those attributes.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
