SUMMARY
=======

This article describes four methods for underlining form fields and extending
the underline to a fixed point.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Method 1: Create a Table That Resembles the Printed Form
--------------------------------------------------------

When you either insert or draw a table, it automatically has a border. If you
want the border to be only at certain places within your table, you first need
to remove the border. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Place your insertion point anywhere in the table.

2. On the Table menu, click Select Table.

3. On the Format menu, click Borders and Shading, and then select the Borders
   tab.

4. Under Setting, click None and then click OK.

   NOTE: You may see the gridlines of the table; however, they will not be
   printed.

5. Place the form field at an appropriate spot in the table.

Method 2: Set an Underlined Tab
-------------------------------

Set a left-aligned, underlined leader tab at the position where you will start
typing, and set a right-aligned, underlined leader tab at the position where the
underlining will end. Insert the form field between the two tabs and underline
the form field.

To set one of these tabs, follow these steps:

1. On the Format menu, click Tabs.

2. In the Tab Stop Position box, enter the place where you want the first tab to
   stop.

3. In the Alignment list, click Left.

4. In the Leader list, click 4.

5. Click Set.

6. In the Tab Stop Position box, enter the place where you want the second tab
   to stop.

7. In the Alignment list, click Right.

8. In the Leader list, click 4.

9. Click Set.

10. Click OK.

Method 3: Insert Nonbreaking Spaces
-----------------------------------

Unlike regular spaces, you can underline nonbreaking spaces.

1. Turn on display of nonprinting characters so that you can see the characters
   once you type them:

   a. On the Tools menu, click Options.

   b. Select the View tab.

   c. In the Nonprinting Characters category, click to select the All check box.

   d. Click OK.

2. Place the insertion point where you want the underline to begin.

3. Press CTRL+SHIFT+SPACEBAR for each space that you want to underline. Unlike
   regular spaces, which appear as dots, these nonbreaking spaces appear as
   small circles.

4. Highlight each nonbreaking space and click the Underline button on the
   Formatting toolbar or press CTRL+U.

5. Insert the form field in the center of the nonbreaking spaces to assure equal
   line space before and after the form field.

You can repeat steps 3 and 4 on the other side of the form field.

Method 4: Draw a Line
---------------------

Use the Drawing Toolbar to draw a line beneath the area to be underlined.

NOTE: Do not use this method in documents that are not protected, because users
may accidentally select and move the drawn lines.
