TITLE   :WD97: Sub Doc's Heading Numbering Doesn't Appear in Master Doc

SYMPTOMS
========

In a master document, Microsoft Word does not display subdocument heading
numbering.

Word displays the heading numbering if you open the subdocument as a separate
document, but when the subdocument is part of a master document, Word does not
display subdocument-level heading numbering.

CAUSE
=====

Word attaches the heading numbering format to the heading style. In a master
document, the style definition of the master document overrides that of the
subdocument, so if you do not apply heading numbering in the master document, it
does not apply to any of the subdocuments either.

The same is true for all styles that exist in both the subdocument and master
document: The style in the master document has priority over the same-name style
in the subdocument. For example, if the Normal style in your subdocument
contains Arial font formatting and the Normal style in your master document
contains Times New Roman, Word formats the subdocument for Times New Roman when
it is part of a master document.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, apply heading numbering for subdocuments from
within the master document.

STATUS
======

This functionality is by design. Allowing the master document to control the
styles makes the resulting combination of documents (master document and
subdocuments) more consistent in style. Applying direct formatting in the master
documents or subdocuments will override this functionality.
