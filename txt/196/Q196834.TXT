The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 to create an Active Document Container,
the toolbars associated with an Active Document Server that has lost focus may
not hide correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new MFC MDI Application with Active Document Container support.

2. Build and run the application.

3. Insert a new Visio Standard 5.0 object into an MDI child window.


4. Select New from the File menu to open another MDI child window.

RESULTS: Notice that the new MDI child window has focus and that the toolbars
associated with Visio are not hidden. The menu does change, but the toolbars
remain visible allowing the user to click on buttons that are not relevant for
the currently active window.
