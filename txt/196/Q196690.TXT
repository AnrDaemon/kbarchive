TITLE   :XADM: Failed to Traverse Mailboxes Using MBCLEAN on Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to run the Mailbox Cleanup Agent on an Exchange 5.5 Server
computer the user may receive the following message in the Windows NT
Application log:

   Event ID 722
   MSExchangeMCA
   Description:
   Failed to traverse mailbox's in container ORG~Site~Recipients - Mailbox:
   Mailboxname.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when the cleanup agent finds a mailbox that is no longer
accessible. For example, the mailbox was deleted but still exists in the
directory.

This has been shown to occur most of the time when a user runs Loadsim on the
Exchange Server computer and the Mailbox Cleanup Agent is run against one of the
containers it creates.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Mailbox Cleanup Agent of the
Microsoft Exchange Resource Kit. This has been addressed in version 5.0.1.91.0
of the Mailbox Cleanup Agent.
