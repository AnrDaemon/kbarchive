SYMPTOMS
========

Case 1
------

The index or table of contents in your master document begins with no number for
heading 1 style paragraphs.

Case 2
------

The index or table of contents does not include chapter numbering.

CAUSE
=====

Case 1
------

You specified chapter numbering in the subdocuments but not in the master
document.

Case 2
------

You specified chapter numbering in the master document but not in the
subdocuments.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around these problems, generate a table of contents or index that
includes the chapter number and begins with Chapter 1 instead of Chapter 0. To
do this, follow these steps:

1. In each of your subdocuments, number the headings. Use the Outline Numbering
   tab (click the Bullets and Numbering command on the Format menu).

2. Format the page numbers in each subdocument to include chapter numbers. (To
   locate the Chapter Numbers option, click Page Numbers on the Insert menu, and
   then click Format.)

3. In the master document, turn on Heading Numbering.
