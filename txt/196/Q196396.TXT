======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

An Exchange Server Administrator can use the Microsoft Windows NT Unicode
Character Map application to create Comma Separated Value (CSV) text files that
contain International characters.

The Unicode Character Map application uses the standard ANSI character set, which
is compatible with the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Importing CSV files, which were created using MS-DOS text and the IBM PC
Extended Character Set (ECS), will fail to create an object with the correct
International characters.
