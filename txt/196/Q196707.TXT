TITLE   :PRB: Windows NT 4.0 CHKDSK Refuses to Check NTFS 3.0/3.1 Volumes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a computer running Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 4 or later installed,
Chkdsk.exe may not attempt to process NTFS 3.0/3.1 partitions. The user receives
the following message that indicates that this version of Chkdsk.exe cannot be
used to check a volume:

   The type of file system is NTFS:
   This NTFS volume was created or modified by a later version of Windows NT.
   This version of chkdsk cannot be run on this volume. You must boot the
   version of NT that created/modified this volume and run chkdsk from that
   installation.

CAUSE
=====

New features of the NTFS 5.0 file system, which include disk quotas, encryption,
reparse points, sparse files, and the Update Sequence Number (USN) journal would
not be recognized by the Windows NT 4.0 version of Chkdsk.exe. Enabling the
Windows NT 4.0 version of chkdsk.exe to process the NTFS 3.0/3.1 volume could
result in volume corruption. Therefore, the version of Chkdsk.exe supplied with
Service Pack 4 has been modified to prevent the processing of NTFS volumes.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
