TITLE   :WD97: "Bookmark Not Defined" When Merging Document That Has TOC
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:word97 kbmerge

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform a mail merge to a new document and the main document contains a
table of contents or a table of figures, the following error message appears,
instead of page numbers, when you update the table:

   ERROR! Bookmark not defined

Indexes and tables of authorities are not affected by this problem.

This does not happen when you perform the mail merge directly to the printer.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use any of the following methods.

Method 1
--------

Unlink the table of contents before merging to a new document. This converts the
TOC field to actual text, and the table of contents can no longer be updated. If
you want to update the table of contents, you must reinsert it.

Follow these steps to unlink the table of contents:

1. Place the insertion point within the table of contents.

2. Press CTRL+SHIFT+F9.

Method 2
--------

Insert the table of contents after merging to the new document.

Method 3
--------

Merge directly to the printer, instead of merging to a new document.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The GOTO fields and PAGEREF fields that display the page numbers in the table of
contents remain linked after the merge, but the bookmarks they refer to are
unlinked and are no longer available.
