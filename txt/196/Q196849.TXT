TITLE   :XFOR: Internet Mail Service Attachment Formatting Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain circumstances, when you send messages containing multiple
attachments using the Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1 Internet Mail Service,
the messages may not arrive correctly formatted for an Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks recipient. This can occur when the e-mail is received by the Microsoft
Mail (PC) postoffice by means of third-party gateways that lack the ability to
handle Content-Location data correctly (RFC 2110).

When viewing the message, using the Exchange, Microsoft Mail (PC), or Outlook
client, the attachments are displayed as raw MIME in the body text, and cannot
be launched or accessed.

A message containing a single attachment arrives correctly formatted.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is attributable to new functionality, added to Exchange Server 5.5
Service Pack 1, to support Content-Location in the message body.
Content-Location is a proposed SMTP standard defined in RFC 2110.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
