TITLE   :XADM: Directory Service Stops When Upgrading to 5.5 or 5.5 SP1
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to upgrade to Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 or apply Exchange
Server 5.5 Service Pack 1, the Directory service may stop unexpectedly after the
"Setup is making sure the system is ready for installation" message is displayed
on the screen. When this occurs, the last line that appears in the Exchange
Server Setup log file may be similar to the following:

   Interpreting line <StopService:MSExchangeSA>

In addition, events similar to the following may appear in the event log:

   Event ID: 195
   Source: ESE97
   Description: MSExchangeDS ((456)) Internal trace: dir.cxx@2041

   Event ID: 15
   Source: MSExchangeES
   Description: Error 0x8004011d occurred while trying to run a timer-
   based agent.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when the Setup or Update program attempts to stop the
directory service while directory replication is being performed and the process
used to stop the service times out before directory replication is finished. The
Directory service cannot be stopped until directory replication is finished.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

later:

STATUS

version 5.5.
