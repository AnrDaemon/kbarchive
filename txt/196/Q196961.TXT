SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Word as your e-mail editor, Word does not create an AutoRecover
file of your e-mail message.

CAUSE
=====

The AutoRecover feature is available in Word; however, Word disables this
feature automatically when you use Word as your e-mail editor.

NOTE: To see the AutoRecover option in Word, click Options on the Tools menu, and
then click the Save tab.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you create a new e-mail message, most e-mail programs save the new message
automatically to your Inbox if you do not send it, or if the e-mail program
quits unexpectedly.
