TITLE   :WD97: Rulers Disappear with Selection Larger Than One Page
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word8 word97 kbtable

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you select all or part of a document and the selection extends over a page
break, the vertical and horizontal rulers may disappear. If you scroll to the
top or bottom of the selection, one or both of the rulers may reappear.

NOTE: This problem also occurs when you select a table and the table extends over
a page break.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs only in Page Layout view (on the View menu, click Page
Layout) and the selection is longer than one page. By design, the Word
horizontal ruler displays the settings for the last paragraph in a selection.
(If nothing is selected, Word displays the settings for the paragraph where the
insertion point is located.) Similarly, Word displays the vertical ruler only
for the page where the selection ends (or where the insertion point is located).
