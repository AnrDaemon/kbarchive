SUMMARY

When a user sends a "reply to all" using a message that was received before a
server move, the user receives a copy of the reply. This applies only to users
whose Microsoft Exchange Server computer was moved using the Move Server Wizard.
Users will not receive copies when they send "reply to all" messages using mail
received after the move.
