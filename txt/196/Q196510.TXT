PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kberrmsg kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to a local printer, you may receive the following error message:

   Error writing to LPT1 <file name>: The system cannot find the file
   specified.

Also, the Parallel device driver may not start and you may see the following
event in Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 3
   Source: Parallel
   Type: Error
   Category: None
   Description:  Not enough memory was available to allocate internal
   storage needed for the device.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the third-party BasJdrv device driver starts when
Windows NT is started.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, disable the BasJdrv device driver by following
these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Devices.

3. In the list of devices, click BasJdrv, click Stop, click Startup, click
   Disabled, click OK, and then click Close.

4. Restart your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is caused by installing the Xilinx M1.3 JTAG Programmer software.
This software installs the BasJdrv.sys driver, which accesses the parallel port
and conflicts with the printer driver. For more information about Xilinx
software, visit the following Xilinx Web site:
