SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how you can use data from a Word form as the data source
for a mail merge operation.

NOTE: You cannot use a protected form document as a mail merge main document. In
fact, the Mail Merge command on the Tools menu is unavailable when a protected
form is the active document.

Using Form Data as Mail Merge Data Source
-----------------------------------------

In a protected form, you can save the data only, in comma-delimited text-file
format. You can use this text file as a data document in a Word mail merge, or
you can add it to an existing data document. To save only the data, do the
following:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. Click the Save tab.

3. Click to select the "Save Data Only for Forms" check box, and then click OK.

4. Fill out your protected form.

5. On the File menu, click Save Copy As. Word proposes the same name as your
   form document, with a .txt extension. Word automatically selects Text Only in
   the "Save As Type box". Type a new file name or click Save to accept the
   default name.
