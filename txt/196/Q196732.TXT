   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

When a user connects to a Terminal Server computer in a client session, he or
she may be locked down to only one application. If this application does not
allow for selecting the default printer, the user will not be able to specify a
printer other than the default. To make it possible for all users to specify the
printer closest to them, the default printer must be set using a regini script.

NOTE: Regini.exe is available in the Windows NT Resource Kit.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. In Terminal Server, run Regedt32 and go to the following key:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/WindowsNT/Currentversion/Devices

   Here you will see a list of your existing printers. An example of one of the
   key values may look like this:

   HP LaserJet 5Si : REG_SZ: winspool,Ne00

   NOTE: This is a local printer, NOT a network printer.

   The first text string is the text name of the printer, and the last two
   numbers in Ne00 will be the order in which the printer was added to the
   server for a TCP/IP printer. It could be, for example, LPT1: for a direct
   connected printer. Take note of all the printers listed here. These printer
   would have had to been installed by a local administrator.

2. Create a text file and name it SomeFileName.ini. One of theses files will be
   needed for each printer you need to assign as default. The file should look
   like this:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows
      Device = DELETE

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Printers
      DeviceOld = DELETE

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows
      Device = "[text name of printer],winspool,Nexx:"

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Printers
      DeviceOld = "[text name of printer],winspool,Nexx:"

   NOTE: Do not forget the colon (:).

   NOTE: xx is the Ne number for the specific printer you would like to use with
   this file.

   NOTE: Device = "[text name of printer],winspool,Nexx:" is case sensitive.

3. After all your files have been created for each printer, you must add the
   following line to the logon script of each user:

   regini [path]\SomeFileName.ini > Nul:

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, only printers that are attached to a local port on the server will
be pushed to all users logging on to the Terminal Server computer. This includes
printers connected through TCP/IP printing.
