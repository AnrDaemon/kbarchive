TITLE   :WD97: Cannot Rename Normal.dot If Word Mail Is Running
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to rename the Normal template while Word Mail is running, you
receive the following error message:

   Cannot rename Normal: Access is denied.

   Make sure the disk is not full or write-protected and that the file is not
   currently in use.

CAUSE
=====

When you compose a mail message, a session of Microsoft Word is opened in the
background. When Word is active, it uses the Normal template and creates a
temporary file for Normal.dot; therefore, you cannot rename the file.

This behavior is by design of Microsoft Word.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, send your mail message and close Word before you
rename the Normal template.

NOTE: You may also have to close Outlook or Exchange so that the Normal.dot
temporary file is closed.
