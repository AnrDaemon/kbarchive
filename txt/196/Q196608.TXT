The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When using the HP4000 and other PCL5-type printers, Paper Drawer options are
only available for the HP printer driver that is being used on the AS/400 when
using HPT (Host Print Transform). If the specific AS/400 printer driver is not
available for the particular printer being used, then those drawers will only be
accessible using Drawer Redirection on the IBM AS/400.

MORE INFORMATION
================

At this time IBM states that they do not directly support the HP4000 using HPT
(Host Print Transform) by offering a specific driver for this type of printer.
However, they do offer a technical document that will allow "Workstation
Customizing Object Modifications" to redirect to these additional drawers using
control strings. See IBM AS/400 Support Line Technical Document 8692422 for more
information.

The third-party products discussed here are manufactured by vendors independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
