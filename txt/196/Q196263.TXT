PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you double-click Network Neighborhood to view a list of computers on your
network, the list of Novell NetWare servers may be incomplete.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you have Microsoft Gateway (and Client) Services for
NetWare (GSNW) installed and your computer is configured for automatic frame
detection. NetWare servers are explicitly configured to use either Ethernet
802.2 or 802.3 frames. Reception of multiple frame types is disabled in Windows
NT when you choose automatic frame detection.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, configure your computer to use multiple frame types. To
do so, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

   Q138699 Configuring Windows NT Workstation for Multiple Frame Types

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
