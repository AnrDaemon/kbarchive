======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A Common Programming Interface for Communications (CPIC) application may produce
event 3017: CPI-C conversation_ID unknown, in the Windows NT application event
log. The CPIC application appears to be working fine, but this error may be
produced every time the application is called.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The application sends data to the host. After the application has finished
sending the data, it changes the direction by issuing Receive verb. The host
responds by returning data to the client AND deallocating the session. This can
be seen in the node message trace snippet below:

    ----------------------------------------------- 14:30:51.0031
    05160002->01020101 DLC DATA
                       DAF:02 OAF:02 ODAI:on  Normal
                       RQE FMD EC DR1 CEB

The CEB indicates that the host no longer cares about any conversation related
matters. When the client receives this chunk of data, you need to inspect the
return code on the verb. In this case, it's a CM_DEALLOCATED_NORMAL, which means
the conversation has been deallocated normally, and no longer exists.

The application then issues a Deallocate verb as shown below:

    ----------------------------------------------- 14:30:51.0062
    CMDEAL request
     Conversation ID = 01000000
    Conversation characteristics
     Deallocate type = CM_DEALLOCATE_SYNC_LEVEL
     Log data pointer = 00000000
     Log data length = 0

The SNA Server, appropriately, responds with a Parameter Check because the
conversation no longer exist, as shown below:

    ----------------------------------------------- 14:30:51.0062
    CMDEAL response, result = CM_PROGRAM_PARAMETER_CHECK

Summary of the Parameter Check
------------------------------

The application does not need to issue the CMDEAL CPIC verb.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the application so it does not include the CMDEAL, and the event 3017s
should stop.
