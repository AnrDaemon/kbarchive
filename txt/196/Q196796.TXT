TITLE   :FIX: ClassWizard Unable to Create Files for New Class
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbwizard kbVC600bug kbClassWizard kbGrpDSTools kbNoUpdate

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click OK on the dialog box to create a new class in ClassWizard, the
following error message appears:

   Unable to open the files <class>.h, <class>.cpp

You are running Cheyenne's InocuLAN for Windows NT on Microsoft Windows NT 4.0.

CAUSE
=====

An interaction with the InocuLAN virus-scanning software causes ClassWizard to
report incorrectly that file creation failed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Two workarounds are suggested here:

 - Start the InocuLAN Realtime Monitor if it is not already started. On the
   Explorer taskbar, right-click the InocuLAN Realtime Monitor icon. Click
   Monitor Incoming Files.


 - Close the project workspace and delete the project's .clw file. Reopen the
   project, load ClassWizard, and rebuild the .clw database at the prompt.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++ .NET.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Virus-scanning software interactions may cause other problems with Visual C++.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

In these steps, it is assumed that you are running Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 with
Cheyenne InocuLAN for Windows NT. The InocuLAN Realtime Monitor is set to
monitor both incoming and outgoing files.

1. Start Visual C++ 6.0.

2. From the File menu, click New. On the Project tab, select MFC AppWizard
   (.exe). Name the project (TestWiz, for example). Click OK. Click Finish.
   Click OK at the confirmation dialog box.

3. From the Insert menu, click Resource. Select Dialog, then click New.

4. Double-click the new dialog box displayed in the resource editor.

5. ClassWizard appears with a prompt to create a new class for the dialog box ID
   of the new dialog box; click OK.

6. In the Name edit box, type in x; click OK.

A dialog box appears with the error message:

   Unable to open the files x.h, x.cpp
