SYMPTOMS
========

After installing Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 2 (SR-2), you may receive the
following error message when you click the Insert Address icon in Word:

   Logon failed. You must log on to Microsoft Exchange to access your address
   book. Error code: "Unspecified error".


RESOLUTION
==========

Reinstall Microsoft Outlook 98 and install Corporate or Workgroup mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On computer systems with Netscape Communicator, Outlook 98 Internet Mail Only
mode, Word 97, and Office 97 Service Release 2 (SR-2) installed, when you
attempt to insert an address in either the Envelope Wizard or Letter Wizard, an
error message appears, indicating that you must log on to Microsoft Exchange to
access your address book, and your address book is not opened.

This problem supposedly did not occur in Word with SR-1 installed and only
started occurring after the installation of SR-2. Re-installing Microsoft
Outlook 98 has resolved the problem.
