IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT Service Pack 4 includes a new feature in the System Policy Editor
that will allow the administrator to define the default selection for the prompt
displayed to the user in the event that the locally cached user profile is newer
than the central profile. This fix requires that the service pack be applied to
the client workstation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

These new system policies are located under Default Computer/Windows NT User
Profiles.

 - "Choose profile default operation" allows the administrator to specify which
   option in the dialog box will be the default -- use the local profile or
   overwrite it with the server-based copy.

 - "Time out for dialog boxes" allows the administrator to determine how long
   the dialog box waits for the user to decide.

Using these policies, the administrator can set Windows NT to use the local
profile by default, and set the dialog box time out to 0 seconds. With this
configuration, the client will automatically use the local profile if it is
newer than the central profile, and the user will not even be prompted.

As an alternative, these options can be set directly in the registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).
