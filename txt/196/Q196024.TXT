MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create and run a program with the following code:

   

         oTBar=CREATEOBJECT("mytoolbar")
         oTBar.Show
         READ EVENTS

         DEFINE CLASS mytoolbar AS toolbar

            Caption = "Toolbar1"
            Height = 109
            Left = 0
            Top = 0
            Width = 110
            Name = "mytoolbar"

            ADD OBJECT olecontrol1 AS olecontrol WITH ;
               OLECLASS="MSComCtl2.DTPicker.2",;
               Top = 5, ;
               Left = 5, ;
               Height = 100, ;
               Width = 100, ;
               Name = "Olecontrol1"

            ADD OBJECT cmdbtn1 AS COMMANDBUTTON
               procedure cmdbtn1.click
                  clear events
               endproc

         ENDDEFINE

2. When the ToolBar displays, click inside the Date Time Picker Control. You may
   want to either highlight a date value or click the DOWN ARROW key.

3. Using an ALT key combination like ALT+Z, ALT+C, or ALT+U and so on, causes
   the following exception error:

   Fatal Error: Exception code-C0000005 Called from ...........

   Clicking OK, the only option, shuts down Visual FoxPro.

NOTE: Any ALT key combination other than the Visual FoxPro System menu Hot Keys
(ALT+F, ALT+E, ALT+V, ALT+T, ALT+P, ALT+W, ALT+H) causes the exception error.
