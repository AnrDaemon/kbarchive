TITLE   :XADM: Remove Connectors Before Running Move Server Wizard
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

The Move Server Wizard does not move connectors and gateways for delivering
messages to foreign mail systems. All third-party gateways must be removed
before running the wizard. Also, you must remove all connectors installed on the
server, unless you are moving the last server in a site. When you are moving the
last server in a site, the directory replication connector and any mail
connector that supports the directory replication connector can still be
installed when you run the wizard.

After the move, you will need to reconfigure connectors. If prompted, reinstall
Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1 to your server. For more
information on how the wizard handles connectors, see the section "Connectors
and Replication" in the Move Server Wizard Help file (Mvexsrvr.hlp).

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: If you are moving a server from a multi-server site that has the Microsoft
Mail Connector installed, remove the connector before installing it on another
server in the original site. This will ensure that the Adminsch mailbox agent is
installed on a server that is not moving.

If you have directory synchronization configured with a foreign mail system, see
"Directory Synchronization Issues" in the Move Server Wizard Help file for tasks
that you must perform before the move.

For more information on connectors and gateways, see the chapter for each
connector or gateway in Microsoft Exchange Server Operations.
