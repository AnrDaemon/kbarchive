TITLE   :XADM: Move Server Dialog Box is Misleading
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you move a server with a distribution list (DL) named Object1 to a site
which contains a mailbox with the same name, Object1, an "Edit Duplicate" dialog
box is displayed, which offers you the opportunity to rename the DL that is
being moved.

The anomaly is that even though Object1 in the destination site is a mailbox, the
dialog box refers to it as a DL, which may cause you to make a decision based on
the assumption that the object in the destination site is a DL.

STATUS
======


Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Move Server component of
Exchange Server version 5.5.
