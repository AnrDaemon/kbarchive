-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Word always updates some fields automatically when a document is printed or
previewed, even if the Update Fields option is turned off.

The fields that update automatically are:

   AUTONUM
   AUTONUMLGL
   AUTONUMOUT
   BARCODE
   EQ

The fields that are updated when you print or preview your document are:

   DATE
   PAGE
   PAGEREF (This field does not update when in the header or footer)
   PRINTDATE (This field updates only when you print)
   REF to a bookmark or any cross-reference
   SECTIONPAGES
   STYLEREF (This field can be locked to prevent updating)
   SEQ


CAUSE
=====

Certain fields are "Display" fields, which means they do not perform a
calculation. These fields show a result even when you do not update them, and
appear whether or not you print the document. These "Display" fields include
AUTONUM, AUTONUMLGL, AUTONUMOUT, BARCODE, and EQ.

Certain other fields are related to pagination and printing and will only update
when you print or preview your document. These fields include DATE, PAGE,
PAGEREF, PRINTDATE, REF, and SECTIONPAGES.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are other fields you may use in your document that are not updated when
you print or preview your document unless the Update Fields option is selected
on the Print tab.

To ensure all fields are updated when you print or preview your document, follow
these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. Click the Print tab.

3. Click to select the Update Fields check box, and then click OK.
