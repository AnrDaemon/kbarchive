SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the intrinsic Visual Basic file system controls (for example,
DriveListBox, DirListBox, FileListBox), some or all of your files are not
listed. This usually occurs when you are trying to access files on a network
server, but can occur locally under some circumstances.

CAUSE
=====

The following statement is copied from the Visual Basic 5.0 Programmer's Guide
(page 67) and you can also find it in the File System Controls section of the
Forms, Controls, and Menus topic in Books Online:

   Note: These controls are provided primarily for backward compatibility with
   applications created in earlier versions of Visual Basic. The common dialog
   control provides an easier method of working with file access.

   For more information on common dialog control, see "Miscellaneous Controls"
   later in this chapter.

These controls are old technology. They were not designed for, nor tested with,
some of the new operating and network system software. Specifically, these
controls rely on the existence of 8.3 file and directory names. Any set of
circumstances that result in the unavailability of 8.3 names will cause
problems. For example, you can disable the creation of 8.3 file or directory
names on a Windows NT Server. If this happens, the intrinsic controls will only
see those directories or files that have 8.3 names.

RESOLUTION
==========

As stated in the Visual Basic 5.0 Programmer's Guide, the best resolution is to
use the CommonDialog control. Not only is it more likely to work, it also makes
your application's user interface consistent with other Windows applications.

Even if you do not want to use the CommonDialog, it can help you determine the
specific nature of the problem you are experiencing. To demonstrate this, try
using the CommonDialog to access the directories or files that are causing the
problem when you are using the intrinsic controls. If the CommonDialog can
display these files, the problem is most likely the result of the limitations of
the intrinsic controls. If the CommonDialog fails, the problem is most likely
located in the computer or network file system configuration.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
