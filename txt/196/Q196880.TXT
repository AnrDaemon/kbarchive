SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Word provides an Agenda Wizard for the creation of an Agenda and
Minutes form. The wizard does not prompt you to modify character formatting such
as font, point size, and so forth. This article describes how you can use the
Agenda Wizard to create your own custom wizard.

NOTE: Microsoft does not support the modification of its wizards or templates.
Modifications done by the user are at the user's risk and constitute no
obligations or warranties, either written or expressed, by Microsoft.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: The Agenda Wizard is not installed by the Word 97 for Windows Setup
program. If you installed Word 97 from a compact disc, the Agenda Wizard and
other wizards are located in the ValuPack\Template\Word folder. To use the
Wizard, copy it to the Templates folder.

The default locations for the Templates folder is C:\Program Files\Microsoft
Office\Templates

To use the Agenda Wizard to create your own custom wizard, follow these steps:

1. On the File menu, click Open. Choose the folder where your templates are
   stored (the default location is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Templates).

2. In the Files Of Type list, select All Files (*.*).

3. In the Look In list, select the Agenda Wizard, and then click Open.

4. On the File menu, click Save As, and type a new name for the wizard.

   Any formatting changes you make will now be stored in your new wizard.

5. On the Insert menu, point to AutoText, and click AutoText. Highlight the
   AutoText entry that corresponds to the Agenda or Minutes style you want to
   use. Click the Insert button.

       Modern           Informal                  Minutes1
       Standard         Standard                  Minutes2

6. Click the Show/Hide button so that it is enabled, display table gridlines (on
   the Table menu, click Gridlines), and turn on Bookmarks.

   NOTE: Do not delete any of the bookmarks. If these are deleted, the wizard may
   not function properly.

7. Select the text or table cell in which you want to make changes (be sure the
   end-of-cell marker or paragraph mark is also selected). Make your formatting
   changes, such as changing the font or point size, adding bold or italics, and
   so forth. When you are finished, deselect the area by clicking in the margin
   of the document.

8. On the Insert menu, point to AutoText, and then click AutoText. Select the
   AutoText entry that you previously selected in step 2. Make a note of the
   exact name (you will need to type it again in step 7). Click the Delete
   button to delete the old AutoText entry. Click the Close button to return to
   the document.

9. On the Edit menu, click Select All to highlight your document.

10. On the Insert menu, point to AutoText, and then click AutoText. In the
   AutoText dialog box, type the AutoText name using the same name as the
   deleted AutoText entry from step 5. From the Look In list, select your
   template. Click the Add button to return to the document.

11. With the document still selected, click Cut on the Edit menu. You should now
   have a blank page with a single paragraph mark at the top left of the page.
   If you have any text or more than a single paragraph mark, delete these
   items. On the File menu, click Save and then close the template.

You can now use the Agenda Wizard with the new styles by clicking New on the File
menu, and then choosing Agenda Wizard from the Template list and clicking OK.
