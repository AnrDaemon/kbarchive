-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you search for a font in a document using the Find or Replace command, the
font is not listed in the Font list box of the Find Font dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur if the font is embedded in the Word document. In the Find
Font dialog box, Word lists only those fonts that are installed in the operating
system--fonts embedded in a Word document are not available as formatting
options in the Find and Replace commands.

Text formatted with an embedded font is listed in the font list on the Formatting
toolbar. This information is preserved to facilitate round-trip transfer between
different computers and platforms.

RESOLUTION
==========

To search for a font that is embedded in a document but not installed in the
operating system, type the font name into the Font list box in the Find Font
dialog box. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the Edit menu, click Find.

2. Click the More button, click the Format button, and then click Font.

3. Click the Font tab.

4. Type the font name in the Font box, and then click OK.
