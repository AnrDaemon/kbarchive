KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When SNA Server is configured for "per server" licensing mode, SNA Server may
incorrectly detect that it has reached its client license limit, and log the
following event:

   Event ID: 597
   Source: SNA Server
   Description: User limit of <license limit> exceeded: client connection
   rejected

When this occurs, the client application may receive one of the following error
messages:

   A 3270 emulator will be unable to open a session through the SNA Server.

   An APPC or CPIC application will receive a TP_STARTED, [MC_]ALLOCATE or CMALLC
   failure when attempting to allocate a conversation.

This problem does not occur when SNA Server is configured for "per seat"
licensing mode.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server was failing to clear the client count when the SNA Server service is
stopped and restarted.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 4.0 and 4.0
Service Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
