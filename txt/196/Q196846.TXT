TITLE   :XFOR: Migration Wizard Fails when Migrating from GroupWise 4.1a
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During the migration of a Novell GroupWise 4.1a client, the Migration Wizard
fails while copying the users' mail. No errors or warnings are logged in the
event viewer. The timer on the Migration Wizard keeps counting. Migration can be
canceled but not resumed.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT Server computer performing the migration must have the Novell
GroupWise client installed, and the Novell GroupWise client must be available in
the path. The GroupWise client uses a viewer to display the contents of an
e-mail attachment without retrieving it into an application.

The viewer can display text, graphics, codes, and faxes. The viewer requires a
"patch" or an update to the viewer file in order to view some attachments. For
example, to view Office 97 documents, the latest patch for the GroupWise client
must be installed.

Because the Migration Wizard uses the GroupWise client to migrate user messages
and attachments, the Migration Wizard may fail when it attempts to copy an
attachment which the GroupWise client cannot view.

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid this problem, apply the latest GroupWise client viewer patch on the
Windows NT Server computer that is running the migration. The patch may be found
at http://support.novell.com.
