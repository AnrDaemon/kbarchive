TITLE   :WD97: No Table Headings Following Next Page Section Break

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Word does not repeat a table heading after a manual page break or any
type of section break.

CAUSE
=====

This functionality is by design of Microsoft Word. When you insert a "hard" page
break or any kind of section break within a table, Word splits that table into
two individual tables. In order for Headings in a table to work, the table must
be one continuous table.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Word automatically repeats table headings only for tables that are split by
"soft" page breaks.

To set Headings within a table, follow these steps:

1. Click in the first row of the table or select the rows that you want to see
   on the top of the table on all pages.

   NOTE: The first row of the table must be in the selection.

2. On the Table menu, click Headings. A check mark appears beside Headings when
   your insertion point is in the row(s) designated as Headings.
