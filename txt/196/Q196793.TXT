SUMMARY
=======

This article quickly explains how to restrict Internet mail to specific Internet
e-mail domains. It is geared towards Exchange Server organizations that do not
permit users to send and receive Internet mail, but must communicate over the
Internet Mail Service to other Exchange Server organizations or sites.

To restrict sending Internet mail to specific domain, perform the following
steps:

1. In the Exchange Server Administrator program connections, double-click on the
   Internet Mail Service to open the property pages.

2. Select the Address Space tab, which specifies which domains the Internet Mail
   Service is allowed to send mail to.

3. If the Internet Mail Service is currently configured to send to all Internet
   mail domains, you will see "SMTP * 1" in the Address Space. Select the entry,
   click Edit, and the SMTP properties will appear.

4. In the E-Mail Domain field, edit the entry to specify a specific domain. For
   example, specifying "*@microsoft.com," allows the users to send Internet mail
   only to the microsoft.com domain.

5. Click OK to add the allowed domain.

6. To allow the users to send e-mail to more than one domain, click New, specify
   the Type (SMTP in all cases regarding the Internet Mail Service), and type
   the address of the second allowed domain.
