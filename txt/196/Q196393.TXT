TITLE   :XADM: Move Server Wizard Error "Server Contains Public Folders"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Exchange Server 5.5 Move Server Wizard, the following error may
occur:

   WARNING: The server '<server name>' contains public folders. These
   public folders and their contents will be removed from this server as
   part of the move process.

   To ensure these folders remain available in the '<site name>' site
   after
   this server moves, verify that they are homed on a different server in
   the '<site name>' site before continuing.

CAUSE
=====

If there are any Public Folders homed on the server being moved this error will
occur.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, verify that there is a replica of each Public
Folder on another server in the site and that the data has been replicated. Or
verify that the data has been backed up to a PST or News Group server. See
Public Folder in the Help file in the Move Server Wizard for more information on
saving Public Folder information.
