TITLE   :Files Are Replicated Even When No Sync Appears in Status
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Windows NT 3.51 computer operates as an export server and a Windows NT
4.0 computer operates as an import server to participate in directory
replication, the Status column on the import server's Directory Replication
dialog box may display NO SYNC. This status appears under the heading "Import
Directories" on the import server. Users have reported that even though the NO
SYNC status is shown, files appear to be replicated correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem is resolved by assuring that the export files contained on the
Windows NT 3.51 export server are stabilized prior to replication time.

This may be accomplished by performing the following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double- click
   Server.

2. Click Replication.

3. Under Export Directories, click to select Wait Until Stabilized. By default,
   the Stabilize check box is not selected under Windows NT 3.51 and Windows NT
   4.0.
