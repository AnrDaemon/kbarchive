TITLE   :XWEB: Day or Year Inconsistencies in OWA Calendar View
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you open a calendar by using Outlook Web Access (OWA), one day may be
displayed in the middle pane of the calendar, but a different day may be
displayed in the two-month calendar view in the right pane.

CAUSE
=====

The day and date that are displayed in the middle pane are generated from the
settings on the server running Internet Information Service (IIS) and OWA. The
two-month calendar view in the right pane is generated by a Java applet that
uses your workstation date settings. This can cause inconsistencies if the year
is set incorrectly on either the server or the client, or if the client is on a
different side of the International Date Line than the server running IIS and
OWA.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the year is incorrect on either the client or the server, correct the year
setting on the problem computer.

If the client and server are on different sides of the International Date Line,
place a server running IIS and OWA in the same time zone that the client
computers are in.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Outlook Web Access clients pull their date and time zone information from the
server running IIS and OWA. In other words, the date and time zone context that
you are in when you log on to Outlook Web Access is defined by the location of
the server running IIS and OWA. This is what can cause a message to appear to
arrive earlier or later than it was actually sent. An exception to this rule is
the two-month calendar view that is displayed in the right pane of a personal
calendar. This pane is generated by a Java applet and pulls the local day and
year information from the computer that the browser is running on.
