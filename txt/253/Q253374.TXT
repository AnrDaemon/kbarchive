SUMMARY
=======

When trying to access the Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Resource Kit documentation
in the January 2000 MSDN Library, an error similar to the following will occur:

   Internet Explorer cannot open the Internet site
   mk:@MSITStore:E:\MSDN\MSDN\nt40res.chm::/S581A.HTM.

   %1 could not be found.

The Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Resource Kit documentation is not included in the
January 2000 MSDN Library. The Nt40res.chm file included with the January 2000
MSDN Library was incorrect.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior

1. Start the MSDN Library January 2000.

2. On the Contents tab, navigate to the following node:

   Windows Resource Kits; Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Resource Kit

3. Attempt to open any topic in that node. Note the error message that appears.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in MSDN Library version January 2000 for
Windows 98, Windows NT, and Windows 2000.

If you have the October 1999 MSDN Library available, the stand-alone
documentation for the NT Workstation 4.0 Resource Kit can be obtained from it:

1. Insert the MSDN Library October 1999 Disc 1.

2. Navigate to the MSDN directory and copy Nt40res.chi from the CD-ROM onto your
   hard drive.

3. Insert Disc 2.

4. Navigate to the MSDN directory and copy Nt40res.chm from the CD into the same
   folder as the CHI file.

5. Double-click the CHM file to view the Resource Kit documentation.

   (Note that you still cannot view the Resource Kit within the MSDN Library
   itself.)
