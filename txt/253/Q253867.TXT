PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes does not retain hyperlink
information in messages sent from Exchange Server to Lotus Notes. If a message
contains hyperlinks or URLs, the Notes user receives the message as text only,
and the link is not active.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes uses a Notes
dynamic-link library (DLL) to perform Rich Text Format (RTF) to Notes Compound
Data conversion, and this DLL cannot process hyperlinks.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
