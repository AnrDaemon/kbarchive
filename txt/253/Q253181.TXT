TITLE   :Multivalued Attributes Pushed Incorrectly to Other LDAP Servers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services 2.1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT, on platform(s):
       - the hardware: Intel x86 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you push multivalued attributes with any of the Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol (LDAP) management agents (MAs) to a connected directory, only
the last value is written. For example, consider pushing the
FacsimileTelephoneNumber multivalued attribute to an object with the following
values:

   FacsimileTelephoneNumber:999-1211
   FacsimileTelephoneNumber:999-1212
   FacsimileTelephoneNumber:999-1213

This results in the following incorrect assignment:

   FacsimileTelephoneNumber
   999-1213

The correct result should be:

   FacsimileTelephoneNumber
   999-1211
   999-1212
   999-1213

CAUSE
=====

Cdir_ln.exe does not handle multivalued attributes properly when an ADD is sent.
It works correctly when you update with a MOD.
