TITLE   :XADM: ADC Does Not Match to SID History After a User Is Cloned
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbWin2000PreSP1Fix kbWin2000sp1Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you clone the user object associated with a Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5
mailbox into a domain, the user object is not upgraded. A duplicate object is
created in Active Directory instead of matching the user object to the
associated Microsoft Windows NT account.

This may happen when you set up a mirrored domain with Microsoft Windows 2000 and
then clone a user to copy the old Windows NT 4.0 accounts into your new Windows
2000 forest.

CAUSE
=====

In Exchange Server 5.5, mailboxes are linked to their Windows NT accounts by
means of the Security Identifier (SID). When reading the sidHistory from a
global catalogue, the ADC doesn't convert it to hexadecimal format so that it
can be compared with the associated Windows NT account.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q260910 How to Obtain the Latest Windows 2000 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows 2000 Service Pack 1.Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5.
