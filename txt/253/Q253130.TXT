 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0, 6.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to display a message box in the ExitInstance function of a
dialog-based Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) application, you don't see the
message box displayed. Also, if you place any window creation code after the
DoModal call in your InitInstance function, you don't see the window.

CAUSE
=====

Destruction of the main window causes a WM_QUIT message to be posted to the main
application thread indicating to the operating system that the thread is to be
terminated. Any window created after this is destroyed immediately after
creation resulting in a brief flash.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, comment out the line in the InitInstance function
that assigns the m_pMainWnd function to your dialog as follows:

     // m_pMainWnd = &dlg;

Also, and instead of using message boxes, you could use the MFC TRACE macros to
display information in the debug output window for debugging purposes.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new MFC dialog-based application called "Dlgbased".

2. Add the following code to the InitInstance function:

   BOOL CDlgbasedApp::InitInstance()
   {
      int ret;
      ret = AfxMessageBox("Before Dialog");

      CDlgbasedDlg dlg;
      m_pMainWnd = &dlg;

      int nResponse = dlg.DoModal();
      if (nResponse == IDOK)
      {
      }
      else if (nResponse == IDCANCEL)
      {
      }

      ret = AfxMessageBox("After Dialog.  Won't see me");
      return FALSE;
   }

3. Use ClassWizard to override the ExitInstance function for CdlgbasedApp.

4. Add the following code to the ExitInstance function:

   BOOL CDlgbasedApp::ExitInstance()
   {
      AfxMessageBox("Won't see me!");
      return CWinApp::ExitInstance();
   }

5. Build and run the application.

After dismissing the dialog box, notice that the message boxes do not appear.
