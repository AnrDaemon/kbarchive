PRODUCT :Microsoft Press
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

SMCLIENT may hang at the Winlogon dialog waiting for user input. It may be
necessary to restart the tool. However, SMCLIENT still may not execute the logon
command.

CAUSE
=====

SMCLIENT will run and connect to the Terminal Server and the Winlogon dialog
will appear. However, SMCLIENT does not send the users name to the Winlogon
dialog, thus Terminal Server Client does not logon to the Terminal Server.

==========

Microsoft has created a replacement for SMCLIENT.EXE that fixes this problem.

documentation for SMCLIENT.

SMCLIENT is available for download from the following Microsoft FTP site:
