SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start the Shared Folders Gateway service after installing SNA
Server 4.0 Service Pack 3, the service may move from a pending state to an
inactive state, and the following event is logged in the Application event log:

   Event ID: 5009

   The Shared Folders Gateway was unable to unload the Shared Folders
   File System Driver (SFFSD.SYS).

CAUSE
=====

If the Shared Folders Gateway service was running when you installed the service
pack, all the files associated with the service may not have been updated
correctly, which causes a file version mismatch.

1. From Control Panel Services, stop all SNA Server services.

2. Re-apply Service Pack 3.
