TITLE   :MA Updates Not Written to the Transaction Stack
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view the transaction stack by using the VIATranRpt tool, transactions
entries may be missing for a specific Management Agent (MA). By default, every
time an MA adds, modifies, or deletes a record, it is recorded in the
transaction stack. You can display this information in text format by dumping
the transaction stack.

CAUSE
=====

Although this behavior (recording transactions) is the default behavior, you can
disable this functionality. If this functionality is disabled when the MA is
run, the information is not written to the transaction stack and appears to be
missing.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, enable this functionality on the problem MA:

1. Log on to compass with an Administrator account.

2. In the Action panel, click Bookmarks, and then click Management Agents.

3. Click the problem MA.

4. In the Action panel, click Configure MA.

5. Click the Metadirectory Relationships tab.

6. On the Configuration tab, click to select the "Write entries to the
   transactions stack during synchronization" check box.

7. Click OK.
