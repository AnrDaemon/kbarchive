SUMMARY

This article describes the availability of Universal Serial Bus (USB) support in
Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

USB support for Windows 95 is available in Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)
versions of Windows 95. If you purchased Windows 95 boxed product (the full or
upgrade version) from a retail store, you have a retail version of Windows 95.
Retail versions of Windows 95 cannot be upgraded to OEM versions, and there is
no separate download to enable USB support in any version of Windows 95. If you
have an OEM version of Windows 95 and you want to enable USB support, contact
your OEM.

To determine the version of Windows 95 you are running:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   System.

2. Click the General tab.

3. Locate the version number under the System heading, and then see the
   following table.

*If you have a version of Windows 95 that does not have USB support, and you want
USB support, Microsoft recommends that you upgrade to Windows 98 Second
Edition.


4. If you are running an OEM version of Windows 95, the Product ID number under
   the Registered To heading typically contains 20 digits. If digits 6, 7, and 8
   contain the letters "OEM," your version of Windows 95 is an OEM version. For
   example, the following sample Product ID number indicates an OEM
   installation:

   12345-OEM-6789098-76543

Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Version Identification
------------------------------------------------------------

Windows 95 may have been preinstalled on your computer. These installations are
referred to as OEM installations. An OEM Service Release (for example, OSR2) is
an updated version of a product for PC manufacturers (OEMs) to preinstall on new
PCs. The purpose is to allow OEMs to install an integrated Windows 95 product
that contains the latest available individual updates and supports recent
advances in hardware that require core operating system support.

Additional OEM Information
--------------------------

 - In Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2), 2.1 (OSR2.1) and 2.5 (OSR2.5),
   not all files have the version stamp that is listed in the table. In OSR2.1
   and OSR2.5, only files that were updated to provide support for the Win32
   Driver Model (WDM) and USB may have this version stamp (the other files have
   the same version stamps as the corresponding OSR2 files).

   You can view file version information by right-clicking a file in Windows
   Explorer, clicking Properties on the menu that appears, and then clicking the
   Version tab. If there is no Version tab, there is no version information
   available for that file.

 - Updates to Windows 95 OEM OSR2 generally have a version of 4.00.1112 or
   later.

 - To determine whether you are running OSR2.1, check for "USB Supplement to
   OSR2" in the list of installed programs in the Add/Remove Programs tool in
   Control Panel, and check for version 4.03.1212 of the Ntkern.vxd file in the
   Windows\System\Vmm32 folder.

 - If you are running OSR2.5 and you uninstall the USB Supplement by using the
   Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel, the version number changes to
   4.00.950b on the General tab in System properties.

NOTE: All versions of Microsoft Windows 98 include USB support.
