KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Novell GroupWise to delegate an appointment that contains comments to
an Exchange Server user, you may not be able to send the appointment.

CAUSE
=====

When you send an appointment that contains comments, an attached file named
Comments is created. This issue can occur if the Microsoft Exchange Connector
for Novell GroupWise does not process the attached Comments file because there
is already a Comments file in the Gw2mexa folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
