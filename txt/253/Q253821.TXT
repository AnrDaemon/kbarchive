   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When a non-administrative user attempts to reconnect to a shared network drive
that the user has already used, system error 85 ("Local device name already in
use") may be generated.

For example, running the following sequence of commands in a logon script or from
a command prompt illustrates the issue:

   net use r: /d
   net use r: \\<servername>\<share>
   net use r: /d
   net use r: \\<servername>\<share>

The behavior does not occur for users with administrative privileges.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by a setting of 1 in the following registry value:

   HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SessionManager\ProtectionMode

If the setting is 1, the problem occurs. If you change the setting to 0 and
reboot the server, the problem disappears.

Note that the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base suggest changing
this value to 1 to restrict changes to Base System objects and for solving
problems with symbolic links:

   Q218473 Restricting Changes to Base System Objects

   Q244995 Base System Object Restrictions Are Not Enabled by Default

   Q222159 Symbolic Link Case Sensitivity Exploit Bypasses System Security

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Change the entry for

   HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SessionManager\ProtectionMode

from 1 to 0.
