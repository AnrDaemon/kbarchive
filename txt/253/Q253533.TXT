TITLE   :Using the Person Entry Count to Determine the Number of Users

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you view the properties of the DSA (Server) object in the directory or the
Known Universe, there is a value called Person Entry Count. This is not the
current count of users in the directory. It is the number of users in the
directory since the count was last performed. Running a Management Agent or
Replication Agreement does not update this value.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Person Entry Count value is updated in the following two ways:

 - When Microsoft Metadirectory Services (MMS) is started or restarted, it
   performs an initial Person Entry Count and updates this value. It also
   records the entry in the Zoomserv\Data\Logs\Genlog file.

 - After the initial count is made, it is recounted periodically (approximately
   every 12 hours) by a low-priority thread.

Additional query words: VIA users in the directory
