SUMMARY
=======

When you use Outlook's Advanced Find option (located on the Tools menu), and you
select Files (Outlook/Exchange) in the Look for box, Outlook does not search for
file attachments in messages. When you select Files (Outlook/Exchange) in the
Look for box, the entry in the In box defaults to Inbox, with a Browse button to
add, remove, or change folders. This feature is designed to search for files in
the form of "FreeDocs" stored in Outlook folders.

MORE INFORMATION
================

"FreeDocs" are file types such as .doc, .xls, or .txt that are located in an
Outlook folder for storage. They are not attached to an Outlook form such as a
message or a post. Additionally, the icon to identify a FreeDoc is the same as
its native application. Normally, FreeDocs are stored in a public folder but you
can also store them in private folders such as the Inbox by right-clicking the
file, dragging it from the file system to Outlook's Inbox, and then clicking
Copy on the shortcut menu.
