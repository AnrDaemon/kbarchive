TITLE   :BUG: Printing to a Non-Default Printer May Cause an Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting kbReportWriter kbvfp600bug kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbCodeSnippet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a print request is sent to a non-default printer with the Microsoft Visual
FoxPro REPORT FORM ... PROMPT command, Visual FoxPro may cause an error,
generate a GPF, quit or print to the wrong printer. The text of the error
message is:

   Error loading printer driver

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem you must programmatically change the FoxPro printer.

You can use code to get the name of the printer before you print, set the printer
to that name and then issue the REPORT FORM command.

The following Microsoft Knowledge Base article explains how you can specify that
a Visual FoxPro report be sent to a particular printer:

   Q162798 HOWTO: Use SET PRINTER TO NAME to Specify Report Destination

In most instances, this method is acceptable. However, there may be some
instances that require more control over the report options, such as number of
copies, paper source, paper size, and page ranges.

If you require more control over the print report options, you may want to use
the ReportFormPrompt.exe sample.

beginning of this article.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

This problem may be reproducible with several different types of printers that
are installed on a computer.

1. Install the following printers to the computer:

    HP4000 PCL
    Kyocera FS-3500
    Generic Text (Set this printer as default)

NOTE: The actual printer does not have to exist. You can use the Printers control
panel applet to pause printing to these printers in order to suppress "printer
not ready" error messages. The following combination produces the most
consistent results of failure.

2. Create a report named MyReport.

3. Enter the following code into the Visual FoxPro Command window, and then
   press ENTER:

   REPORT FORM MyReport TO PRINTER PROMPT

4. Print to the printers in the following order:

	HP4000 PCL		OK
	Kyocera FS-3500		Error loading PD
	*Generic Text		OK
	HP4000 PCL		Error loading PD
	Kyocera FS-3500		Error loading PD

NOTE: * Denotes the default printer
