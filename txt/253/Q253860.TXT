SUMMARY
=======

For attributes to flow from a connected directory into the Metaverse, the
attributes must be defined and configured with certain attribute flow rules.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Notes Management Agent (MA) is already configured to cause the Lotus Notes
SMTP mail address attribute to flow. The Notes Person record contains a field
called ShortName, which holds the part of the SMTP address needed to send Notes
mail. This is the short name for the full SMTP address (consisting of the name
before the @ character). Because in most environments the full SMTP name is
required, the ShortName field may have to be put in the proper format.

You can use the following assignment in the process of assigning the ShortName
attribute to the Mail attribute in the Metadirectory:

1. Click the Lotus Notes MA.

2. In the Action panel, click Attribute Flow.

3. Click the Advanced Flow Script tab.

4. Type the following flow rule

   $md.mail = ($cd.zcNotesShortName)@<domain>.com

where <domain> is the appropriate domain name.

5. Click OK.
