SYMPTOMS
========

RDPCLIP's capabilities to transfer files and folders between the client and
server sessions may not work if the Terminal Server session was disconnected and
reconnected.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has created a new version of the installation file, FXFRINST.BAT, that
will make the appropriate adjustments to the registry keys and resolve this
problem.

The updated version of RDPCLIP.EXE contains the updated FXFRINST.BAT and FXFR.INI
files.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

   Rdpclip.exe
   (http://download.microsoft.com/download/win2000platform/rdpclip/1.0/NT5/EN-US/rdpclip_hotfix.exe)
