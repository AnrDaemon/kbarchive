-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You are unable to successfully install the Systems Management Server (SMS)
client on a Windows NT 4.0-based computer by using the Smsls.bat file, but you
do not receive any error messages.

You may see entries similar to the following one in the WN_Logon.log file:

   Wrote "SMSClientPath=C:\WINDOWS\" into file "C:\TEMP\SMSBOOT1.INI", iRet = 1
   $$<SMSBOOT1.EXE>
   Calling _spawnl("C:\WINDOWS\MS\SMS\CORE\BIN\Boot32wn.exe",
   "C:\WINDOWS\MS\SMS\CORE\BIN\Boot32wn.exe", "-NT", "-OC:\TEMP\SMSBOOT1.INI",
   NULL, NULL) $$<SMSBOOT1.EXE>

If you attempt to run Snboot.exe, or Smsboot1.exe on the client, you may receive
the following error message:

   This program cannot be run in dos mode.

CAUSE
=====

The dosonly command is enabled in the Config.nt file.

WORKAROUND
==========

Disable the dosonly option by remarking (REM) it out of the Config.nt file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT Help DOSONLY notes:

   Normally when you exit an MS-DOS-based application, Windows NT returns to the
   Windows NT command interpreter (CMD.EXE). However, by default, when you run a
   TSR or temporarily suspend an MS-DOS-based application to return to the
   command prompt Windows NT runs COMMAND.COM, the command interpreter for the
   MS-DOS environment. This preserves the MS-DOS environment allowing you to use
   the TSR immediately.

   Because starting and running other types of applications from the COMMAND.COM
   prompt can disrupt a TSR or suspended MS-DOS-based applications, Windows NT
   provides the DOSONLY command. The DOSONLY command allows only MS-DOS-based
   applications to be started from the COMMAND.COM prompt. You can include the
   DOSONLY command in your CONFIG.NT file or the equivalent custom startup file
   in an application?s PIF.
