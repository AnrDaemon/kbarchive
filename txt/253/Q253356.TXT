TITLE   :PRB: "API Call Caused an Exception" with 3rd-Party Print Drivers

KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbprint kbPrinting kbvfp600 kbOSWin95 kbOSWin98 kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using a Hewlett Packard LaserJet 4000 PCL5e or other third-party print
driver, a non-fatal error can occur:

   API call caused an exception

CAUSE
=====

The third-party print drivers are not resetting the floating point coprocessor.

RESOLUTION
==========

Here is a workaround to the behavior. The error message "API call caused an
exception" is trappable and reports an error number of 2028. The error can be
handled by placing an _fpreset() function call and a retry command in an
error-handling procedure. The following code demonstrates the basic structure
for trapping this error:

   DECLARE _fpreset IN MSVCRT20.DLL
   ON ERROR DO errHand WITH ERROR()
   SET LIBRARY TO HOME()+"foxtools.fll"
   SET PRINTER TO GETPRINTER()
   ? _wfindtitl("Command") && Error occurs at this point

   PROCEDURE errHand
   PARAMETERS _lcError
      DO CASE
          CASE _lcError = 2028 && API call caused an exception
   	       _fpreset()
   	       RETRY
          OTHERWISE
                  ERROR _lcError
          ENDCASE
   ENDPROC

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Behavior
-------------------------------

1. Install a HP LaserJet 4000 PCL5e print driver.

2. Copy the following code into a FoxPro program:

   SET LIBRARY TO HOME()+"FOXTOOLS.FLL"
   SET PRINTER TO GETPRINTER()
   ? _wfindtitl("command")

3. Execute the new program.

4. Choose the HP LaserJet 4000 PCL5e print driver.

The error message listed in the "Symptoms" section is displayed.
