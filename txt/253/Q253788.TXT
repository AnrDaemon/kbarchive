KEYWORDS:kbgraphic

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open a .jpg file or any other image file, the image may be
opened in a separate instance of the program that is associated with the image
file type. For example, if Iexplore.exe is associated with .jpg files and you
open multiple .jpg files in Windows Explorer, each .jpg file is opened in a new
instance of Microsoft Internet Explorer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) parameters are not specified
in the file association properties for the image file type.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. In Windows Explorer, on the View menu, click Folder Options.

2. On the File Types tab, click the file type you want to edit (for example,
   JPEG), and then click Edit.

3. In the Actions area, click Open, and then click Edit.

4. Click to select the Use DDE check box.

5. Fill in the DDE commands that are required for the program that is associated
   with the file type being edited.

   For example, to use Internet Explorer to open each .jpg file in the same
   instance, type the following DDE commands:

   DDE Message:"file://%1",,-1,,,,,

   Application: "C:\PROGRA~1\INTERN~1\iexplore.exe" -nohome

   DDE Application Not Running: leave blank
