TITLE   :Java Log Is Not Created on Terminal Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Internet Explorer has an advanced option to create a log file for
logging Java errors that are encountered by Internet Explorer when the browser
visits a Java-enabled Web site. This creates a log that is stored in the
%SystemRoot%\Java folder. However, when you are using Internet Explorer on
Terminal Server and you enable this option, the log file is not created.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you enable this advanced option in Internet Explorer while you are using
Terminal Server, the creation of the Java folder is mapped to the user's space,
or to the %SytemRoot%\Profiles\<Username>\Windows folder instead of the
%SystemRoot% folder. To resolve this issue, simply create the Java folder in the
%SytemRoot%\Profiles\<Username>\Windows folder.
