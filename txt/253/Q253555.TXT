PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbDataBinding kbReportWriter kbVBp600bug kbGrpDSVBDB kbDSupport kbVS600sp4fi

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to export a report from the Microsoft DataReport designer, you
receive the following error message:

   Report width is larger than the paper width.

This error usually occurs when the report you are trying to export is laid out
for Landscape orientation printing.

CAUSE
=====

The DataReport designer expects a page size of 8.5 x 11 inches laid out in a
Portrait orientation. Exporting the report to a text file or an HTML file in
Landscape orientation does not work properly because of this limitation.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is currently no workaround for this problem in releases prior to Visual
Studio 6.0 Service Pack 4.

This behavior no longer occurs with the version of the DataReport that ships with
the latest service pack for Visual Studio 6.0.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the latest service pack for
Visual Studio 6.0.
