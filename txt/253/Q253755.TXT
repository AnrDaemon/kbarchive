======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Exchange Server Migration Wizard for Lotus Notes may not migrate items that
exist only in the All Documents mail folder.

The All Documents view is a complete catalog of all of the documents (messages)
in the Notes mail database, which can contain items that are not in any visible
folder.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, move the documents to a folder, such as the Inbox
folder, the Drafts folder, the Sent Items folder, and so on.

MORE INFORMATION
================
