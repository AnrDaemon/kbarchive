TITLE   :XADM: MAPI Read Receipt Functionality over Internet Mail Service
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When Microsoft Outlook MAPI clients request a read receipt for a message going
to another Outlook MAPI client, a read receipt may not be generated if the
message travels over an Exchange Server Internet Mail Service.

In order to receive read receipts between Outlook MAPI clients over the Internet
Mail Service, it is necessary to properly configure the Internet Mail Service
properties.

It is important to note that this functionality is different between Outlook and
Microsoft Outlook Express. There is limited interoperability when requesting
read receipts between these clients. Typically, Outlook Express recognizes a
read receipt request from Outlook, but Outlook does not recognize a read receipt
from Outlook Express.

Outlook Express uses a different message property for read receipts and simply
ignores the property used by the Outlook MAPI client. Outlook Express uses this
property for read receipt requests:

Disposition-Notification-To:

Outlook uses this property for read receipt requests:

Return-Receipt-To:

MORE INFORMATION
================

In order for read receipt functionality to work properly between MAPI clients
communicating via the Microsoft Internet Mail Service, the settings below have
to be in place on the Outgoing Internet Mail Service properties page. Otherwise,
the read receipt request will be stripped during the message conversion
process.

1. Click the Internet Mail tab, and then click "Message Content(Attachments
   Outbound)". Select either MIME or UUENCODE.

2. On the Internet Mail tab, click Advanced Options, and then click Send
   Microsoft Exchange Rich Text Formatting. (This is the setting that controls
   the read receipt functionality). Select Always.

3. On the Internet Mail tab, click "Disable Automatic Replies to the Internet".
   Select Optional.

   This setting does not limit read receipt generation.
