TITLE   :Windows NT Desktop Turns Gray and Icons Disappear
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdisplay kbnetwork kbui kbshell

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows NT Workstation desktop may turn gray and the icons may disappear. When
this occurs, the desktop turns gray and is blank, with no icons or background.
The taskbar is still present. If you log off and back on, the desktop returns.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Windows NT user profiles are configured so that
the desktop is redirected to a network location. Any interruption of network
connectivity between the redirected desktop server and the workstation when
Explorer.exe tries to refresh the desktop causes the issue. Once this behavior
occurs, it typically cannot be refreshed. Logging off and back on restores the
desktop.

There are many causes for this behavior, including network connection problems,
(redirected desktop) server hangs, client workstation hangs, and so on. Some
users may receive error messages when the desktop goes gray, others may not.

RESOLUTION
==========

Because there are many causes for this behavior, there is no single fix. Some
occurrences of this issue clear up on their own, while other instances require a
logoff and logon. Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 may allow the desktop to recover
dynamically more readily than Internet Explorer 4.x. There is no specific fix
for disappearing desktops because this behavior is a symptom of an underlying
problem. Resolving the underlying issue causes the issue to stop occurring.
