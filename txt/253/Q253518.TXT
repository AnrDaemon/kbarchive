TITLE   :Time Stamp on Files on Windows NT 3.51 Server Is Changed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain circumstances, files that are accessed on a Windows NT 3.51-based
server from a Microsoft Windows 2000-based client may have their file date
changed to the year 1619, 1601, or another value.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is caused by OLE, which sets the file's time stamp to 0xffffffff
(-1) for all file time properties. This special -1 file time is supported by
Windows 2000 and Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, but not by Windows NT 3.51.

RESOLUTION
==========

A post-Service Pack 5 (SP5) hotfix is available for Windows NT 3.51.

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem.

fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and

update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
