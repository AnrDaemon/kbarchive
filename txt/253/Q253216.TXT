PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you use a backup program on a multiprocessor computer that uses a buffer
setting of more than 64 kilobytes (KB), the backup program does not detect a
corrupted page during the online backup. The database is backed up successfully,
even though it is corrupted.

The online backup program successfully detects the corrupted page on a single
processor computer, regardless of the buffer setting.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
