The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Microsoft Exchange MAPI management agent (MA) and
attempting to process custom recipients, you may receive the following error
message:

   Error was encountered in function : HrDoImport calling DAPIWrite.. Error
   message : DAPIWrite for Mailbox /o=MICROSOFT/ou=MMSREPRO/cn=Custom
   Recipients/cn=a0150094 failed with DAPI error 0xc0000120

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs because the zcDseUpdateHeader and zcDseUpdateAdd
settings have incorrect entries. The zcDseUpdateAdd setting has a first letter
of "M" (for Modify); it should have an "A" (for Add).

The zcDseUpdateHeader setting is located in the Compass tool under Design MA,
Connected Directory, Foreign Entries Output Template, and Header. The
zcDseUpdateAdd setting is located in the Compass tool under Design MA, Connected
Directory, Foreign Entries Output Template, and Add.

RESOLUTION
==========

If your MA does not require a specialized head entry, disable the entries (by
using a "#" character) in zcDseUpdateHeader. In zcDseUpdateAdd, change the first
letter from "M" to "A". Operate your MA; the "A" allows the record to be
presented as an add record to the connected directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
