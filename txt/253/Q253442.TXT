SUMMARY
=======

You need to perform certain steps if you want to use Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 3 Key Management server (KM server) with a Microsoft
Windows 2000 certificate server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 KM server with a Windows 2000
certificate server:

1. Copy the Expolicy.dll file from the Server\Support\Kms\Expolicy\I386 folder
   on the Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 CD to the Winnt\System32 folder on
   the certificate server.

2. From a command prompt on the certificate server, run the following command:

   regsvr32 expolicy.dll

3. From the Certification Authority Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in,
   you need to configure the Certificate Authority to use the Legacy policy
   module instead of the default Enterprise and Stand-Alone policy module. To do
   this:

   a. In MMC, right-click the server name.

   b. Open the server properties.

   c. Click the Policy Module tab, and then click Select.

   d. Click Legacy Policy Module, and then click OK. The properties for the
      server are displayed.

   e. Click OK.

   The following message is displayed:

   You must restart Certificate Services for the changes to take effect. Do you
   want to restart the service now?

   To immediately restart the service, click Yes. To restart the service later,
   click No. After you restart the service, you can use this server to issue
   X.509V3 certificates that are compatible with Exchange Server 5.5 Service
   Pack 3.
