SUMMARY
=======

When a Management agent (MA) is created, the "Write entries to the transactions
stack during synchronization" setting is enabled by default. Microsoft
recommends that you leave this default setting after your MA is fully
operational. Also, you must use this setting to allow updates generated by the
MA to be issued as delta updates by your other MAs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You may need to disable this setting when you are testing your MA. To do so:

1. Log on to Compass with an administrator account.

2. In the Action panel, click Bookmarks, and then click Management Agents.

3. Double-click the appropriate MA.

4. In the Action panel, click Configure MA.

5. Click the Metadirectory Relationships tab.

6. On the Configuration tab, click to clear the "Write entries to the
   transactions stack during synchronization" check box.

7. Click OK.
