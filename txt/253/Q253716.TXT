TITLE   :Event ID 8020: DSMN Cannot Synchronize Users on a NetWare Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Services for NetWare version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Event log, you receive the following error message:

   Event ID 8020
   The synch agent services failed to modify account [username] on the NetWare
   server [servername] due to error 10256. DSMN is not able to synchronize any
   of the users on the NetWare server. Any new user added to NT and migrated to
   NetWare will work fine.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur when the DSMN server tries to synchronize the accounts on
the NetWare server.

The NetWare server refuses the request. The actual NetWare error is 255(xFF).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, you may need to delete the users from NetWare and migrate
them again from Windows NT by fully synchronizing the NetWare server using DSMN.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft recommends that you apply user rights on the NetWare server using
Groups. When you delete a user from the NetWare server and DSMN is synchronized
with that server the user and groups the user was in are added to the server
again. Permissions you assigned to individual users are lost and need to be
reapplied.
