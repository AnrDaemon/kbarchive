TITLE   :BUG: WizardBar Cannot Go to Declaration of Void Functions
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbwizard kbide kbVC kbVC600bug kbDSupport kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the WizardBar to go to the declaration of a class member function that
returns void generates the following message:

   Cannot find the declaration of this function.

RESOLUTION
==========

To navigate to the function declaration that returns void, find the function in
the Class View. Right-click the function and select Go to declaration.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WizardBar is a dockable toolbar that provides instant access to some of the most
powerful features in Visual C++, such as those traditionally available from
ClassWizard, as well as many of the new ClassView functions. WizardBar extends
ClassView functionality by "tracking" your context, updating what's displayed in
the WizardBar toolbar when your focus shifts.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a default MFC AppWizard exe project, such as Test.

2. Open the file TestView.cpp.

3. Position the cursor on the OnDraw() function (or on any other function that
   returns a void).

4. Go to WizardBar and click on the WizardBar action icon or the drop-down list
   box next to it.

5. Select Go to Function Declaration.

The following error message appears:

   Cannot find the declaration of this function.
