SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start the Account Joiner utility, it may stop responding
(hang) with the following error message:

   An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
   generated.

This error message can occur if you use brackets or parentheses in the

parentheses to be illegal characters.
