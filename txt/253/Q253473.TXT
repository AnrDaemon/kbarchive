SUMMARY
=======

From the Systems Management Server (SMS) Administrator console, you can remotely
control a SMS client computer that has the Remote Tools Client agent installed.
When you are controlling a remote computer, multiple program windows may be open
on the target computer and the windows may overlap one another. The arrow button
on the Remote Control window's title bar provides the task switching (ALT+TAB)
function so that you can bring a program window to the foreground.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use this feature:

1. From the SMS Administrator console, open the corresponding collection that
   contains the target computer.

2. In the right pane, right-click the target computer, point to All Tasks, and
   then click Start Remote Tools.

3. When the Remote Tools window opens, click Remote Control on the Tools menu.
   The Remote Control window opens and display the desktop from the target
   computer.

4. To bring a program to the foreground, click the blue arrow button on the
   Remote Control window's title bar. It appears in the "selected" or "down"
   position. While it is selected, press TAB on the keyboard until the program
   that you want to bring to the foreground is selected, and then click the
   arrow button again and release it. The program is displayed in the
   foreground.

5. Repeat step 4 to bring another program to the foreground.
