KEYWORDS:kbSNA400sp4fix kbSNA400PreSP4fix

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, versions 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A recordset that contains strings cannot be sorted when it is returned by COM
Transaction Integrator (COMTI). When you attempt to sort the recordset, the
client application displays the following error message:

   Execution error '-2147217824 (80040e60)': Unable to open requested order

CAUSE
=====

In SNA Server versions 4.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2) and later, the string's data
type is coerced to adLongVarWChar, which makes the recordset unsortable.
Previous to SP2, the data type is coerced to adVarWChar.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
