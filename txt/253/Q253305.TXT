TITLE   :XADM: Exchange Setup Stops w. "Account Information Is Incorrect"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Exchange Server, you must select a service account during the
installation. After you select the account, the Setup program tries to modify
the rights of the account so that it can work as the service account. When the
Setup program attempts to do this, the following error message may be
displayed:

   Account information is incorrect

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the account that you selected does not have the
"Access this computer from the network" user policy right. This policy right is
normally granted to the Everyone group by default during the installation of
Microsoft Windows NT Server, so it is not added to the Exchange Server service
account by default during the Exchange Server installation. The Everyone group
may have been removed from the policy right as a security measure.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

1. Start User Manager for Domains.

2. On the Policies menu, click User Rights.

3. Click to select the "Access this computer from the network" check box. Under
   "Grant to", make sure that the Exchange Server service account is listed or
   belongs to a group that is listed. If not, click Add, and then select the
   Exchange Server service account or a group that the service account belongs
   to.

4. In the "Add Users and Groups" dialog box, click OK.

5. In the User Rights Policy dialog box, click OK.
