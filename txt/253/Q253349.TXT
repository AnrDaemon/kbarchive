TITLE   :XCON: Response Files from GroupWise Are Put in Badfiles Folder
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you receive Directory Synchronization Service (DXA) response files from
Novell GroupWise, some of the files are randomly routed to the Badfiles folder.
The DXA process may stop responding for an hour if the response file is
inappropriately moved to the Badfiles folder and the connector is not manually
restarted.

CAUSE
=====

When the DXA response file is locked down by the application programming
interface (API) gateway for writing, the router service tries to pick the
response file up. The pickup does not work, so the router tries to move the
response file to the Badfiles folder, which also does not work. This cycle
repeats every 8 seconds. Eventually the API gateway releases the files and the
router moves the response file to the Badfiles folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
