on multiple clients simultaneously, the following error message may be

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Pcm.mac file is a compressed version of PCMMAC. Use the Hdecomp tool
included with SMS to decompress this file to a volume that supports Macintosh
files (such as NTFS).

The Pcmupd.mac file is a compressed version of a special Vise updater bundle
containing PCMMAC. Use the Hdecomp tool to extract this file, which generates a
Pcmupdater file. Run the resulting file to view its Readme file, and then apply
the update to the local computer.
