TITLE   :Using the $Search() Function in a Management Agent of MMS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool MMS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Prior to Microsoft Metadirectory Services 2.1 when the metascript $Search()
function performed a search and found zero or multiple matches, it would return
a null value. This mechanism was unsatisfactory in situations where you needed
to determine the uniqueness of an entry based on a search criterion.

CAUSE
=====

The $search() function would return a NULL value if more than one entry was
located by the search. A new argument, returnArbitraryResponse, was added to
signal the fact that more than one entry was located. This now provides a means
to determine the uniqueness of entries matching a particular search criterion.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, this $search() functionality was modified in MMS 2.1.
Upgrade to Microsoft Metadirectory Services 2.1 to receive this modification.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The $search() function has been modified. The new syntax to this function is:

$search(whatToSearch, scope, base, returnArbitraryResponse)

Where returnArbitraryResponse is optional and has a default value of NULL for
backward compatibility. If returnArbitraryResponse is set to "arbitrary", the
$search() function returns an arbitrary set of search results when multiple
responses are found; it will no longer return a NULL. Management Agent
developers can then use this argument to signal that more than one match was
found, and that the entry being searched for is not unique.

No changes are required for existing templates if you do not require this
functionality.
