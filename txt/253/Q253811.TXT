TITLE   :Connect Requests Not Seen on All Interfaces on Multihomed Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0 SP5,4.0 SP6,4.0 SP6a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a multihomed computer tries to connect to another remote computer, not all
of the adapters resolve the name to the IP address specified in lmhost file.
Also, this occurs even if the remote computer name is in the lmhost file with
#PRE. Name Query request might still be sent out on some interfaces, and if
there is no response, connect requests may not be sent on all interfaces.

CAUSE
=====

The behavior is due to a regression on an enhancement done to NetBT as explained
in Q216471 - NetBT Improvements for Connections Between Multihomed Computers.
