TITLE   :Last Foreign User Update Time Appears Not to Be Updated
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a management agent (MA) that processes foreign users, the
zcdsLastExportTime setting remains set to a previous date. In some situations,
the MA processes only 2,000 transactions in a single run and export only 1,000
records. The zcdsLastExportTime setting is only slightly incremented and appears
to be "stuck" on a single date. When you run the MA concurrently, approximately
1,000 records are processed each time, picking up where the previous MA run left
off.

CAUSE
=====

The Importt tool is reading only a portion of the transactions and quitting.
Importt is not able to recover for the next set of 2,000 transactions without
running the MA again.


RESOLUTION
==========

This issue has been resolved with a patch. Please contact Technical Support for
a fix or upgrade to Microsoft Metadirectory Services (MMS) 2.2.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
