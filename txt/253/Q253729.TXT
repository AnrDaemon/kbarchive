TITLE   :Stopping Persistent Connection Causes It to Become Unavailable
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Stopping the reconnection of a persistent connection during the logon process
can cause that network drive to become permanently unavailable. Subsequent
attempts to connect to the drive may generate the following error message:

   An error occurred while connecting to <X>: the local device name is
   already in use.

Logging off and logging back on in the same Terminal Server session does not
resolve the issue.
