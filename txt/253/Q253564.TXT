TITLE   :XFOR: GroupWise Migration Creates Duplicate Folders in Outlook
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you migrate a Novell GroupWise mailbox to Exchange Server 5.5, when you
open the new Exchange Server mailbox in Microsoft Outlook, there may be multiple
default folders. For example, the new Exchange Server mailbox may contain the
following folders:

 - Calendar

 - Calendar1

 - Tasks

 - Tasks1

 - Journal

 - Journal1

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the GroupWise user gained access to the GroupWise
mailbox by using Outlook. When Outlook opens the GroupWise mailbox, Outlook
creates the default Outlook folders (Tasks, Journal, Calendar, and so on) in the
user's mailbox in the Novell server message store. When you migrate these
folders from GroupWise to Exchange Server, they are treated as regular folders.
When you start Outlook to gain access to the new Exchange Server mailbox,
Outlook creates the default Outlook folders. A naming conflict occurs, and
Outlook renames the default folders.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Before you migrate GroupWise mailboxes, have the GroupWise users open their
   mailboxes by using the default Novell GroupWise client and delete any default
   Outlook folders.

2. Delete the migrated GroupWise folders from Outlook after you migrate the
   GroupWise mailboxes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5.
