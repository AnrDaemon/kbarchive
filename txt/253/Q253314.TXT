SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Terminal Server client from either a workstation or the server
to connect through a Windows NT Terminal Server that has SNA Server 4.0 client
for Windows NT installed, the following error message may occur when trying to
establish a 3270 session:

   SnaBase not started

The 3270 screen may also be blank with no errors logged in the event log on the
client, the Terminal Server, or the SNA Server. The 3270 applet is able to
establish a connection if you run it directly from the Terminal Server.

CAUSE
=====

The compatibility script included on the Terminal Server CD for SNA Server is
not compatible with SNA Server 4.0 SP2 and SP3.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the correct compatibility script that corresponds to the SNA Server service
pack that is installed.
