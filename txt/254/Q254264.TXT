TITLE   :XADM: Autoforwarding Rule to a Deleted Custom Recipient NDRs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If a user creates an autoforwarding rule that forwards e-mail messages from a
mailbox to a custom recipient and that custom recipient is deleted, non-delivery
reports (NDRs) are sent to the mailbox of the e-mail message originator and an
event ID 290 that refers to the deleted address of the custom recipient is
logged in the Windows NT Event Viewer application event log.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To verify that a user has an autoforwarding rule that uses a deleted custom
recipient and fix that autoforwarding rule:

1. From the mailbox of the user, send an e-mail message that is addressed to
   that same user. If the e-mail message arrives in the user's Inbox and an NDR
   similar to the following is sent to the same Inbox, proceed to the next step:

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

   Public, John Q. on 2/10/00 9:54 AM

   The recipient name is not recognized

   The MTS-ID of the original message is: c=US;a=XXXX
   ;p=XXXXX;l=ServerName-000210145404Z-7928
   MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:intl:ServerName

2. In the application event log on the server that the user's mailbox is homed
   on, look for an event ID 290 similar to the following that was logged at the
   same time that the NDR appeared in the user's mailbox:

   Event Type: Warning
   Event Source: MSExchangeMTA
   Event Category: X.400 Service
   Event ID: 290

   Description:
   A non-delivery report (reason code unable-to-transfer and diagnostic code
   unrecognised-OR-name) is being generated for message
   C=US;A=ADMINDOM;P=DOMAIN;L=MSG05INT-000128154450Z-35477. It was originally
   destined for DN:/o=DOMAIN/ou=INTL/cn=Recipients/cn=PUBLICJ§ (recipient number
   1), and was to be redirected to . [MTA DISP:RESULT 18 136] (12)

3. Use the address in the NDR to find the autoforwarding rule on the user's
   mailbox that is generating the NDRs by logging on to the user's mailbox and
   finding the address that is in the NDR attached to one of the autoforwarding
   rules.

4. When you find the address, remove it from the autoforwarding rule, and then
   attempt to re-add the address from the global address list. If you cannot
   re-add the address, perform one of the following steps, as applicable:

    - Remove the autoforwarding rule from the mailbox.

    - Recreate the custom recipient and reassociate that address with the rule.

Additional query words: auto forward rule; recipient name is not recognized GAL
