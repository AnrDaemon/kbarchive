======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MapPoint 2002 
 - Microsoft MapPoint 2001 
 - Microsoft Streets & Trips 2002, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Streets and Trips 2001 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you press the F1 key to open the online Help window in Microsoft Streets
and Trips 2001 or Microsoft MapPoint 2001, Help topics may not be displayed in
the language that you expect.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the following conditions are true:

 - You previously installed a different localized version of the program on your
   computer.

 - The version of the Hhctrl.ocx file that is installed on your computer is the
   same version or a newer version than the file that is installed by the
   program.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. Insert the Setup CD-ROM into your CD-ROM Drive. Press and hold down the SHIFT
   key when you insert the CD-ROM to prevent Setup from starting automatically.

2. Click Start, and then click Run.

3. In the Open box, type the following line, and then click OK

   <drive>:\msmap\redist\htmlhelp\hhupd.exe

   where <drive> is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive.

NOTE: After you perform these steps, the HTML Help topics for all of the programs
that are installed on your computer are displayed in the same language.
