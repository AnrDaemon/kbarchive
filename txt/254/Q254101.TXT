SUMMARY
=======

There are network adapters and accompanying drivers available from some hardware
manufacturers to provide fault tolerance. This technology allows you to group
network adapter ports for a connection to a single physical segment. If
connectivity through one port is not working, another port is activated
automatically. This operation is transparent to the operating system and other
devices on the network.

Support for the fault-tolerant technology (the hardware and the drivers) is
provided by the hardware manufacturer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The use of teaming on the private interconnect of a server cluster is not
supported because of delays that could possibly occur in the transmission and
receipt of heartbeat packets between the nodes. For best results when you want
redundancy for the private interconnect, disable teaming and use the available
ports to form a second private interconnect. This achieves the same end result
and provides dual, robust communication paths for the nodes to communicate
over.

Using teaming on the public or client networks is acceptable. However, if
problems or issues seem to be related to teaming, Microsoft Product Support
Services will require that teaming be disabled. If this resolves the problem or
issue, you must seek assistance from the hardware manufacturer.


For more information, see the online documentation about hardware compatibility
tests on the Microsoft Web site.
