TITLE   :XADM: Slow Information Store Startup From Public Folder Cleanup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix kbgraphxlinkcritical

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server Information Store service may take a considerable
amount of time to start (under certain conditions, up to several hours).

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the information store shutdown process places an
inconsistent flag on the database, regardless of whether the database is shut
down cleanly or not. This causes any restrictions or views in the database that
are based on read/unread counts to be deleted. If enough restrictions or views
have built up in the database, this deletion process can take a considerable
amount of time

The deletion process is required because read/unread counts for the public
information store are cached. If the information store does not shut down
cleanly, the read/unread counts in the database may be out of synchronization
with the cached restrictions, which can cause errors and instability.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
