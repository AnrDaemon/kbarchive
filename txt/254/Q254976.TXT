TITLE   :XCON: MIXER Does Not Map SMTP Subdomains to Organizational Units
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you have configured the Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA) to map
between SMTP addresses and X.400 addresses according to the following Microsoft
Knowledge Base article:

   Q238507 XCON: Exchange Server Message Transfer Agent MIXER Mapping Tables

the subdomains of the SMTP address may not be mapped to organizational unit (OU)
attributes in the X.400 O/R address.

For example, the following entry in the Mcgam.in.txt file maps "eur.fr" to
"C=FR;A=ADMD;P=PRMD":

   eur.fr#prmd$PRMD.admd$ADMD.c$FR#

A message that is addressed to user@dept.area.eur.fr should then be converted to
an X.400 message that is addressed to C=FR;A=ADMD;P=PRMD;O=area;OU1=dept, but
the actual mapping is to C=FR;A=ADMD;P=PRMD;O=area. No OUs are mapped.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the Exchange Server MTA contains a logic error that
causes the generated OU values to be overwritten.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 3. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server
5.5 Service Pack 4.
