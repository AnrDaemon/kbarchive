TITLE   :XADM: How to Move the Directory Replication Connector
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5

KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You may need to move a directory replication connector to a different Exchange
Bridgehead server in a site. This article outlines this process.

NOTE: A full refresh of all replicated contexts is automatically triggered (both
ways). You may prefer a full refresh to removal of the directory replication
connector in some cases. If you remove the directory replication connector, you
must also remove the adjacent connector. Before you can re-add a replication
connector, you must successfully complete a knowledge consistency check on both
directories. This deletes the objects that have been replicated between the two
sites.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To move the directory replication connector to a different Exchange Bridgehead
server:

1. In the local site:

   a. Open the Exchange Server Administrator program and connect to the current
      bridgehead server.

   b. Click to expand the Organization container, click to expand the Site
      container, click to expand the Configuration container, and then click the
      Directory Replication object.

   c. In the right pane, click the directory replication connector that you want
      to move to a different server, and then open the properties of the
      directory replication connector.

   d. On the General tab, click the new server name in the "Local bridgehead
      server" list, click Apply, and then click Yes.

2. In the remote site:

   a. Open the Exchange Server Administrator program and connect to the current
      bridgehead server.

   b. Click to expand the Organization container, click to expand the Site
      container, click to expand the Configuration container, and then click the
      Directory Replication object.

   c. In the right pane, click the same directory replication connector for
      which you changed the server in the local site steps, and then open the
      properties of the directory replication connector.

   d. On the General tab, click the same server name that you selected in the
      local site steps above in the "Remote bridgehead server" list, click
      Apply, and then click Yes twice.

NOTE: You may not need to perform the remote site steps if the Remote bridgehead
server listed in the remote site is automatically updated after you performed
the preceding local site steps.
