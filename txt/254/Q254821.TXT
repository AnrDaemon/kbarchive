TITLE   :XADM: Re-establishing ADC Connection Agreement Deletes Objects
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:; winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In some cases, tearing down and re-establishing an Active Directory Connector
(ADC) Connection Agreement becomes necessary. If objects were deleted from a
directory while the Connection Agreement was down and deletions are enabled on
the newly created Connection Agreement, these objects will be deleted in the
connected directory after the Connection Agreement is reestablished.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When objects are deleted from a Windows 2000 or an Exchange Server directory,
tombstones are generated for the deleted objects. When the Connection Agreement
is re-established and deletions are enabled, these tombstones are replicated to
the connected directory, and the objects are deleted.

A natural tendency in resolving directory discrepancies is to break and
re-establish the Connection Agreement. A better first course of action is to
click All Tasks->Replicate Now on the Connection Agreement. If this does not
resolve the issue, try setting the Replicate entire directory flag on the
Connection Agreement. If you need to break and then re-establish the Connection
Agreement, click the option to store the deletion list in a .csv file to ensure
that only objects intended for deletion are removed.
