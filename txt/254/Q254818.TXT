TITLE   :XCON: MTA Stops Processing E-Mail over X.400 Conn. w. Event 9156
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

KEYWORDS:exc55sp3 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The message transfer agent (MTA) may stop delivering e-mail messages over an
X.400 Connector. As a result, the X.400 queues of the MTA may back up.
Eventually e-mail messages generate non-delivery reports (NDRs), which contain a
reason code that indicates MTA congestion.

This issue only occurs on Exchange Server computers that have a local time zone
set to 30 minutes offset. For example, servers in Tehran, Iran are set for +
3:30 Greenwich mean time, which is at a 30 minute offset from the full hour, as
compared to servers in Nairobi, Kenya, which are set at + 3:00 Greenwich mean
time, which is a complete full hour offset. The following Event IDs from the MTA
may be logged in the application event log:

   Event ID 4282
   An interoperability error occurred. Interface protocol was violated. Error
   code=8453, Control Block index=96 [POP4 MAIN BASE 1 18] (14)

   Event ID 4284
   A error occurred during connection/disconnection. Error code: 8511 [0 POP4
   POP4 DOWN 6] (14)

   Event ID 4287
   An internal MTA error occurred. Contact Microsoft Technical Support. Error
   code=8640 [64 POP4 POP4 DOWN 6] (14)

   Event ID 290
   A non-delivery report (reason code transfer-failure and diagnostic code
   MTS-congestion) is being generated for message C=US;A= ;P=Microsoft;
   L=Server1-000114132344Z-648. It was originally destined for
   DN:/o=Microsoft/ou=LC/cn=Recipients/cn=mnadeem§ (recipient number 1) and was
   to be redirected to DN:/o=Microsoft/ou=LC/cn=RECIPIENTS/ cn=mnadeem§C=US;
   ;P=Microsoft;S=Nadeem;G=M;. [MTA DISP:RESULT 22 136] (12)

   Event ID 9156
   A resource limit has been reached while attempting to open an association.
   There are no free control blocks available for network type 1. The configured
   count is 20. [BASE IL MAIN BASE 1 171] (10)

CAUSE
=====

In MTA build 5.5.2580.0, the MTA was changed to use coordinated universal time
(UTC) rather than local time in a number of places, to avoid local time and
daylight saving time issues. For additional information, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q225345 XCON: MTA Mishandles Deferred Delivery Messages After Daylight
   Savings Time Changes

The Timer Checking routine compared the last time that Timer control blocks (CBs)
were checked by using system time. The Timer CB setup routine read the last
check time by using local time. Generally this inconsistency did not cause a
issue, because the MTA only looks for seconds differences, so any difference in
hours was cancelled out.

However, with certain times, for example, Greenwich mean time + 5:30, the system
time and local time are out by 1800 seconds. This causes all of the timer CBs to
think that they have been running for 30 minutes plus the real run time and they
time out in 0 seconds.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, system time must be used consistently when the MTA
calculates the time differences. For additional information about the latest
service pack for Exchange Server 5.5, click the article number below to view the

   Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, use one of the following two methods:

 - In the Schedule tab of the X.400 properties, change the connector schedule to
   the "Remote initiated" setting, and then stop and restart the MTA.

 - Set the system local time zone to a full hour offset, for example, if the
   server is in Darwin, Australia, change the system local time from + 9:30
   Greenwich mean time to + 9:00 Greenwich mean time. Then restart the server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 3. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server
5.5 Service Pack 4.
