TITLE   :PRB: Err Msg: "Access Is Denied" When Client Accesses ASP Page
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOSWin2000 kbDSupport kbIIS kbiis400

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When clients connect to Internet Information Server and attempt to view an
Active Server Pages (ASP) page, they may receive the following error message:

   Error: Access is denied

HTML pages do not generate the same error from within the same folder.

CAUSE
=====

The problem happens because the user account or anonymous account does not have
the correct permissions to run an ASP application.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem, give the user account or anonymous account read
permissions to the root folder of the Web site or the folder that contains the
ASP page.

WORKAROUND
==========

If this problem occurs, a way to work around it is to "create" the application
under the admin account. To do so, go into the Internet Service manager,
right-click the folder where the ASP page resides, and choose Properties. Select
the Directory tab, and then click Create.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem occurs if the account used does not have the right permissions for
the folder where the top application is running. If the default Web site is
pointing to Wwwroot and the folder Testdir is under Wwwroot, the user account
might have permissions to read Testdir but not Wwwroot. When the user calls an
ASP page under Testdir, Internet Information Server will look for the first
available application along the hierarchy. The first one it finds is for
Wwwroot. Because the account does not have read permissions to Wwwroot, the user
receives the error message. Giving permissions for the account to Wwwroot or
creating an application to Testdir both solve the problem.
