This form demonstrates how to use the ProgressBar control. The code examples
provided in the ProgressBar Help file are all written in Microsoft Visual Basic.
This example translates the Visual Basic code into Visual FoxPro code. The
essential functionality of the examples is not changed, but some additional code
is added to more clearly demonstrate certain functionality.

To run the form, do the following:

1. Download the self-extracting executable file and expand the Progbar form and
   Readme.txt files.

2. Run the form.

3. Click the Run Example command button. The segmented ProgressBar appears
   horizontally across the top to the form.

4. Click the Toggle Scrolling button to change the Scrolling property to Smooth,
   and click the Run Example command button again.

5. Click the Change Orientation button and then click the Run Example command
   button. Note that the ProgressBar now appears along the left-hand side of the
   form.

6. Click the Toggle Scrolling button and then click the Run Example command
   button. Note that the ProgressBar now appears along the left-hand side of the
   form, but it appears segmented.
