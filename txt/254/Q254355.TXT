TITLE   :Access to Internet Services Manager Limited to Localhost
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOSWin2000 kbIIS kbiis400 kbiis500

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a user attempts to remotely connect to the IISADMIN virtual directory (or
possibly some other administrative share) of either the default Web site or the
Administrative Web site on an Internet Information Services Server 4.0 or
Internet Information Services 5.0 server, the connection fails, and the
following error message appears in the browser:

   Access to Internet Services Manager (HTML) is restricted to Localhost

CAUSE
=====

The reason for this error is that permissions for that virtual directory, by
default, restrict access to only those persons actually logged on to the local
computer, not people connecting across the network.

RESOLUTION
==========

Permissions to this folder (or any administrative virtual directory) should not
be adjusted without great care because they can allow a high degree of control
over the Web Server.

NOTE: You are strongly discouraged from changing these attributes because of the
security implications.

You can use this procedure too allow or change access to the IISADMIN directory:

1. Right-click the folder and select Properties.

2. On the Directory Security tab, click the Edit button for IP Address and
   Domain Name Restrictions.

3. Adjust the settings to match your security needs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Another way that you can delegate permissions is to make a copy of the IISADMIN
Web site and place it into the directory structure of the Web sites that are
being hosted on this server. This allows the administrator to delegate control
to some other person. Again, the Directory Security must be amended to open up
access beyond the local computer.

Additional query words: IIS 5, permissions, iisadmin
