PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbMDI kbVBp kbVBp600 kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an MDI child form with a control is maximized, and another child form is
created while the top child window is closed, the control on the original child
form loses focus.

CAUSE
=====

When the new child form is closed, the original form gets the focus instead of
the control. The GotFocus event of the original form fires.

RESOLUTION
==========

Step-by-Step Workaround
-----------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Set the MDIChild property of Form1 to True.

3. Add a TextBox to Form1.

4. From the Project menu, add an MDI form to the project.

5. From the Tools menu, select Menu Editor and create a menu item on the MDI
   form with the caption "New Form" (without the quotation marks) and name it
   "mnuNew" (without the quotation marks).

6. Add the following code to the MDI form:

   Private Sub mnuNew_Click()
       Dim tmpView As Form1
       Set tmpView = New Form1 
       tmpView.Caption = "New Form"
       tmpView.Show
   End Sub

7. Add the following code to the General Declarations area of Form1:

   Dim ctlFocus As Object

   Private Sub Form_Deactivate()
   Set ctlFocus = Me.ActiveControl
   End Sub

   Private Sub Form_GotFocus() 
   ' Comment out the next two lines to reproduce behavior
   MsgBox "form got focus"
   ctlFocus.SetFocus
   End Sub

8. Run the project and maximize Form1. The TextBox, Text1, has focus.

9. Click on the MDI menu New Form. A new form is created. Close the new form.

10. A message box indicates that the original form received the focus. Click OK.
   Focus is now set to the ActiveControl of the original form.

11. Comment out the specified lines and repeat the steps above to see the
   problem reproduced.
