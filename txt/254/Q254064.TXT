TITLE   :XFOR: Connector for SNADS Delivery Receipt Fails in SP2 and SP3
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5 SP2,5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2 exc55sp3 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message from an Exchange Server computer and select delivery
receipt properties, if the Exchange Server version 5.5 Service Pack 2 (SP2) or
Service Pack 3 (SP3) version of the Microsoft Exchange Connector for SNADS is
installed, delivery receipt does not occur. Computers running Exchange Server
5.5 or Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1 do not experience this issue.

CAUSE
=====

In Exchange Server 5.5 SP2 and SP3, all of the time records are stored in
Greenwich mean time. However, SNADS keeps its CT records based on the Composed
Date/Time field in the local time zone, so directory replication does not match
any record in SNADS.

RESOLUTION
==========

When Exchange Server creates the data block that is saved in the CT record,
Exchange Server stores the original composed date and time as it was received
from SNADS. To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange
Server 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.
