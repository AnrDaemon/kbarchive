TITLE   :XADM: Rehoming Public Folders Adds Number to End of SMTP Address
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you rehome a public folder between two sites that share the same address
space (for example, microsoft.com), the directory object that represents that
folder exists in two places for a brief period of time.

When this duplication occurs, the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) address on
the destination server has a number added to the end of the SMTP address prefix.
For example, "PublicFolder@microsoft.com" becomes "PublicFolder2@microsoft.com."

MORE INFORMATION
================

A duplication of the directory object that represents the public folder on the
source server occurs in the Recipients container (or the default public folder
container designated on the General tab of the Site Information Store
Configuration object) of the destination site. The original object and the new
object coexist in the directory for the period of time that it takes to complete
replication. The change in the SMTP address of the public folder occurs because
the design of the Exchange Server directory prevents duplication of addresses
within an organization.

After you rehome the public folder and inter-site replication removes the
original SMTP address from the directory of the organization, you must manually
change the SMTP address of the folder back to the correct address.

For example, if a folder named "faxes" exists in the Dallas site with an SMTP
address of "faxes@microsoft.com," and you rehome it to the Atlanta site, the
SMTP address of the folder becomes "faxes2@microsoft.com."

However, if the two sites had SMTP suffixes (which is the Exchange default) such
as "atlanta.microsoft.com" and "dallas.microsoft.com," this would not be a
consideration.
