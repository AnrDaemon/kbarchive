-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you customize the Toolbox by using the Microsoft Visual Basic Editor in
Outlook Forms Designer, you cannot reset the Toolbox to the default
configuration.

CAUSE
=====

After you customize the Toolbox, there is no built-in method to reset the
Toolbox.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you customized the Toolbox by adding pages or ActiveX controls or by deleting
the standard controls, and you want to reset the Toolbox to its original
configuration, perform the following steps:

1. Quit Outlook.

2. Click the Start button, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

3. Click the "Name and Location" tab, and then in the Named box, type
   "Outlook.box" (without the quotation marks).

4. In the "Look in" list, select the drive in which you installed Outlook.

5. Click Find Now.

6. In the search results window at the bottom of the Find dialog box, click
   Outlook.box, and then rename the file (for example, to Outlook.bbb).

When you restart Outlook and start Forms Designer, the Toolbox contains only the
Controls page, and all of the default controls are displayed on the page.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, the Controls page of the Toolbox in Forms Designer contains the
following controls (selected objects):

 - Label
 - TextBox
 - ComboBox
 - ListBox
 - CheckBox
 - OptionButton
 - ToggleButton
 - Frame
 - CommandButton
 - TabStrip
 - MultiPage
 - ScrollBar
 - SpinButton
 - Image
 - RefEdit

You can also export a page from the Toolbox as a .pag file. If you export a page
from the Toolbox, you can import it back to the Toolbox after you reset the
Toolbox to the default configuration.

To export a page from your Toolbox, perform the following steps:

1. Right-click the tab for the page that you want to export.

2. On the shortcut menu, click Export Page.

   "File name" box, type a file name.

4. Click Save.

This method saves the file with a .pag extension in the specified folder.

   shortcut menu.
