TITLE   :Problems Using ISM (HTML) to Create & View Virtual Directory
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOSWin2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the browser-based Internet Services Manager (ISM) to create a
virtual directory that uses an extended character in its name, the following
problems occur:

 - The Local path text box is blank.
 - The Read, Log visits, and Index this resource check boxes are not selected
   (checked).
 - A Web application based on the virtual directory does not appear to have been
   created (although it actually has been created).
 - The Execute permissions and Application Protection drop-down lists are too
   small, and are not populated.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the IIS snap-in version of the ISM to correctly view and modify the
settings.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Services version 5.0.
