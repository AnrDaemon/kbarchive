The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Streets and Trips 2001 
 - Microsoft Streets & Trips 2002, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft MapPoint 2001 
 - Microsoft MapPoint 2002

SUMMARY
=======

When you use a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver with either of the
programs listed at the beginning of this article, you may encounter the
following symptoms:

 - The GPS icon may drift even though you remain stationary.

 - The GPS icon may appear in an unexpected location, such as over water.

These symptoms can occur for a variety of reasons. The most common causes are
discussed in the "More Information" section of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Signal Strength
---------------

GPS signal strength may be insufficient to produce an accurate result. The GPS
receiver may also be searching for available satellites with a stronger signal.

Incorrect Map Datum
-------------------

The map information in the Microsoft programs listed at the beginning of this
article is generally based on the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS-84) map
datum.

Because of the methods these programs use to display map information, there may
be a discrepancy between the displayed position of a point on the map and the
actual latitude and longitude of the point based on the WGS-84 map datum.

Some Global Positioning System (GPS) instruments can be configured to use
different map data for their basic map functions. To obtain the best results
with Microsoft programs that support GPS input, configure your GPS receiver to
use the WGS-84 map datum.

Signal Updates
--------------

Because the products listed at the beginning of this article poll the GPS
receiver for positioning data every 15 seconds, the GPS icon may appear to lag
behind your actual position.
