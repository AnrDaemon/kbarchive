TITLE   :INFO: HLP Files Not Supported on 64-Bit Windows

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Driver writers may provide driver Help files in Windows Help (*.hlp) format.
However, because Windows Help was written to run on a 16-bit code base and does
not support Unicode, it displays garbage characters for languages that use an
extended character set (for example, Eastern European and Far Eastern
languages). Further, Windows Help is not supported on the 64-bit code base.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft recommends that driver providers convert their help files to HTML Help
(*.chm) format. This new HTML Help format is supported both on 32-bit and 64-bit
code bases.
