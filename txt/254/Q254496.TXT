-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The PrintImage method of the Image Edit control simply uses the system default
printer, and does not provide an option to change printers or to change
settings. This article describes how to make these changes by using the
ImageAdmin control.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Wang (Kodak) controls, including ImageEdit and ImageAdmin, do not ship with
Visual Basic, but are included with some versions of Microsoft Windows. The
later versions of the Wang controls are renamed as the Kodak controls.

Step by Step Example
--------------------

Please note that you need to change the .Image property below to a file that is
available on your computer.

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. From the Project menu, select Components, check either the Wang Image Edit
   control or the Kodak Image Edit control, and then click OK.

3. From the Project menu, select Components, check either the Wang Image Admin
   control or the Kodak Image Admin control, and then click OK.

4. Add an instance of the Wang (Kodak) Image Edit control to Form1.

5. Add an instance of the Wang (Kodak) Image Admin control to Form1.

6. Add a CommandButton to the form.

7. Add the following code to the form:

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
       With ImgEdit1
           ' change <myfile> to a file on your system
           .Image = "<myfile>"
           .Display
           ImgAdmin1.Image = .Image
           ImgAdmin1.ShowPrintDialog Form1.hWnd
           .PrintImage 1, 1, 0
       End With
   End Sub

8. Run the project and click Command1. You should see the printer dialog, and
   the image should print with the options and printer you selected.
