SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes offers three options to handle
the conversion of a Notes doclink: as a Rich Text Format (RTF) attachment, an
OLE document link, or a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) shortcut.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you select the option to use a URL shortcut, a message from Notes is sent
that includes a Notes doclink. This doclink points to a document in a database
on a Notes Domino server (other than the Notes Domino server to which Exchange
Server is directly connected); the doclink points to the database on the
original Notes Domino server from which the document was linked.

Simply put, the Notes doclink is not handled dynamically, and the URL that
results points to the original document in the original database on the original
Notes Domino server that the Notes sender pointed the doclink to.
