TITLE   :PRB: Visual FoxPro Setup Wizard Does Not Include the Vbame.dll F
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbwizard kbAppSetup kbvfp600 kbvfp600bug kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You use the setup wizard to install a Visual FoxPro application on a Hebrew
version of Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows NT on a computer that
has never had Visual FoxPro previously installed. When you launch the
application, the following error occurs:

   "An invalid page fault has occurred in VFP6r.dll..."

CAUSE
=====

The Visual FoxPro 6.0 Setup Wizard fails to include the required file,
Vbame.dll, a Middle East support file.

RESOLUTION
==========

As a workaround to this problem, you can do the following:

1. Copy the Vbame.dll file from the \Vfp98\Distrib.src\System folder to the
   distribution files folder (that is, the distribution files directory entered
   at step 1 of the setup wizard).

2. At step 6 of the setup wizard (that is, Change File Settings), ensure that
   the Vbame.dll file was included and change the Target Dir from AppDir to
   WinSysDir.

Now when the installation program executes, it installs the Vbame.dll file into
the Windows System folder.
