The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you send an e-mail message to an invalid domain name that contains a trailing
space (for example, SMTP:joeuser@invaliddomain.com ), a non-delivery report
(NDR) that indicates an invalid host is generated as expected. But if you click
Send Again, you do not receive an additional NDR message. Instead, the Internet
Mail Service logs the following event 4120 error message, and moves the message
into the Archive folder:

   Event Type: Error
   Event Source: MSExchangeIMC
   Event Category: Internal Processing
   Event ID: 4120
   Date: 1/11/2000
   Time: 3:17:57 PM
   User: N/A
   Computer: BACON610
   Description:
   In the process of creating a notification of delivery failure to the sender of
   a message, an error occurred causing the notification to be aborted. The
   sender is not informed that his original message failed to be delivered.

==========
