TITLE   :XADM: Rules Do Not Work When Using Custom Recipient from the GAL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix kbgraphxlinkcritical

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a rule in Microsoft Outlook 2000 to process new e-mail messages
from a custom global address list recipient (SMTP) that is not in the
organization and you configure the rule to forward the e-mail messages to
another custom global address list recipient (SMTP) that is not in the
organization, the rule does not work and Event ID 1033 is written to the
application log.

CAUSE
=====

When you create the rule the information store uses the Distinguished Name (DN)
internally to compare the addresses, instead of both the SMTP proxy address and
the DN.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
