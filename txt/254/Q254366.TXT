TITLE   :WD97: Inserted Excel Worksheet Object Too Large for Word Page
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word8 word97

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a Microsoft Excel Worksheet in a Word document, the worksheet
cells may be too large and the worksheet may not fit on the page.


CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the standard font size in Microsoft Excel has been
changed to a large font size.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, change the standard font size in Microsoft Excel to a
smaller size before you insert the Excel worksheet. To do this, follow these
steps:

1. Start Microsoft Excel.

2. On the Tools menu, click Options.

3. On the General tab, change the Size box to 10.

4. Click OK.

5. On the File menu, click Exit to quit Microsoft Excel.

NOTE: If you have an existing Microsoft Excel Worksheet embedded in a Word
document that is experiencing this problem, changing the standard font size in
Microsoft Excel will not affect the worksheet. To resolve this problem, you must
delete the existing worksheet in your Word document and then insert a new one
after you make the changes in Microsoft Excel.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
