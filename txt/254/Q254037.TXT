TITLE   :XFOR: Access Violation Occurs in Nnotes.dll w/ Lotus Notes 4.6a
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the Exchange Server Migration Wizard and the Lotus Notes 4.6a Client to
migrate from Lotus Notes may cause an access violation to occur in Nnotes.dll.

CAUSE
=====

This is a rare and extreme situation which occurs when a buffer allocated from
heap memory ends exactly at the end of a memory page and the next address points
to memory that is not readable. The Notes API call, DNCanonicalize, is reading
one byte past the end of the string. In this case, the string is terminated on a
page boundary, which causes the access violation.



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, use Lotus Notes 5.x or later clients with the
Exchange Migration Wizard when you migrate from Lotus Notes.
