TITLE   :PRB: Can't Add T-SQL Debugger to the Visual Basic Add-in Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbTSQL kbVBp600 kbGrpDSVBDB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After Installing Visual Basic 6.0 Enterprise Edition and the Enterprise Tools,
the T-SQL Debugger may not be listed as an available add-in in the Visual Basic
Add-in Manager.

CAUSE
=====

The current user is not logged in as the same user who installed Visual Basic.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The typical (default) installation of the Visual Studio/Visual Basic 6.0
Enterprise edition installs the TSQL Debugger client-side components. These
components, however, are not installed if the Enterprise Tools option is cleared
when you perform a custom installation. The T-SQL Debugger client-side
components and .dll files are installed in the following folder:

   drive:\Microsoft Visual studio installation directory\VB98\TSQL

If the T-SQL Debugger entry is not listed in the Add-in Manager after you install
Visual Basic and the Enterprise Tools, verify that the add-in components have
been installed correctly:

1. Make sure that the following files are present in the TSQL folder:

    - Vbsdiadd.dll

    - Vbsdidb.dll

    - Vbsdicli.exe

   If you do not see the TSQL folder or the mentioned files in your Visual Basic
   installation directory, then rerun the Visual Basic (or Microsoft Visual
   Studio) installation program. Be sure to select custom from the installation
   dialog box, and then choose Select All for the Enterprise Tools selection.

   After completing the installation, restart the system and check to see if the
   Visual Basic Add-in Manager lists the T-SQL Debugger.

2. If the TSQL folder and the listed files are there, then try reregistering the
   Vbsdiadd.dll and Vbsdidb.dll files, and then check to see if the T-SQL
   Debugger add-in is listed in the Visual Basic Add-in Manager.
