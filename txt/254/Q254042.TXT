======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you apply the Dial-Up Networking (DUN) 1.3 update to a Windows 95-based
computer, the Services file is overwritten. The Services file is also
overwritten when you reinstall network components such as protocols or network
adapter drivers.

The Services file is located in the Windows folder. It is used to store network
resource mapping information such as drives, printers, and ports. Network
administrators may prefer to have a modified Services file preserved under all
circumstances. This article describes how you can prevent the customized
Services file from being overwritten during network component installation.

CAUSE
=====

When you install network components such as DUN 1.3, a new copy of the Services
file is extracted from the Windows cabinet file to the Windows folder, where it
overwrites any existing modified Services file. This is the default behavior in
Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can prevent your custom Services file from being overwritten when you
install network components by modifying a line in the Nettrans.inf file at the
installation source.

Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to edit the Nettrans.inf file. Locate the
[MSTCP.CopyFiles.win] section in the file, and then modify the Services file
entry in the Nettrans.inf file as follows:

   services,,,16,

"16" is a flag that indicates that the file should not be overwritten if it
already exists.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Make sure to modify the Nettrans.inf file at the installation source (typically
a flat folder), not the copy of Nettrans.inf file that is located in the
Windows\Inf folder. Any changes you make to the Nettrans.inf file in the
Windows\Inf folder are overwritten from the installation source folder.
