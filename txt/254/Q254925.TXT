======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you change the Printer.Orientation property, the Printer object does not
track the default printer again.

CAUSE
=====

The Printer.Orientation property call changes the Printer.TrackDefault property
to False so that the Printer object will not use the default orientation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem add the following line of code before the line to change
printer settings:

   Printer.TrackDefault = True

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Use the following steps to reproduce this behavior:

1. Install two printers onto your computer and name them Printer 1 and Printer
   2. Make Printer 1 the default printer.

2. Create a Standard EXE project with Microsoft Visual Basic 6. Form1 is created
   by default.

3. From the Project menu, select Components. In the Components dialog box,
   select the "Microsoft Common Dialog Control" check box and then click OK. The
   Common Dialog control's icon is added to the Toolbox.

4. Add a Common Dialog control to Form1.

5. Add a CommandButton named Command1 to Form1 and then insert the following
   code into the code window of Form1:

      Private Sub Command1_Click()
         Printer.Orientation = 2
         CommonDialog1.ShowPrinter
         Debug.Print Printer.DeviceName
      End Sub

6. Press F5 to run the project. Click Command1 and Printer 1 displays in the
   Printer dialog box as the current default printer. Choose Printer 2 from the
   drop down list, and then click OK to make Printer 2 the default Printer. You
   then see Printer 1 displayed in the immediate window instead of Printer 2.

7. Go back to design mode and add the following line of code:

   Printer.TrackDefault = True

Before this line:

   CommonDialog1.ShowPrinter

8. Press F5 to run the project again and now it works as expected.
