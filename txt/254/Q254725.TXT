TITLE   :XCON: (040) and (041) in DDA Addresses Cause NDRs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you send a message to an X.400 address similar to the following, you may
receive a non-delivery report (NDR):

 - C=FR;a=ATLAS;p=INTERNET;DDA:RFC-822=first(u)last@domain.com

 - C=FR;a=ATLAS;p=INTERNET;DDA:RFC-822=first_last(a)domain.com

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the Tracking.log file contains addresses similar to the
following:

 - C=FR;a=ATLAS;p=INTERNET;DDA:RFC-822=first(040)u(041)last@domain.com

 - C=FR;a=ATLAS;p=INTERNET;DDA:RFC-822=first(u)last(040)a(041)domain.com

The Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA) generates NDRs because of the
(040) and (041) in the address. The following characters,

 - a
 - b
 - p
 - q
 - u
 - r
 - l

are recognized as printable representations of non-printable character
substitutions when inside of parenthesis. For example, the (a) can be used to
represent the non-printable character @. The combination of the printable and
non-printable character representations creates an address that is difficult to
resolve.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, manually rewrite the address so that it does not
include both printable and non-printable characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 3. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server
5.5 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that messages sent to addresses similar to the following are handled
correctly:

 - C=FR;a=ATLAS;p=INTERNET;DDA:RFC-822=first_last@domain.com

 - C=FR;a=ATLAS;p=INTERNET;DDA:RFC-822=first(u)last(a)domain.com

Additional query words: unicode non-printable
