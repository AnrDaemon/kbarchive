======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the SelectionMode property of the GridCtrl control is set to
flexSelectionByRow, the row in the grid that is highlighted when the form that
contains the grid is first displayed remains highlighted when you select other
rows in the control.

STATUS
======

This problem was corrected in MSCEGrid.dll version 6.0.0.9313 for the Windows CE
Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0.

To obtain MSCEGrid.dll version 6.0.0.9313, see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Windows CE HPC Project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. On the Project menu, click Components, and add the Microsoft CE Grid Control
   6.0 library to the project.

3. Add a GridCtrl control to Form1.

4. Paste the following code into the code module of Form1:

   Option Explicit

   Private Sub Form_Load()
       ' Assign the dimensions of the grid control.
       GridCtrl1.Cols = 3
       GridCtrl1.Rows = 4
       ' Highlight the third row in the grid.
       GridCtrl1.Row = 2
       GridCtrl1.SelectionMode = flexSelectionByRow
   End Sub

5. Run the project in emulation or on a remote device. Notice that the third row
   in the grid is highlighted.

6. Select the first row in the grid. Notice that the third row stays highlighted
   even after you select another row.
