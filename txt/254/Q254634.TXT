TITLE   :PRB: Updating DAO Recordset from Excel Increases File Size
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::3.0,3.5,3.6,6.0

KEYWORDS:kbDAOsearch kbVBp600 kbGrpDSVBDB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - The DAO SDK, versions 3.0, 3.5, 3.6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a Data Access Object (DAO) recordset from an Excel spreadsheet and
update a record, the size of the Excel file increases dramatically when the
recordset is closed.

CAUSE
=====

Jet rewrites an alternate form for the data to each cell in the worksheet; in
cells that appear to contain data and those that do not. This alternate form
causes the file size to inflate.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use OLE Automation to open an instance of the workbook prior to opening the
recordset. If the workbook file is already open by using OLE Automation, DAO
builds the recordset using OLE Automation instead of using Jet. When the
recordset is updated and saved, the Excel file size is approximately the same as
before the recordset was opened.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open a new Visual Basic Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. On the Project menu, click to select References, and then select:

Microsoft DAO 3.6 Object Library

-and-

Microsoft Excel Object Library 9.0

3. Add a CommandButton control to Form, and set the following properties:

     Control                 Name                Caption/Text
  Command Button           cmdUpdate          Update DAO Recordset

4. Paste the following code into the General Declarations section of the form.
   If you don't have an existing Excel spreadsheet to use for a data source, you
   can create one by exporting a table from the NorthWind database using
   Microsoft Access. The Customers table was exported for this example.

   Dim db As DAO.Database
   Dim rs As DAO.Recordset
   Dim xlFileName As String

   Private Sub Form_Load()
       xlFileName = App.Path & "\Customers.xls"
       DisplayFileSize xlFileName, "Before DAO Update"
   '    Set xlObj = GetObject(xlFileName)  ' UnComment to retain file size
       Set db = OpenDatabase(xlFileName, _
                False, False, "Excel 8.0;")
       Set rs = db.OpenRecordset("Customers$")
       rs.MoveFirst

   End Sub

   Private Sub cmdUpdate_Click()
       rs.Edit
       rs.Fields("CompanyName").Value = "New Company"
       rs.Update
       rs.Close
       db.Close
       DisplayFileSize xlFileName, "After DAO Update"
       Unload Me
   End Sub

   Public Sub DisplayFileSize(sFile As String, sMessage As String)
       MsgBox sMessage & vbCrLf _
                & vbCrLf & "File Size is " & _
                Format(FileLen(sFile), "###,###,###."), _
                vbInformation, sFile
                
   End Sub

5. Run the project. A message box reports the size of the Excel file before any
   processing takes place. Click the Update DAO RecordsetCommandButton control.
   A message boxes reports the Excel file size after the update. Note that the
   file size increases dramatically.

6. Uncomment the code in the form_load that starts with "Set xlObj = . . ." and
   run the project again. Note that when you click CommandButton for Update DAO
   Recordset again, the file returns to its original size.
