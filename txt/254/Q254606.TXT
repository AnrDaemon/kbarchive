SUMMARY
=======

You may need to enable additional Microsoft Windows NT Performance Monitor
information store logging for troubleshooting purposes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To enable additional Performance Monitor information store logging, you need to
edit the registry:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the Library value under the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\Performance

3. On the Edit menu, click String, change the value from
   c:\exchsrvr\bin\mdbperf.dll to c:\exchsrvr\bin\mdbperfX.dll, and then click
   OK.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

After you modify this registry value, you must restart Performance Monitor to see
the new counters. The new counters are located under the MSExchangeIS object.
