SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to install and run Microsoft MapPoint 2001 over a
network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install and run MapPoint 2001 over a network:

1. Create an installation folder on the network server. The folder name must not
   include any spaces.

   For example, you could name the folder "MPInstall".

2. Insert the MapPoint 2001 Run CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive.

3. Copy the contents of the MapPoint 2001 Run CD-ROM to the folder that you
   created in step 1.

4. Insert the MapPoint 2001 Setup CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive. Press and hold
   down the SHIFT key as you insert the CD-ROM to prevent Setup from starting
   automatically.

5. Copy the contents of the MapPoint 2001 Setup CD-ROM to the folder that you
   created in step 1.

6. In the Confirm Folder Replace dialog box, click "Yes to All".

   NOTE: You cannot copy the contents of the MapPoint 2001 CD-ROM set to file
   servers that do not support long file names.

7. On the client computer, map a network drive to the folder on the server in
   which the MapPoint 2001 files are located.

   NOTE: MapPoint 2001 may not run correctly over some networks unless the folder
   from which MapPoint 2001 is to be run is mapped using a drive letter (as
   opposed to mapping the folder using a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path,
   such as "\\servername\foldername").

8. From the client computer, double-click the installation folder on the server.

9. Double-click Setup.exe.

10. Follow the instructions on the screen to install MapPoint 2001 on the client
   computer.

11. In the Microsoft MapPoint folder on the client computer, double-click
   Mappoint.exe.
