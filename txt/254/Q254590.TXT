TITLE   :Unattended Setup of NTOP Does Not Install SMTP Service
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Windows NT Option Pack (NTOP) for Windows NT Server
version 4.0 using the Unattended Setup mode, the SMTP Service is not installed.
This issue occurs even though the Unattend.txt file includes the IIS_SMTP = ON
entry in the SMTP and NNTP section.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs when Internet Information Server (IIS) 2.0 is installed during
the installation of Windows NT 4.0. Applying IIS 3.0 (included with Windows NT
Service Pack 3) does not resolve this problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem.

   12/02/98   11:22a 5.5.1877.24  615,696   Imsinsc.dll   (Alpha)
   12/03/98   10:00p               37,049   Ins.inf       (Alpha)



WORKAROUND
==========

When you install Windows NT Server 4.0, do not install Internet Information
Server. If you have done this already, run the Windows NT Option Pack Unattended
Setup a second time to install the SMTP Service.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server 4.0
.
