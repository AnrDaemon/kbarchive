TITLE   :XADM: Hidden Public Folders Shown in GAL of Other Site
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you open the global address list or the Recipients containers of other sites
in your organization, the public folder mailboxes of the other sites may be
displayed, even though the "Hide from the Address Book" option is selected for
the public folders.

You can remove the public folder mailboxes of the other site from the Recipients
containers and the global address list to lessen the probability of users
erroneously sending messages to the public folder mailbox, but to ensure that
these mailboxes are not displayed in other sites you need to select the "Hide
from the Address Book" option for intersite replication.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Be aware that if you select the "Hide from the Address Book" option for
intersite replication, users will not be able to post to these public folders by
using e-mail messages. To select the "Hide from Address Book" option so that
other sites cannot see the public folders in their Address Book:

1. Ensure that the properties for each public folder in question have the "Hide
   from Address Book" option selected:

   a. Select the properties of the public folder.

   b. Click the Advanced tab.

   c. Click to select the "Hide from Address Book" check box.

NOTE: Ensure that child-level public folders have the same setting. To save time,
propagate changes to those child folders:

   a. Select the top-level folder that you want to hide from the Address Book.

   b. Click the Advanced tab, and then click to select the "Hide from Address
      Book" check box.

   c. Click the General tab, and then click to select the "Propagate these
      properties to all subfolders" check box. A subfolder window is displayed;
      ensure that the "Hide from Address Book" check box is selected.

2. Ensure that the directory service site configuration attributes do not enable
   the "Hide from Address Book" option that you set in step 1:

   a. Open the properties of the directory service site Configuration container.

   b. Click the Attributes tab.

   c. In the Configure list, click Inter-site Replication.

   d. Scroll down to the "Hide from AB" check box, and then click to select it.

3. Make a change to each of the public folders that you want hidden, to ensure
   that an update is performed during the next replication cycle. You can do
   this by placing a remark in the Notes box in each folder. If you have
   multiple folders that require a replication update, you can make one change
   to the top-level folders, and then propagate that change to the subfolders.
