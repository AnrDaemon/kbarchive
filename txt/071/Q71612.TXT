SUMMARY
=======

This article contains information about using the RasterOps Colorboard 1024MC
color display system with Microsoft Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The RasterOps Colorboard 1024MC is a color display system that offers true
24-bit color display, which supports up to 16.7 million colors, VGA passthrough
for VGA application compatibility, and 3 MB of VRAM. It is compatible with the
IBM RISC 6000 and includes drivers for both Windows 3.0 and OS/2 Presentation
Manager. A driver for Windows 3.1 is available on the RasterOps BBS. The driver
is in ZIP format in the IBM PS/2 conference and is named 1024MC31.ZIP. Unzip the
file and replace your old driver of the same name.

The Colorboard 1024MC is designed for a 16-bit microchannel slot interface and
has a 1024 x 1024 24-bit frame buffer that allows you to view a high- resolution
(1024 x 768) true-color picture. VGA passthrough is achieved by using a "live
scan converter," allowing a VGA screen to be overlaid on top of the 1024 x 768
image.

A VGA display at a resolution of (640 x 480) can be overlaid on top of the
true-color image within a window. With a multifrequency monitor, the VGA image
can be displayed full screen, over the top of the 1024 x 768 image, or within a
smaller window. Without a multifrequency monitor, the VGA image can only be in a
window.
