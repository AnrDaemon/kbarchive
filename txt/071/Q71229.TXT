The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
 - Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The coordinates of Windows regions are in device units, not logical units.
Therefore, if the mapping mode is not MM_TEXT, region coordinates do not scale
as would be expected. This causes particular problems in metafiles because
metafiles often use MM_ISOTROPIC or MM_ANISOTROPIC modes to make pictures appear
the same on devices with different resolutions.

To work around this problem, applications should avoid using regions if the
mapping mode is changed from MM_TEXT. Regions should also be avoided in
metafiles, unless the application knows the scaling factor and can adjust region
coordinates itself.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the applications that will read and write the metafile are developed
together, the writing application can include an MFCOMMENT escape in the
metafile to store the region components. This information can be used by the
reading application to scale the metafile.
