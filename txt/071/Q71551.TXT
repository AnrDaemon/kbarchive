-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The changes you make in the Image Attributes dialog box of Paintbrush for
Windows 3.0 do not take effect until you:

1. Exit and restart Paintbrush.

2. Create a new Paintbrush file.

Under Windows 3.1, if you do not choose to start a new Paintbrush file after
changing settings, none of the changes you made are saved.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You cannot change certain image attributes of a picture while you are working on
that picture. Paintbrush reads parameters from the WIN.INI file on startup or
when you choose New from the File menu. When you change the Image Attributes in
Paintbrush, those changes are recorded in the [Paintbrush] section of the
WIN.INI. The [Paintbrush] section will not exist if you have never changed image
attributes. Parameters of the section are:

   width=x

   where x is the width of the image in pixels (Paintbrush terminology
   "pels")

   height=y

   where y is the height of the image in pixels (Paintbrush
   terminology "pels")

   clear=type

   where type is B/W or COLOR, determining the palette used.

Paintbrush does not remember changes to image attributes immediately; instead, it
reads the parameters from the WIN.INI file when you:

1. Start Paintbrush

2. Choose New from the File menu.

3. Change the settings in the Image Attributes dialog box. (Windows 3.1 only)

No other changes you make in the Options menu, including Brush Shape, Units, and
Palette, are saved to WIN.INI. Starting Paintbrush will always give you inches
under Unit, and the default palette and square brush shape.
