The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

When you open Paintbrush, you may have a monochrome palette and one of the
following error messages may be generated:

 - Insufficient memory to edit image; close one or more Windows applications to
   increase available memory and try again.

 - Insufficient disk space to edit image; delete one or more files from drive %s
   and try again.

Both of these errors may result on a system with ample free memory and disk space
if the standard drawing size is set to a very large area.

To check the standard drawing size, choose Image Attributes from the Paintbrush
Options menu.

If the standard drawing size is found to be substantially larger than the default
(6.67 inches x 5.00 inches), try using the default size.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A very large standard drawing size may require more disk space or free memory
than available, causing the appropriate error message. Paintbrush switches to a
monochrome palette in these situations to use less memory.
