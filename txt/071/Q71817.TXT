SYMPTOMS
========

If you run Microsoft Windows 3.0 with no screen fonts specified in the [FONTS]
section of your WIN.INI file and you choose the Fonts icon in the Control Panel
window, Windows generates the message:

   No Fonts Installed

If you choose OK in this dialog box, Windows the Add Font Files menu is
displayed. When you try to add fonts, the following inaccurate error message is
displayed:

   Font Already Installed

You are not allowed to add any fonts.

RESOLUTION
==========

To add fonts, you must first edit the [FONTS] section of your WIN.INI file to
contain at least one font (adding the Modern font is recommended because this
font is installed in every Windows installation).

Follow these steps:

1. Using any text editor, edit the [FONTS] section of WIN.INI by adding the
   following line:

   Modern (All res)=MODERN.FON

2. Exit the text editor, then use Control Panel to add fonts.

3. Restart (reboot) Windows to save your changes.
