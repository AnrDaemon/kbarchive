SUMMARY
=======

Grid Systems ships an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) version of Windows
version 3.0 with its laptop and portable computers. This version of Windows
installs a file called WIN.BAT into the MS-DOS subdirectory.

WIN.BAT determines how much power is available to the system and, according to
the amount available, starts Windows in real, standard, or enhanced mode. This
makes it appear that Windows is randomly deciding which mode to go into.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WIN.BAT prevents the system from going into a mode of Windows that it does not
have sufficient power to support. For example, running Windows in enhanced mode
when the system is low on power causes the system to stop responding (hang), and
possibly lose data.


The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these product's performance
or reliability.
