======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you execute _DEFAULT.PIF from File Manager, the following error message is
displayed:

   Cannot find file, _default.bat

CAUSE
=====

This is by design.

_DEFAULT.PIF should not be manually executed from anywhere inside Windows. The
_DEFAULT.PIF file is used automatically for MS-DOS applications that do not have
a PIF. If changes are made to _DEFAULT.PIF, they are used when MS-DOS
applications without PIFs are started under Windows.

NOTE: The file referenced in the error message, _DEFAULT.BAT, does not really
exist. It is a dummy variable used as a placeholder to allow _DEFAULT.PIF to be
saved (see page 449 in the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide").

MORE INFORMATION
================

Please refer to page 448 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for more
information on PIFs.
