-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you use Masterpiece Studio Management Software by Burrell Business Systems
with Microsoft Windows version 3.0 in 386 enhanced mode, you must add the
following statement to the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file:

   UniqueDOSPSP=true

If enabled, this statement tells Windows to start every application at a unique
address (PSP).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Each time Windows creates a new virtual machine to start a new application,
Windows reserves a unique amount of memory (i bytes) below the application. For
example, the first application is loaded at address M, the second at address
M+i, the third at M+2i, etc. The amount of memory (i) is determined by the
PSPIncrement setting. This setting helps assure that applications in different
virtual machines all start at different addresses.

Some networks use applications' load addresses to identify the different
processes using the network. On such networks, failing to enable this setting
might cause one application to fail when you exit another because the network
interprets them as the same. However, enabling this setting will leave slightly
less memory for non-Windows applications. If you are running a network based on
Microsoft Network or LAN Manager, the default value is TRUE. See the
NETWORKS.TXT online document to find out whether the network you are running is
one of these.
