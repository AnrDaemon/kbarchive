The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Learning Company's earlier Reader and Writer Rabbit software applications
may lock a computer system with ANSI.SYS loaded high using MS-DOS version 5.0.
This problem occurs when either program is executed from the hard disk and the
program requests the key disk be inserted into the floppy drive. When this is
done, the system may lock up.

The problem might be caused by a copy protection scheme that both these programs
have. Reader 2.4 and Writer 1.2 are specific versions that contain a copy
protection scheme and have locked systems.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Load ANSI.SYS low.

-or-

2. Upgrade to a later version of either program. Reader version 4.1 and Writer
   version 1.3 no longer have a copy protection scheme and do not produce the
   same problem as the earlier versions.
