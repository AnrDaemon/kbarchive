The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Device Development Kit (DDK) for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

SetKBD.exe is a sample that dynamically loads a new keyboard dynamic-link
library (DLL) by altering the "keyboard.dll=" setting in the "[keyboard]"
section of the System.ini configuration file. By calling the NewTable function
in the keyboard driver, SetKBD.exe loads the new keyboard DLL and sets the
keyboard driver to reflect this new DLL. SetKBD.exe also obtains and displays
the current settings of the physical keyboard type and subtype, but does not
change them. SetKBD.exe obtains these values by calling the GetKeyboardType
function.

The Readme.txt file in the \Keyboard directory of the Microsoft Windows Device
Development Kit (DDK) version 3.0 refers to the SetKBD.exe application. However,
this application is not included in the DDK distribution. This application is
available for download from the Microsoft Download Center.

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

The specification of SetKBD.exe differs from that in the Readme.txt file of the
DDK because SetKBD.exe does not change the settings of the physical keyboard. On
many systems, changing the physical keyboard settings (without actually changing
the physical keyboard) might hang the system. If it is necessary to physically
change keyboards, the Windows Setup program handles this sufficiently.
