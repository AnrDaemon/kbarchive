======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

The PCNAU StarLan Card currently does not work with Microsoft LAN Manager
version 2.0. AT&T states that the driver (ATTCSMA.DOS) for this card is not
2.0-compliant, and they plan to release a version 2.0 NDIS compatible driver in
the version 3.5 release of AT&T StarLan.

In addition, the AT&T driver is specific to the PC NAU StarLan Card from
AT&T. Therefore, if you try to install the AT&T Stack (ATTISO.DOS) with
NetBEUI dual stack on a card that is certified to work with LAN Manager, the
driver will give a "Network card not found" error when executing NETBIND.
