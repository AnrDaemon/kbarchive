======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

The Minesweeper game packaged with the Windows Entertainment Pack (WEP1) won't
save high scores if you have set a custom grid with which to play, or if you
have selected Expert level from the Game menu.

Solution
--------

From the Games Menu, change the color, size, or marks options to save your high
scores with a custom grid, or with Expert level selected. This rewrites the
Minesweeper section of the ENTPACK.INI and saves the recorded high scores.
