-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Windows Setup program does not see an earlier version of Windows
if the file WINVER.EXE is not in the Windows directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Setup checks the hard drive for another copy of Windows by looking for
WINVER.EXE. If this file has been deleted or is not in the Windows directory,
Setup attempts to install a new copy of Windows.

This is by design.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.00a 3.10 3.11 installed current win31
