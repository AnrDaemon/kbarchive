The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If the ALDUS subdirectory does not appear in the path when you install Aldus
PageMaker version 4.0, PageMaker does not run. If you attempt to run PageMaker
without the ALDUS subdirectory in the path, the following error messages occur:

 - Cannot find file ALDFS.DLL

 - Cannot find file ALDVM.DLL

 - Cannot find file ALDIM.DLL

 - Cannot find file ALDPLS.DLL

MORE INFORMATION
================

The installation of PageMaker 4.0 creates two subdirectories by default: ALDUS
and PM4. If the Setup program is not allowed to make changes to the AUTOEXEC.BAT
file, neither subdirectory appears in the path, causing the error messages. It
is necessary to allow Setup to make these changes, or to manually add the ALDUS
directory to the path statement following installation.
