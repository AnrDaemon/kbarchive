SUMMARY
=======

In File Manager, it may not be possible to view some documents with document
file icons.

The four types of file icons are:

 - Directories

 - Program files

 - Document files

 - All other files

MORE INFORMATION
================

File Manager determines a file's icon based upon the three-letter extension of
the filename, and whether this extension is listed on the "program=" line or in
the [extensions] section of the WIN.INI file. Therefore, a file need not be a
text file to have a document file icon.

Examples of some non-text files with document file icons are:

 - TETRIS.INI, which goes with the Microsoft Entertainment Pack.

 - MW.INI, which goes with Microsoft Word for MS-DOS.

CONFIG.SYS, which is a text file, does not have a document file icon.
