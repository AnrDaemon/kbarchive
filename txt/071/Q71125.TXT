-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Search Entire Disk option in File Manager's Search dialog box causes File
Manager to search the entire partition, not the entire disk. For example, if you
want to search partitions C, D, and E, you need to perform a separate search for
each partition.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On page 124 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide," step 4 states that after
you select the Search Entire Disk check box, "File Manager will search the
entire disk drive." This is incorrect.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.0 3.0a 3.00a docerr
