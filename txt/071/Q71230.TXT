SUMMARY
=======

If speed is the most critical factor when an application writes text to a
window, then the application should take advantage of every possible speed
improvement no matter how minor. Therefore, when writing text to a window in a
time-constrained environment, ExtTextOut() should be used instead of TextOut()
because ExtTextOut() is slightly faster.

ExtTextOut() is the lowest level function that an application can call to output
text to a window. On the other hand, TextOut() is essentially a call to
ExtTextOut() with wOptions, lpRect, and lpDx set to zero. Using ExtTextOut() may
not result in a noticeable speed difference; however, it is the faster
alternative especially when the application has a large amount of text to write.
