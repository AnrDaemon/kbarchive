SUMMARY
=======

The Epson LQ-500, 850, 1050, and 2500 have internal font capability to print
extended ANSI characters (character values 128 through 255), but their extended
character values are not the same as the Windows 3.0 internal fonts character
values.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example:

Using the Epson's Roman 10 cpi font and pressing ALT+0248 from Windows shows
Windows ANSI 248 on the screen but prints as ANSI 111.

Using the Windows font TMS RMN 10 point and pressing ALT+0248 from Windows shows
Windows ANSI 248 on the screen and prints the same.

There are two possible solutions to this problem:

 - Use Windows' fonts instead of internal printer fonts when you need these
   characters.

 - Instead of using Windows' extended ANSI characters, use the OEM character set
   built into the printer, as follows:

   a. In the printer's manual, look up the extended ANSI code for the character
      desired.

   b. Instead of pressing the Windows code (for example, ALT+0248), press the
      printer OEM code (for example, ALT+216). The character displayed may or
      may not look correct on the screen, but it will print correctly.

The Epson products included here are manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
