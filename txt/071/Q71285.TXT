SUMMARY
=======

Sometimes it is mistakenly assumed that when the C strtok() function inserts a
null character ('\0') into the source string at the end of a token, the length
of the source string increases by this new character. This is not the case
because an additional character is not actually being inserted. Instead, the
delimiter that strtok() found to indicate the end of the token is replaced by
the null character.

Thus, when declaring or allocating the string of tokens, you do not need to make
allowances for the null characters to be inserted.
