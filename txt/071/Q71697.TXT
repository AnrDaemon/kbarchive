SUMMARY
=======

The Operator program (OPERATOR.EXE) looks in the GLB directory of the Microsoft
Mail database for a text file named OPERATOR.GLB. The OPERATOR.GLB file contains
a list of action items you will be able to choose from the Action field in
Operator.

Action items should be separated by hard carriage returns.

For example, create a text file with the following information:

   Telephoned
   Returned your call
   Please call
   Will call again
   Wants to see you
   Left package

The list of action items will be sorted when it is viewed from within the
Operator program. This feature is not explained in the Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks documentation.
