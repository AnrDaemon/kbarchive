-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

Many third-party programs that are used to check Microsoft Word for Windows
files (such as Grammatik) do not work correctly if the file is saved with a fast
save, rather than a normal save. A fast save appends changes to a document at
the end of a file, rather than rearranging the entire file to insert all changes
every time you save the file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To turn off the Fast Saves feature in Word 97 for Windows, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. In the Options dialog box, click the Save tab.

3. Click to clear the Allow fast saves check box.

For additional information about the Fast Saves option, please see the following
