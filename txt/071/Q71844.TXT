The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a

SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Windows version 3.0, the scroll bars do not update correctly in
Program Manager groups if either of the following conditions exist:

 - The scroll bars were not already present.

 - Auto Arrange on the Option menu in Program Manager is not checked.

Vertical and horizontal scroll bars display in Program Manager group windows when
any icon contained within a group is not fully visible. If an icon is selected
and dragged out of view so that it appears clipped by the group window border,
the vertical and/or horizontal scroll bar that should appear do not.

This problem does not occur in later versions of Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To display the scroll bars in Windows version 3.0, do one of the following:

 - Minimize and then restore the group window.

   -or-

 - Move a different icon within the group window.

Workaround
----------

From the Options menu in Program Manager, choose Auto Arrange. The truncated icon
"snaps back" into the next available icon position.
