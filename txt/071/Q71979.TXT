-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When NMAKE is run on the makefile SNAP.MAK included with the sample programs in
the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.00, the following errors are
generated:

   NMAKE : fatal error U1073: don't know how to make 'COMMON.ASM'

   NMAKE : fatal error U1073: don't know how to make 'demo.inc'

The errors occur because the makefile does not contain the correct directory
specification for the files COMMON.ASM and DEMO.INC.

To work around the U1073 errors, copy the files COMMON.ASM and DEMO.INC from the
\SAMPLES\DEMOS subdirectory to the \SAMPLES\TSR subdirectory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, SNAP.MAK is installed in a subdirectory under MASM 6.00 called
\SAMPLES\TSR. SNAP.MAK should assemble the files SNAP.ASM, INSTALL.ASM,
COMMON.ASM, and HANDLERS.ASM. The makefile assumes that the files DEMO.INC and
COMMON.ASM are in the current directory with the other .ASM files. The U1073
errors are generated because the MASM 6.00 installation program actually places
COMMON.ASM and DEMO.INC in the \SAMPLES\DEMOS subdirectory, and NMAKE cannot
find them.

Additional query words: 6.00 6.00a 6.00b
