The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you run the Windows Setup program, from the Main Group under Program Manager,
it does not display the correct swap file setting if the line

   paging=off

is added to the SYSTEM.INI file's [386Enh] section.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is possible to have either a permanent or temporary swap file reported by
Windows Setup, but not have Windows use it. In enhanced mode, the line "Swap
file:" in the Windows Setup window has only two display settings:

   Temporary

   - or -

   Permanent

In real and standard modes, if a temporary swap file is being used, Windows Setup
shows "Swap file: None."

In 386 enhanced mode, the line "paging=off" is added to the SYSTEM.INI file's
[386Enh] section to stop Windows from paging applications to the virtualized
memory on the hard disk. When this line is invoked, the Windows Setup program is
unaware of its existence.

For more information on the "paging=off" setting, please refer to the SYSINI3.TXT
file in your Windows directory.
