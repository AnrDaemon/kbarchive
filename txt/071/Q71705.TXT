SUMMARY
=======

When loading Microsoft MS-DOS into high memory, DOS=HIGH and DEVICE statements
for the XMS driver do not have to be the first two entries in the CONFIG.SYS
file.

This information applies to MS-DOS version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DOS=HIGH statement can appear on any line in the CONFIG.SYS file. After
finding the DOS=HIGH statement, MS-DOS loads each device driver starting at the
beginning of the CONFIG.SYS file. When the XMS driver is loaded, MS-DOS
relocates into high memory. Because the device drivers are loaded in the order
they appear in the file, any device driver that needs XMS memory should appear
after the XMS driver.

Only DEVICEHIGH statements in the CONFIG.SYS file that appear after the XMS
driver and the UMB provider will be loaded into the upper memory area (UMA).
When using MS-DOS 5.0 memory management, this means DEVICEHIGH statements must
appear after the HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE drivers.
