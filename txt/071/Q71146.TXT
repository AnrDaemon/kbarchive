TITLE   :PRB: SDK Sample Applications Use Incorrect Background Brush
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Many of the sample applications that come with the Windows Software Development
Kit (SDK) use a stock object white brush for the window background color. When
the system background color is changed through the Control Panel, the
backgrounds of these sample applications do not change along with the other
applications.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, change the value of the hbrBackground field in the
WNDCLASS structure from GetStockObject(WHITE_BRUSH) to COLOR_WINDOW+1. The
background of each modified sample will change with that of every other
Windows-based application.
