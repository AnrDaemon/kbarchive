SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the following two known printing problems with Delrina
Technology's PerForm Pro and Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet printers:

 - Paper Source Cannot be Changed to Manual

 - PerForm Error Message when Printing: "EC Feed Monarc"

MORE INFORMATION
================

PerForm Pro for Windows is a form-processing software product that allows you to
design, fill in, print, and manage business forms.

Cannot Change Paper Source to Manual
------------------------------------

When you print to any HP LaserJet printer from PerForm Pro by Delrina Technology,
the paper source cannot be changed to manual or envelope feed from within
PerForm Pro. Choosing manual or envelope feed from within PerForm Pro resets the
paper source to auto select or upper tray, depending on the kind of HP LaserJet
printer.

To change the paper source for an HP LaserJet printer driver:

1. Run Control Panel and choose the Printers icon.

2. Choose the Configure button.

3. Choose the Setup button.

4. Enter the desired setup information.

Do not use the File Select or File Print Setup options in PerForm Pro.

Technology.

PerForm Error Message "EC Feed Monarc"
--------------------------------------

When you print from Delrina Technology's PerForm Pro to any HP PCL5 printer using
legal-sized paper, the printer may display the following error message because
PerForm Pro does not correctly handle legal-sized paper:

   EC Feed Monarc

To work around this problem, press the Continue button on the control panel of
the printer. Pressing the Continue button will allow the print job to continue
without any adverse effects.

The printer drivers that are affected by this problem are versions 3.7 and 3.77
of the HPPCL5A.DRV driver.

Delrina is researching this problem. For more information, contact Delrina
