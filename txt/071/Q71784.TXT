SUMMARY
=======

When you install Stacker by STAC Electronics, any empty directories on your hard
drive are not recreated on the new Stacker partition. If empty, the TEMP
directory is not created and Microsoft Windows will have memory and printing
problems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Stacker uses a memory resident compression algorithm to expand and compress data
in a real time manner. During the installation of Stacker, existing data is
compressed as needed and moved to free hard drive space. This newly compressed
data is only usable when the Stacker driver is loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file.

The product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance
or reliability.
