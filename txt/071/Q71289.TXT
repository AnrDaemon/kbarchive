The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Two XGA Video Adapters can be used in one Micro Channel machine. However, the
Microsoft Windows version 3.0 XGA driver that IBM supplies disables one of the
cards.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use two XGA cards, each must be connected to a different type of monitor (for
example, a standard VGA monitor on one card and a super VGA monitor on the
other). Windows uses the monitor that corresponds to the driver installed during
setup. Your entire session, including Windows and MS-DOS applications that you
run under Windows, are limited to that one monitor.

If you run applications under native MS-DOS, you can use either monitor,
depending upon the MS-DOS application's resolution.
