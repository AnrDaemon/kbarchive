SYMPTOMS
========

ALR 386 Microchannel (MPS) computers with Seagate IDE drives cannot run Windows
in enhanced mode. If you run enhanced mode Windows on an ALR 386 Microchannel
(MPS) computer with a Seagate IDE hard drive, the following error message is
displayed repeatedly:

   Device driver specified <x> is invalid or corrupt

where <x> is a virtual driver used by Windows to run in enhanced mode.

Windows also may not run consistently in standard or real modes on ALR
Microchannel machines with Seagate IDE hard drives. The following error message
may appear when you try to run any application, even if the system has
sufficient free memory and hard disk space:

   Insufficient Memory to Run Application

CAUSE
=====

ALR and Seagate report there is an incompatibility between the ALR BIOS and
Seagate IDE drives. They are currently working on a solution.

NOTE: ALR does not install Seagate drives in its Microchannel machines, and
reports no problems when using factory installed Western Digital and Toshiba
hard drives.

WORKAROUND
==========

Replace the Seagate IDE hard drive with a Western Digital or Toshiba IDE hard
drive. ALR also reports compatibility with Quantum and Maxtor IDE drives.
