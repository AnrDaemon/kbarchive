SUMMARY
=======

If you are experiencing problems setting up the Windows Entertainment Pack 1
(WEP 1), check the following:

1. Boot the system clean (boot with your DOS system floppy disk). The WEP does
   not require Windows to be in protected mode (standard or enhanced). As a
   result, by simply booting with a DOS floppy disk, you will eliminate any TSR
   or memory-resident utilities that load on boot.

2. Check for available disk space. The WEP requires 70K of hard disk space to
   load. Also, the WEP copies two files, WINBINXZ.EXE and WEPSETUP.INF to the
   WINDOWS directory to run the Setup program. These files are deleted after
   Setup is completed, but the Windows directory needs enough disk space to hold
   these two files.

3. If all else fails, decompress the WEP files using the Expand utility
   (EXPAND.EXE) found on Disk 2 of your Windows 3.00 disks, onto your hard drive
   and build your own program group and icons.
