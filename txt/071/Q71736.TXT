SUMMARY
=======

The background bitmap files PARTY.BMP and RIBBONS.BMP are not included on the
Microsoft Windows version 3.0a disks. This is due to space constraints, and the
nonessential nature of the files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some third-party drivers require the replacement of the SETUP.INF file to
install correctly. Third-party SETUP.INF files, developed for Windows version
3.0, may not reflect this change, and may therefore ask for these two bitmap
files.

Workaround
----------

Create a new disk and copy two of the existing files to the blank disk with the
names PARTY.BMP and RIBBONS.BMP. For example, you would copy WEAVE.BMP from disk
3 (5.25 inch) or disk 5 (3.5 inch) to PARTY.BMP on the blank disk. You also
would copy the file to the name RIBBONS.BMP on the blank disk.

This procedure will fool Setup, and allow you to continue installation.
