The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You are using the Microsoft Windows 3.0 PCL/HP driver version 3.3 or 3.4 and
when you change the default Paper Source field through Control Panel, your
changes aren't saved when you exit and restart Windows.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows 3.0 PCL/HP driver does not allow the default Paper Source field to
be changed and saved through Control Panel and Printers if the paper source is
set to either Manual Feed or Envelope. If either of these are set, the Paper
Source reverts back to upper tray the next time Windows is started.

WORKAROUND
==========

Set the default Paper Source field manually through the WIN.INI file:

1. Load the WIN.INI file into a text editor such as Notepad.

2. Locate the section [HPPCL,LPTx] or [HPPCL,COMx], and add a new line to this
   section

   Tray=x

    where x = 1 for Default paper tray ("top tray")
              2 for Lower paper tray
              3 for Manual feed
              7 for Auto paper feed

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
