PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the resource compiler processes a resource script, the following message is
displayed:

   RW1022: I/O error writing file.

CAUSE
=====

The resource compiler creates a temporary file in the directory specified by the
TMP MS-DOS environment variable. There may not be enough room in the temporary
directory to extend this file.

NOTE: This is just one possible cause for the error message; there are others.
The Build Tools help file that comes with Visual C++ discusses some of them.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make room on the device that holds the temporary files.
