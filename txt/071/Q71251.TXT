If you load a read-only .CAL data file into Calendar and then select the
File Menu Save As command, an error message similar to the following is
displayed.

   Cannot Save File;
   Check to ensure the path and filename are correct and, if applicable, the
   network is running.

To save the file, you must remove the file's read-only attribute. You can
do this with the MS-DOS Attrib command, as follows:

   attrib -r <filename>.cal

where <filename.cal> is the name of the read-only .CAL data file.
