The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may encounter a

   path not found

or

   file not found

error message if you use the MS-DOS Prompt utility in Microsoft Windows 3.0 to
try to type a filename or copy a file on a network drive.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused by using XMSNETx.EXE version 3.01 revision A.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, obtain the 3.02 version of the workstation update,
create a new IPX.COM, and use the 3.02 version of XMSNETx.EXE.

To find out what revision of the shell is running, type

   NVER

after logging on to the network; or on the boot disk, go to the directory where
the XMSNETx.EXE is located and type

   XMSNETx i

where x is 3 or 4, depending on what version of MS-DOS is being used.

Temporary Workaround
--------------------

Replace the XMSNETx.EXE with NETx.COM (version 3.01) until the upgraded
components can be obtained.
