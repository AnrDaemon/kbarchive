SUMMARY
=======

In the Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit (SDK) for HyperCard, the
following function removes the enclosure, specified by the value of "index",
from the message in "messageRef":

      msmail(removeEnclosure, messageRef, index)

If index has a value of negative one (-1), all enclosures are removed.

This call should be used only for messages that have not yet been sent. Removing
an enclosure from a sent message will not remove the enclosure from the server.

For example, to forward a message, but not the enclosures, use the following
commands:

      put msmail (getMessage, messageType, messageID) into messageRef
      put msmail (createForward, messageRef) into forwardMessage
      get msmail (removeEnclosure, forwardMessage, -1)

This information is taken from the "Microsoft Mail HyperCard Interface
Documentation."
