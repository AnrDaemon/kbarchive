SUMMARY
=======

MS-DOS allows you to append several binary files together using the COPY
command. However, the target file that results is smaller than the sum of the
source files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To append binary files, use the COPY command with the /b switch. The syntax is
as follows:

   copy <source1> /b + <source2> /b [....] <targetfile>

   -or-

   copy /b <source1> + <source2> [....] <targetfile>

You can also combine several files into one by using wildcards. For example:

   copy /b *.exe combin.exe

Note: The /b switch is also useful when combining or appending ASCII files that
contain embedded control characters.

For more information, query on the following words:

   " COPY and strip and EOF
   COPY and concatenate
   COPY and XCOPY and merge " (without the quotation marks)
