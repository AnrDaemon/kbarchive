SUMMARY
=======

If you are in an MS-DOS window while running Windows 3.0 in enhanced mode and
you attempt to change or check the network configuration of a user, your system
may stop responding (hang) or the following error may appear:

   UNRECOVERABLE APPLICATION ERROR TERMINATING CURRENT APPLICATION

MORE INFORMATION
================

When creating a new Novell workstation installation of Windows 3.0 or checking
an existing one, the Windows Setup program (SETUP.EXE) should be executed in one
of the following two ways:

1. If you are on a workstation and attempting to configure a new installation of
   Windows, always run the Windows Setup program by typing "setup" (without the
   quotation marks) or "setup /n" (without the quotation marks) at the normal
   DOS system prompt.

   -or-

2. If a current network installation of Windows 3.00 is being checked or
   modified, run the Setup program by double clicking the Setup icon located in
   the Main Group of the Program Manager.

Exercising one of the two Windows installation methods above will ensure that the
system does not hang and that this error does not occur. For more information on
installing Windows on a network, please refer to pages 553-554 of the "Microsoft
Windows User's Guide" for version 3.00.
