SUMMARY
=======

Dialog boxes in Windows version 3.0 and later suppport menus as long as the
DS_MODALFRAME style is absent and the WS_SYSMENU style is present. This behavior
will continue to be supported in future versions of Windows.

Dialogs with a modal frame and menu do not work and are not designed to do so.
