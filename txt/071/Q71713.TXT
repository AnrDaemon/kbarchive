The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Both MS-DOS version 5.0 Shell and Windows provide task switching. Having two
task switchers simultaneously in memory may cause a conflict; therefore, when
using Shell and Windows together, do not enable the Shell task switcher.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MS-DOS versions 4.x Shell does not provide task switch capabilities, so there is
no problem using those Shell versions with Windows.
