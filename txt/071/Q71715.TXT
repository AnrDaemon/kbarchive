The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to change the volume label with the LABEL command, it remains
the same.

CAUSE
=====

The volume label is stored in a directory entry in the root directory. A root
directory entry that has the volume label attribute set is regarded as the
volume label by MS-DOS. If the volume label entry is in lowercase, MS- DOS will
be unable to modify it.

MS-DOS will never write a lowercase volume label to a disk. However, it is
possible that a third-party program could write a lowercase volume label.

When MS-DOS displays the volume label, such as in a DIR or LABEL command, it
converts it to uppercase. This means that the volume label may appear in
uppercase when MS-DOS displays it, but in actuality it could be lowercase.

MS-DOS is unable to correct this problem. A third-party disk editor must be used
to change the volume label to uppercase. Only a person familiar with MS-DOS
directory structures should attempt to modify the root directory.

The only other alternative to using a disk editor to correct this problem is to
reformat the drive. Formatting will erases all the information stored on the
drive including the volume label.
