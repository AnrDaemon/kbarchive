TITLE   :PC Tools 6.0 REBUILD.COM Incompatible with MS-DOS 5.0 and Later
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.x,6.0,6.2,6.21,6.22

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The PC Tools version 6.0 REBUILD.COM command checks the current DOS version
before it continues, and returns the following error message:

   Wrong DOS

CAUSE
=====

This is problem occurs because MS-DOS version 5.0 and later are unknown version
numbers to PC TOOLS version 6.0; when it attempts to confirm the DOS version,
REBUILD.COM is unable to continue.

WORKAROUND
==========

This error message is embedded in REBUILD.COM. The only workaround for this
problem is to use the MS-DOS 5.0 or later UNFORMAT command. UNFORMAT performs
the same function as REBUILD.

NOTE: Using the MS-DOS 5.0 or later SETVER command does not correct this problem.

Additional query words: 6.22 5.00 5.00a 6.00 6.20
