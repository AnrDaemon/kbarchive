-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0b, 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks server that is also a master
gateway server has not seen one of its gateway access servers on the network for
a period of time longer than its Return Undeliverable Mail setting (in the
Server Settings dialog box), the Mail master gateway server will expire (or
"forget" about) that gateway access server.

When this happens, the master gateway server purges the users from the forgotten
server in its own global user list. In addition, it forgets that this server is
a gateway access server. If this expired (forgotten) server is brought back up
on the network, the master gateway server will read in the forgotten server's
user list and will exchange user lists with the expired server again, but the
master gateway server will not remember that this server was a gateway access
server.

The server that used to be the gateway access server will not receive any
notification that it is no longer a gateway access server. However, you may see
any or all of the following symptoms of this problem:

 - Gateway recipients that are defined on the master gateway server will not be
   forwarded.

-or-

 - Changes made to gateway recipients on the master gateway server will not be
   forwarded.

RESOLUTION
==========

To restore the access server to working order, the access gateway resources on
the access server must be removed and then reinstalled.

To Remove an Access Gateway
---------------------------

1. Sign in to the access server as the Network Manager.

2. Launch the Gateway Installer and select the appropriate gateway.

3. From the Access menu, choose Remove Access Gateway. The Gateway Installer
   will ask if you are sure you want to remove the selected access gateway.
   Click Yes.

To Install an Access Gateway
----------------------------

1. Sign in to the access server as the Network Manager.

2. Launch the Gateway Installer.

3. From the Access menu, choose Install Access Gateway. The Gateway Installer
   will ask you to select an access gateway to install. Locate the access
   gateway file and click Install.

To help prevent master gateway servers from expiring access gateway servers, the
Return Undeliverable Mail setting should be set to an amount of time longer than
any anticipated breaks in communication.
