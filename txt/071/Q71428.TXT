======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run Microsoft Windows 3.0 on a Microsoft LAN Manager 2.0 Enhanced (or
100-percent compatible) network, it is possible to receive pop-up messages in
the WinPopup display panel. However, if you run Windows in real or standard mode
and close WinPopup, Windows stops responding (hangs) and the screen becomes
corrupted if a network pop-up message is received.

NOTE: This does not occur if you run Windows in 386 enhanced mode.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because NetPopup (the network message handler) attempted to
display the message without being able to queue the message through WinPopup
(the Windows message handler).

WORKAROUND
==========

Reboot the computer and restart Windows, but do not close WinPopup if you are
running in real or standard mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you attempt to create a permanent swapfile by running Windows in real mode
and closing WinPopup, your system will hang if a pop-up message is received by
the workstation. To avoid problems during the rare times you are creating or
modifying a permanent swapfile, do not start the network.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows version 3.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.
