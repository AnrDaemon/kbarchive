SUMMARY
=======

The MERGEREC field can be used to automatically number the records in a
Microsoft Word print merge document.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the MERGEREC field in the main document of a mail merge in Word to
automatically indicate which record is being merged. This field is updated
during the mail merge and inserts the number of the current record into the
merged document.

To use the MERGEREC field:

1. Press CTRL+F9 to insert field braces ({}) in the main document where the
   merged record number is to be placed.

2. Type the word MERGEREC. (This is not case sensitive.)

3. Perform the mail merge as usual.

NOTE: If you are merging multiple records into a table (for example, to print
labels) you should place a MERGEREC field in each cell of the table following
the NEXT or NEXTIF field. The NEXT or NEXTIF field will increment the result of
the MERGEREC field and number each record in the table.
