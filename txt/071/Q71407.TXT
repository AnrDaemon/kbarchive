SUMMARY
=======

In the Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit (SDK) for HyperCard, the
following function changes the server that login calls will be made to:

      msmail (chooseServer, serverName [, zone])

This call simulates the effects of using the Chooser desk accessory (DA) to point
the local Microsoft Mail workstation to a server. The name of the server must be
supplied. Specifying the AppleTalk zone is optional. If the zone parameter is
omitted, the current zone will be used. This does not affect the auto-login
preferences for the user in any way and does NOT return any indication if the
newly chosen server actually exists.

Using chooseServer to select a new server will break all existing Mail sessions
from the current machine, including DA sessions. This is the only way to logoff
the client session.

Note: If you don't have zones and you want to specify a zone name, use an
asterisk (*).

For example:

      get msmail(ChooseServer, "Server #1234","*")

The above line selects a server named "Server #1234". The current zone will be
used since no argument is passed for the zone parameter.

      get msmail(ChooseServer, "Accounting", "FourthFloor")

The above line will logoff the current client (DA) session, even if it is logged
into the "Accounting" server in the "FourthFloor" zone.

This information is taken from the "Microsoft Mail HyperCard Interface
Documentation."
