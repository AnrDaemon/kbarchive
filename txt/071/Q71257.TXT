SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Mail, if a server is running under low memory conditions, deleting
messages may not work properly.

Normally, the number of messages in the Mailbox folder is reduced by the number
of messages deleted and these messages are moved to the Wastebasket folder.

However, under low memory conditions, if the number of messages in the
Wastebasket folder updates, and the Wastebasket folder contains the deleted
messages, the Mailbox folder still retains the original number of messages.

This problem occurs only with the Mailbox folder, and the messages will not be
deleted until the Current Server Memory Allocation option is increased in the
Server Settings dialog box (on the Mail menu).
