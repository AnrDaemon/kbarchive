The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22

SUMMARY
=======

To print a file from the MS-DOS Shell File System, the background printing
utility, PRINT.COM, must be installed. The following is the procedure to install
PRINT.COM from MS-DOS Shell:

1. If using MS-DOS version 5.0 or later, verify that Task Swapping is not
   enabled in the Options menu. If it is enabled, disable it.

2. From MS-DOS Shell, press SHIFT+F9.

3. Execute the PRINT.COM command by typing the following command at the command
   prompt:

   " print /d:<device>" (without the quotation marks)

   The default device is PRN. Other possible print device names for parallel
   ports are LPT1, LPT2, and LPT3. Serial device names are COM1, COM2, COM3, and
   COM4. (LPT1 and PRN both refer to the first parallel port on your computer.)

4. Type "exit" (without the quotation marks) to return to Shell.

5. Select the file or files that you would like to print.

6. From the File menu, choose Print.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The PRINT.COM (PRINT.EXE in version 5.0 or later) command can also be executed
from the command line or placed in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Type the following
command at the MS-DOS command prompt or use a text editor to add the line to
your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   " print /d:<device>" (without the quotation marks)
