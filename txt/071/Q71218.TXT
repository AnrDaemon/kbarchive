TITLE   :Idlewild Shows Blackness as Only Option

SUMMARY
=======

When loading the Idlewild screen saver program from the "load=" line in the
WIN.INI file, the only screen blanking option available is Blackness, when
windows is running under a shell other than Program Manager, such as File
Manager, MS-DOS Executive, or HDC Windows Express).

To correct this problem, do only one of the following:

 - Using Notepad or SysEdit, edit the "shell=" line in the SYSTEM.INI file to
   read "shell=progman.exe".

   -or-

 - If using a shell other than Program Manager is desired, the Win command must
   be executed from within the directory containing the Microsoft Entertainment
   Pack for Windows (C:\WEP by default). For example; enter "cd\wep" at the DOS
   prompt and then enter "win" (without the quotation marks) to start Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For Idlewild to show the options for screen blanking, it must access the screen
blanking files (files with the extension ".IW"). When the "shell=" line in
SYSTEM.INI declares a shell other than PROGMAN.EXE, Idlewild will be unable to
access the .IW files unless the Win command is executed from within that
directory.
