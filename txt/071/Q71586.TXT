SUMMARY
=======

To maintain a fixed disk, you may wish to run CHKDSK /F as a child process from
an application that runs continuously. However, you should not do this.

CHKDSK assumes that the file allocation table (FAT) is in a stable state. If
CHKDSK detects an error and attempts to correct it by making changes to the FAT,
CHKDSK could destroy the FAT operations that MS-DOS has done up to that point.

More specifically, if CHKDSK is run when a file is open, the chain of clusters
"owned" by the file could be altered in the FAT by CHKDSK. When the file is
closed and MS-DOS finishes updating the FAT and the directory, you may be left
with an error in the FAT.
