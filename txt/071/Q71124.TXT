SUMMARY
=======

When you use Terminal to communicate to a direct connected host machine, such as
a serial connection to a mainframe, you do not need to dial a number to get a
connection. Just make sure that the settings and the terminal emulation mode are
set correctly, then press the ENTER key twice to start the communications.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you use a null modem cable between two PCs, you may need to take the
following additional steps:

1. Turn Local Echo on or you cannot see what you are typing even though it
   appears on the other machine.

2. Turn Outbound CR -> CR/LF on, or when you press the ENTER key, it
   overwrites the last line.
