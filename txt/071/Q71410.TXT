SUMMARY
=======

In the Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit (SDK) for HyperCard, the
following function sets the message's "Add recipients to Address Book" flag.
This function affects only the current message.

      msmail(SetAddToAddressBook, messageRef [, boolean])

This function simulates the Add Recipients to Address Book option in the Options
dialog box of the message's send screen. The default boolean is true.

For example, the following commands will add the recipients of this message to
the Address Book:

      put msmail (createMessage) into messageRef
      get msmail (setAddToAddressBook, messageRef, true)
