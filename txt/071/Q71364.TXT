The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Program Manager (PROGMAN.EXE) included with Windows 3.0 has an
80-character limit in the Command Line text entry box in the Program Item
Properties dialog box. (This dialog box can be accessed by choosing
Properties from the File menu.) There is no way to get beyond this
limitation. If the pathnames to your programs are very long, you may want
to consider placing these pathnames in the AUTOEXEC.BAT or some other batch
file that you run before starting Windows. This way, just the executable
needs to be on the command line.

NOTE: MS-DOS itself has a limitation of 128 characters on its command line.
Additional character length in the Program Manager Command Line field is
available in Windows 3.1, which allows up to 128 characters.

Additional query words: 3.00 win30 windrvr 3.00a 3.10 3.11
