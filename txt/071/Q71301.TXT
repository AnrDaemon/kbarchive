SUMMARY
=======

A mouse is not listed as a system requirement on the envelope in which run-time
ToolBook version 1.00 is packaged. This package comes with Windows 3.0.

A mouse is necessary to be able to access all the features in both TourBook (An
Introduction to ToolBook) and DayBook. Without a mouse, TourBook does not allow
you to select or execute any of the tutorials. In DayBook, the keyboard allows
you to access the file menu options only.

You will be able to successfully exit both programs using keyboard commands:

   In TourBook: ALT+SPACE, close.

   In DayBook: ALT+F, exit.


Additional query words: 3.00 3.0 3rdparty 3.00a
