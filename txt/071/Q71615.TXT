TITLE   :Timer in Minesweeper Will Not Start

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

If you start the Minesweeper game packaged with the Windows Entertainment Pack
volume 1, minimize it as an icon, and restart Minesweeper, the timer may not
start.

This problem occurs if you have started a second instance of Minesweeper by
restarting the application through the icon in Program Manager rather than
clicking the Minesweeper icon located on the background.

Solution
--------

Double-click the original version of Minesweeper after you have minimized it as
an icon to resume your game and the timer.
