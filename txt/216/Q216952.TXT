OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a new volume after installing Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4, you
get the following message in the error log:

   Event ID: 12035
   Source: MacFIle
   Error description: "Volume information for "volume name" could not be loaded.
   Setting defaults."

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because error checking for volume information was enhanced
in the Windows NT SP4 release and, because the volume has not yet been created,
the Services for Macintosh service cannot find this information.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, do a controlled restart of the computer and you
will see that no errors are posted to the event log and that the volume is
functioning normally.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0.
