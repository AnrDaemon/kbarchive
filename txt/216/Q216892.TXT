SUMMARY
=======

As part of the default installation process in Windows NT, the Microsoft
Exchange Mail client software is included without providing the user with an
option to manually disable the installation of the client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To prevent the Exchange Mail client from loading during a Windows NT
installation (before beginning the installation process), do the following:

1. Copy the <\i386> folder from the installation CD to a partition on a
   computer running Windows NT. For example, if your CD-ROM drive is drive D,
   and you want to copy the folder to your drive C, type "copy d:\i386 c:\i386"
   (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER.

2. At a command prompt, change to the new <\i386> folder's location, type
   "expand Syssetup.in_ Syssetup.inf" (without the quotation marks), and then
   press ENTER.

3. At the same command prompt, rename the Syssetup.in_ file. To do this, type
   "ren syssetup.in_ syssetup.old" (without the quotation marks) and then press
   ENTER.

4. Use a standard text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad, to edit the
   Syssetup.inf file. In the [BaseWinOptionsInfs] section, locate the line
   containing the Msmail.inf entry and type a semicolon at the beginning of the
   line.

5. Save and exit the Syssetup.inf file.

You can now begin the Windows NT installation process from the <\i386>
folder containing the modified Syssetup.inf file (which will prevent the
Exchange Mail client from loading).
