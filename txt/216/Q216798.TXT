TITLE   :XFOR: Embedded OLE Objects Are Not Converted
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a MAPI client embeds an OLE object into a mail message and sends it either
out of the Internet Mail Service to a user on the Internet or to a user on
Exchange Server who retrieves mail using POP3 or IMAP, the recipient may not
receive the OLE object. This happens regardless of which client is use by the
recipient. A placeholder that looks like "<<...>>" is found in place
of the OLE object. There is no indication to the recipient that this placeholder
indicates non-transferred data.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server 4.0, 5.0, and
5.5.
