OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you check the properties of a shared printer by using the Printers folder,
you may get the following error message after you click OK, even without making
any changes:

   Printer setting could not Be saved. Data area passed to a system call is too
   small.
   122L Error_insufficiant_Buffer

You may also find that this shared printer does not appear in the shared
resources list when you click Shares in the Server tool in Control Panel, or
when you do a net view command.

Also, Network clients will not be able to see the printer when trying to browse
and connect to it.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur if the specific printer's share on the print server becomes
corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Click Start, click Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Right-click the problem printer, and then click Sharing.

3. Write down the share name of the printer.

4. Stop sharing this printer by clicking the Not Shared radio button, and then
   close the printer folder.

5. Open Control Panel, double-click Services, select the Spooler Service, click
   Stop, and then click Start.

6. After the Spooler Service restarts, open the printer folder and re-create the
   printer share using the share name found in step 3. Do this by clicking
   Start, clicking Settings, and then clicking Printers. Right-click the problem
   printer, and then click Sharing. Click the Shared radio button, and then
   share the printer with the same name as before.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The above steps are a workaround that should eliminate the error message
received when viewing the printer's properties and also enable the printer to
again be seen on the network.

This exact cause of the share corruption is not known at this time.
