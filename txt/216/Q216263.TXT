SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing Windows NT 4.0 Evaluation Edition (Workstation, Server,
or Server Enterprise Edition), you may receive the following prompt during the
final stage of Setup:

   Windows NT Setup

   The date and time indicated by your computer's clock appear to Setup to be
   inaccurate, which may affect proper operation of this evaluation version of
   Windows NT.

After you click OK, you can modify the date and time settings.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you install an older version of Windows NT 4.0
Evaluation Edition after December 31, 1998.

RESOLUTION
==========

Click OK when you are prompted to verify the clock settings, and then click OK
to accept the current clock settings. After you do so, Windows NT 4.0 Evaluation
Edition will function normally for the full 120-day evaluation period.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in earlier Windows NT 4.0
Evaluation Edition products.

This behavior does not occur with the current Windows NT 4.0 Evaluation Edition
products.
