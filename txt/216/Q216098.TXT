======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While working in Visual C++ on a project with source files in many directories,
the performance of the IDE may appear to be slow or non-responsive.

CAUSE
=====

This can happen if you have your source files spread across 63 or more
directories on FAT or FAT32 partitions. The method that Visual C++ uses to get
file change notifications scans source files in the 63rd and above directories
every 5 seconds.


RESOLUTION
==========

Some possible resolutions are:

 - If your operating system is Windows NT or Windows 2000, place all of your
   source files on an NTFS partition.

NOTE: If the project is on an NTFS partition, Developer Studio scans a single
file so the amount of activity should be significantly less.

 - Place your source files in less than 63 directories.

 - Reduce the number of source files in the 63rd and above directories.


STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
