======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This problem occurs while creating class definitions in the source editor.
Certain coding sequences cause Visual C++ to close without error or warning.

CAUSE
=====

There are two possible causes of this problem; both happen when attempting to
create a derived class:

 - An object is coded before the class definition in the same source file.

 - The base class is accidentally named the same as the derived class.

RESOLUTION
==========

Always type the skeleton of a class definition before coding objects of that
class. Another solution is to always edit the class definition in its own header
file rather than in the source file where it is used.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information
about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

WARNING: The following steps reproduce the behavior described above, terminating
Visual C++ without an opportunity to save any work.

Coding an object before the class definition:

1. Open any project and any .cpp file in that project.

2. Declare a global variable as follows:

   CCrashTest Test;

3. Move the cursor to the line above that declaration and enter the following
   line of code:

   class CCrashTest : public CBaseClass
   {
   }

Deriving a class from itself:

1. Open any project and any .cpp file in that project.

2. Type the following class definition in. Make sure there is a space at the end
   of the first line.

   class CCrashTest : public CCrashTest
