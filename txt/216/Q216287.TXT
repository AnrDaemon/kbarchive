TITLE   :XFOR: IMAP4 Extractor Does Not Migrate Filed Messages
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Migration Wizard to migrate messages from an Internet Message
Access Protocol 4 (IMAP4) e-mail server, you may notice that some e-mail
messages are not migrated.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Netscape e-mail clients have a command called the File command. This command
moves an e-mail message to another folder. The e-mail message is copied to the
destination folder and then marked as deleted. The IMAP4 source extractor does
not migrate deleted e-mail messages, so these deleted e-mail messages are not
migrated to Exchange Server.

Additional query words: purge messenger
