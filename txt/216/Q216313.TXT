TITLE   :XADM: Exchange Admin Unable to Map SIDs to Account Names After 5
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fixkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program can be installed and run
from computers running Windows NT Workstation. If the workstation computer is in
a domain with a one-way trust, such that the domain where the Exchange Server
computers reside trusts the domain where the computers running Windows NT
workstation reside, but the reverse is not true, the Exchange Server
Administration program may not be able to administer the Exchange Key Management
Server (KMS) features from these computers running Windows NT Workstation.

When you attempt to view the KMS properties dialog box with the Exchange Server
Administrator program, you will be prompted for the KMS password. After you type
the password, a message box with the following error message may be displayed:

   No mapping between account names and security IDs was done.

This only occurs if any of the Exchange KMS administrator accounts are in the
Exchange Server domain.

CAUSE
=====

In Exchange Server 5.0, the Exchange Server Administrator program requests the
account names of the KMS administrators. In Exchange Server 5.5, the Exchange
Server Administrator program was requesting the security IDs (SIDs) of the KMS
administrators. This required that the Exchange Server Administrator program map
the SIDs back into names. Because the domain that the computers running Windows
NT Workstation are in does not trust the domain the Exchange Server computers
are in, the Exchange Server Administrator program will not ask the Exchange
Server domain to map the SIDs to strings.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: KMS

+------------------------+
| File name | Version    | 
+------------------------+
| Admin.exe | 5.5.2549.0 | 
+------------------------+


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you could set up a two-way trust between the two
domains. A second workaround would be to move the computers running Windows NT
Workstation into the same domain as the Exchange Server computers.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.
