TITLE   :Cluster Server Log Filling w/ Erroneous Security Descriptor Info
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After the installation of Windows NT Service Pack 4, Cluster Server logging will
now capture much more information than is necessary. The unnecessary information
is Security Descriptor information. For example,

   279::21-23:46:51.543 [ClRtlCopySecurityDescriptor] psd = 0x0019a600
   1a8::21-23:46:51.543 [API] Did not find Security Descriptor key in the cluster
   DB

CAUSE
=====

While adding logging capabilities during Service Pack 4 timeframe, the code
logged all the Security Descriptor logable events, instead of determining when
they would be valid. In this situtation, they are only valid in a mixed Windows
NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 cluster configuration.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:
