The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Setting the default value of an Optional Byte argument to TRUE causes the
following error when the project is compiled with Binary Compatibility:

   <procedure> in the <class> class module has arguments and/or a
   return type that is incompatible with a similar declaration in the
   version-compatible component

RESOLUTION
==========

Use 255 instead of TRUE for the default value.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new ActiveX DLL project.

2. Insert the following code into Class1:

   Option Explicit

   Public Function meth1(pf1 As String, Optional pf2 As Byte = True) As Boolean
   ' Sample method
   End Function

3. From the File menu, select Make Project1.DLL.

4. From the Project menu, select Project1 Properties.

5. Click on the Component tab.

6. Set the Version Compatibility to Binary Compatibility.

7. Verify that Project1.dll is listed in the File Location box at the bottom of
   the form.

8. Close the Project Properties dialog box.

9. Select Make Project1.dll from the File menu. Change the path to the DLL so
   that it is in a different location than the originally-compiled version of
   project1.dll and click OK. The error occurs at this point.
