TITLE   :HOWTO: Disable IRDP Automatically Using WSH VBScript
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:kbOSWin

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to create a VBScript file that automatically disables
IRDP (Internet Router Discovery Protocol) under Windows 98 or Windows 95 using
Windows Script Host.

MORE INFORMATION
================


IRDP can be disabled manually by adding "PerformRouterDiscovery" value name and
setting it to a dword value of 0, under the following registry key(s):

   HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\NetTrans\####

   Where #### is the binding for TCP/IP. More than one TCP/IP binding may exist.

Please note that if you are using Windows 95 and want to run the script to
disable IRDP, you need to install Wsh.exe from the MSDN Online Scripting MSDN
Online Scripting (http://msdn.microsoft.com/scripting) Web site to enable
Windows Script Host.

NOTE: This procedure is not intended for home users with a few computers. IRDP is
enabled on Windows 95 only after the Winsock 2 update is installed.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Use the following line to run NO-IRDP.vbs from a login script:

   Cscript \\<server>\<share>\NO-IRDP.VBS //T:5 //B

Where <server> is the name of the server and <share> is the name of
the share.

   //T:5  Terminates the script after 5 seconds if it is still running.
   //B    Tells the script to run in non-interactive mode.

Sample Code
-----------

Using a text editor, create a VBScript file called NO-IRDP.vbs with the following
lines:

      '----------------------------------------------------------------------
      ' The following script reads the registry value name IPAddress to
      ' determine which registry entries are TCP/IP bindings and disables
      ' IRDP (Internet Router Discovery Protocol).  For more info on IRDP
      ' please read RFC 1256.
      ' This sample checks the first 13 network bindings for TCP/IP, which 
      ' is typically sufficient in most environments.
      ' ---------------------------------------------------------------------
      Dim WSHShell, NList, N, IPAddress, IPValue, RegLoc
      Set WSHShell = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")

      NList = array("0000","0001","0002","0003","0004","0005","0006", _
                    "0007","0008","0009","0010","0011","0012")

      On Error Resume Next
      RegLoc = "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\NetTrans\"
    
      For Each N In NList
        IPValue = ""      'Resets variable
        IPAddress = RegLoc & N & "\IPAddress"
        IPValue = WSHShell.RegRead(IPAddress)
        If (IPValue <> "") then
          PFRD = RegLoc & N & "\PerformRouterDiscovery"
          WSHShell.RegWrite PFRD,"0","REG_DWORD"
        end If
      Next

      WScript.Quit        ' Tells the script to stop and exit.<BR/>
