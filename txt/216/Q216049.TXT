TITLE   :XCLN: MAPIResolveName Doesn't Properly Handle DBCS Strings
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A simple Messaging Application Program Interface (MAPI) application passes a
Double-Byte Character Set (DBCS) string to the MAPI call MAPIResolveName().
MAPIResolveName fails when a two-byte DBCS character contains 0x5b or 0x5c as
one of its bytes.

CAUSE
=====

A supporting routine used by MAPIResolveName() was not written to properly
handle DBCS strings, and mistakenly interprets the bytes 0x5b and 0x5c as '['
and '\' respectively.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.
