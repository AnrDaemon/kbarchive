KEYWORDS:kbenv kbhw kbui kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, on platform(s):
    - the hardware: DEC Alpha 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0, on platform(s):
    - the hardware: DEC Alpha 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you restart your computer after installing Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 on
a Compaq Alpha-based computer with a Mylex RAID controller, you may receive the
following error message:

   STOP 0x0000007B - Inaccessible Boot Device

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the Mylex RAID controller has a DMA configuration
conflict with the new hardware abstraction layer (HAL) in Windows NT 4.0 Service
Pack 4. Because of this DMA conflict, the RAID controller is unavailable when
you start your computer, and the error message is generated.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, contact Compaq to inquire about the availability of a fix
for this issue.
