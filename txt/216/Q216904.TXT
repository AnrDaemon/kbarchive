SUMMARY
=======

You can access a user's Client Authentication certificate from the Windows 2000
Active Directory. A Client Authentication certificate is an optional
UserCertificate property on the user object.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following Visual Basic or Visual Basic Script code will access the
UserCertificate object:

   Dim oUser, vCert
   Dim strName, strDN
   StrName = "CN=Frodo Baggins"
   StrDN = "CN=Users,DC=iis,DC=nttest,DC=microsoft,DC=com"
   Set oUser = GetObject("LDAP://" & strName & "," & strDN)
   vCert = oUser.userCertificate
   Set oUser = Nothing

The strDN must be replaced with the domain information for your environment. In
this example, it is set to the Users object in the IIS.nttest.microsoft.com
domain.

You can set a user's client authentication certificate by using the Directory
Management administration tool.

Note: If Microsoft Certificate Services is installed, then the certificate is
automatically added to the user's list of certificates when the client requests
a certificate.
