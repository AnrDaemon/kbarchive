TITLE   :BUG: 'Errors occurred' Results When Converting OS/390 Signed Zon
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft OLE DB Provider for AS/400 and VSAM, versions 1.0, 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Using Microsoft OLEDB Provider for AS/400 and VSAM, a zoned decimal type on an
OS/390 host may not be converted correctly to either string, numeric, or decimal
automation types on the client. The following information is contained in the
err structure:

   Source: Provider
   Number: -2147217887 (0x80040E21)
   Description: Errors occurred

The zoned decimal type is determined in the Host Column Description (HCD) file
using the product's Microsoft Management Console snap-in for administration. To
specify the zoned decimal type for a particular host column, its 'Host Type'
property is set to 'Zoned'.

If the low order byte of the host variable indicates a "+" or "-" sign, data
conversion fails.

If the low order byte indicates no sign, that is, the absolute value, conversion
works correctly.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use 'Character' instead of 'Zoned' for the 'Host Type' property. Specify the
automation type as 'DBTYPE_STR'. Determine the sign and value of the low order
byte programatically.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
