   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After a Terminal Server client loses the connection to a Terminal Server, the
session on the Terminal Server may not transition to a disconnected state,
instead, it may remain active even though the client is physically disconnected
from the Terminal Server. If the client logs back in to the same Terminal
Server, a totally new session may be established, and the original session may
still remain active.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because Terminal Server implements a Keep Alive mechanism.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

For Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition
------------------------------------------

To work around this issue:

1. Apply the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0, Terminal Server Edition.

2. Use Registry Editor to add a DWORD value, "KeepAliveEnable" (without the
   quotation marks), with a Positive numeric value of 1 (which represents 1
   minute) to the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server

3. In the "Terminal Server Connection Configuration" tool, double-click rdp-tcp,
   and then click Advanced.

4. On the "On a broken or timed-out connection, <connect action> the
   session" line, click to clear the inherit user config option. Click
   Disconnect on "On a broken or timed-out connection, <connect action>
   the session", and then click OK.

For Windows 2000 Terminal Server
--------------------------------

1. Use Registry Editor to add a DWORD value, "KeepAliveEnable" (without the
   quotation marks), with a positive numeric value of 1 (which represents 1
   minute) to the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server

2. Open "Terminal Services Configuration" in Administrative Tools, double-click
   RDP-Tcp in the Connections folder and click the Sessions tab.

3. Click to select "Override user settings" and make sure that "Disconnect from
   session" is selected and then click OK.
