TITLE   :Unable to Create a Large Number of DHCP Scopes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a large number of Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
scopes with exclusions within each scope, the following error message may be
displayed when the computer is restarted twice:

   Windows NT could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt:
   \%SystemRoot%\System32\Config\System\Hardware Profile/Last Known Good menu

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because the scopes, exclusions, or reservations added to
the DHCP scopes generate large amounts of KEY data to the registry.

The SYSTEM hive is limited in size and must fit below 16 MB to start the system.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0. This problem was
first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The resolution to this problem is not found in the DHCP service but rather in
how the size of the registry is managed. Documentation on the actual fix is
available in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:
