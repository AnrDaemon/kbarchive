-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP3 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Users with all the required rights may have problems backing up files to a
server on the network. When this occurs, the error message in the backup log
reads:

   Unable to connect to network drive. Logon type not granted

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Everyone group on the destination server does not
have "Access this computer from network" rights.

RESOLUTION
==========

Check to make sure the "Access this computer from network" right is granted to
the Everyone group on the destination server. You can use the User Manager for
Domains tool to do this.

The Backup Operators group cannot gain access to the resource on the server if
this right is not granted to the Everyone group.
