======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a Setup that was created using the Package and Deployment Wizard
(PDW), you receive one of the following error messages:

   Cannot start main setup program! (CreateProcess() returned error code
   0x000000C1H)

   VB6stkit.dll is not a valid Windows NT image

   The system could not locate the file '<Temp
   Folder>\Msftqws.pdw\Vb6stkit.dll'. Would you like to browse for the file
   yourself?

   The system could not locate the file '<Temp
   Folder>\Windows\Temp\Msftqws.pdw\St6unst.exe'. Would you like to browse
   for the file yourself?

where <Temp Folder> is the Windows\Temp folder on Windows 95, Windows 98,
or Windows Me or the folder specified by the TEMP environment variable on
Windows NT.


CAUSE
=====

If the symptom occurs on all target computers where you run Setup, the cause of
the problem is most likely one of the following:

 - A damaged diskette.

 - A damaged setup file.

If the symptom only occurs on some target computers, the cause may be one of the
following:

 - Left-over files from a previous installation attempt.

 - A machine-specific issue.

RESOLUTION
==========

Test for Damaged Diskette
-------------------------

Try deploying the Setup package to a different set of diskettes, or use a disk
scanning utility, such as ScanDisk, to verify the integrity of the current set
of diskettes.

NOTE: When using ScanDisk, select the Thorough option. The Standard option does
not detect all disk errors.

Test for Damaged Files
----------------------

1. Create a test folder on the hard drive of the target computer.

2. Copy the files from the Setup diskettes to the test folder:

   a. If you receive error messages indicating the copy failed, the diskette may
      be damaged (see the "Test for Damaged Diskettes" section of this article),
      or there may be a problem with the floppy disk drive.

   b. If the copy succeeds, continue with the next step.

3. Run Setup.exe from the test folder on the hard drive.

   a. If the Setup succeeds when run from the hard drive, this indicates one of
      the diskettes may be damaged (see the "Test for Damaged Diskettes" section
      of this article), or there may be a problem with the floppy disk drive.

   b. If the Setup fails with one of the error messages listed in the "Symptoms"
      section of this article, continue with the next step

4. If the Setup succeeds when run from the hard drive, this indicates one of the
   diskettes may be damaged (see the "Test for Damaged Diskettes" section of
   this article), or there may be a problem with the floppy disk drive.

5. If the Setup fails with one of the error messages listed in the SYMPTOMS
   article, continue with the next step.

6. To determine whether a .cab file is corrupt, manually extract the files from
   the .cab file(s). To extract the contents of a cabinet file, you must use the
   Extract utility.

   Extract.exe can be found in your Windows or Winnt folder or on your Windows
   95, Windows 98, Windows NT, or Windows 2000 installation CD or diskettes.

   Extract.exe is a command-line utility. Therefore, it is used from an MS-DOS
   command prompt. To extract the files within a cabinet file, be sure the
   Extract.exe utility is in the MS-DOS path, or copy the Extract utility to the
   same folder as the cabinet file.

   From the MS-DOS command prompt, you can run the following command to extract
   all of the files in a .cab file into the current directory:

   extract.exe /e /a <File Name>.cab

   where <File Name> is the name of your cabinet file. If there are
   multiple .cab files in the setup, <File Name> should be the first .cab
   in the series. If all the files extract successfully, the .cab file is not
   corrupted. However, the .cab file is corrupted if you receive the following
   error message:

   ERROR: Cabinet file <File Name>.cab is corrupted

   where <File Name> is the name of the .cab file you just extracted.

   NOTE: In some cases, a .cab file may be damaged even though you are able to
   successfully extract the files from it. Try re-running the PDW or running the
   .bat file in the \Support folder to recreate the .cab file(s). After
   recreating the cabinet file(s), verify that they are not corrupt by manually
   extracting the files again, and then retrying the installation.

   For additional information about rebuilding cabinet files by running a .bat
   file, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191212 HOWTO: Modify and Rebuild .CAB Files Built with PDW

   For more information on using the Extract.exe utility, you can type the
   following command at an MS-DOS command prompt:

   extract.exe /?

   For even more information on Extract.exe, please see the ActiveX SDK
   documentation as referred to in the REFERENCES section of this article.

Test for Setup Files Left on System
-----------------------------------

If the symptom occurred after a previous installation attempt of the same
application failed (for example, the computer stopped responding during setup),
follow these steps:

1. On the target computer, search for a copy of your application's .cab file(s)
   in the Windows folder (or Winnt folder on NT or Windows 2000). If found,
   delete the .cab file(s).

   Setup places the .cab file(s) in the Windows or Winnt folder and removes them
   at the end of a successful Setup. However, if the installation program exits
   abnormally, the .cab files may be left on the system.

2. In the Windows\Temp folder (or the folder specified by the TEMP environment
   variable on NT or Windows 2000), look for a subfolder named Msftqws.pdw. If
   found, delete the subfolder.

3. On the target computer, locate the following files. If any of these files
   have a size of 0 bytes, delete the file:

   \Windows\System\Vb6stkit.dll (or \Winnt\System32\Vb6stkit.dll)

   \Windows\St6unst.exe (or \Winnt\St6unst.exe)

4. Run Setup again.

Machine-Specific Problem
------------------------

If the troubleshooting suggestions in this article do not resolve the problem,
there may be something specific about the configuration of the target computer
that is causing the error.

Please contact Microsoft Technical Support for further assistance.
