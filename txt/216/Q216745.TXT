SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to improve the performance of a Discussion Web. By
implementing one of the following methods, you can reduce the time it takes to
make a new post to the Discussion Web.

MORE INFORMATION
================

FrontPage 98 Discussion Webs can exhibit slow performance as the size of the Web
increases and the number of posts increase. The performance degradation most
notably occurs linearly as new posts are made. To increase performance, you can
make a configuration change to the FrontPage 98 Discussion Web. To do this, use
the steps listed below.

Each time a post is made to the Discussion Web, several parses occur from the
Server Extensions. To reduce the number of parses, complete the following steps,
which will prevent the Toc.htm from being created, and delete the existing one.

1. Open the Discussion Web in FrontPage.

2. Open the Disc#_post.htm file in the FrontPage Editor.

3. Select the HTML view.

4. Find the HTML code "b-make-toc="True".

5. Modify this code to "b-make-toc="False". When you do this, FrontPage will not
   create the Toc.htm page, which reduces the amount of parses and increases
   performance.

6. Save the page and close the FrontPage Editor.

7. In FrontPage Explorer, select Tools, select Web Settings, and then click the
   Advanced tab.

8. Select the "Show documents in hidden directories" check box, and then click
   Apply.

9. Click Yes to refresh the Web, and the click OK.

10. In the Folder View, view the contents of the _disc# folder.

11. Locate the Toc.htm file and delete it.

12. Select Tools, and choose Recalculate Hyperlinks.

With these changes made, you should begin to see increased performance when
making new posts.
