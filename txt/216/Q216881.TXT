TITLE   :Line Added to Autoexec.bat on Client Cannot Be Truncated
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbenv kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Microsoft Windows 95-based or Microsoft Windows 98-based Systems Management
Server (SMS) 2.0 client may receive an "Out of environment space" error message
and the client software may not be correctly installed if the line that is added
to the client's Autoexec.bat file is manipulated every time the system is
rebooted.

For example, this behavior can be caused by a program file in the Autoexec.bat
file that truncates all lines to 80 characters. Because the line that is added
by SMS contains over 80 characters, the line is truncated. The SMS Client
service detects that the line is not correct and adds it again to the first
line. This process continues until eventually there are many truncated lines and
the client receives an "Out of environment space" error message at startup.

CAUSE
=====

When an SMS 2.0 client is installed, the following line is added to the
Autoexec.bat file:

   if not "%OS%"=="Windows_NT" if "%COMSPEC%"=="C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND.COM" set
   SMS_LOCAL_DIR=C:\WINDOWS

Each time the SMS Client service is started, it checks to make sure that the line
in the Autoexec.bat file is present and complete. If not, it adds the line to
the top of the Autoexec.bat file.

A known cause of this behavior is an Aztech audio driver that is placed in the
Autoexec.bat file. During startup, it truncates all lines in the Autoexec.bat
file to 80 characters if the /A:ON switch is present. For example:

   AZTPNP.EXE /A:ON

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, remove this switch or the driver itself.
