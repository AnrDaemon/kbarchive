SUMMARY
=======

This article describes some errors in the Microsoft Systems Management Server
2.0 Administrator's Guide about SQL Server requirements.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Systems Management Server 2.0 Administrator's Guide incorrectly states
SQL Server 6.5 Service Pack 5 or later as a requirement for Systems Management
Server 2.0. The errors are in Chapter 5 on page 127, and in Appendix A on page
669.

Systems Management Server 2.0 running with SQL Server 6.5 requires SQL Server 6.5
Service Pack 4 or later. In addition to applying SQL Server 6.5 Service Pack 4,
you should copy the Sqlcrt60.dll file from the Sqlsetup\Sqlhotfix folder on the
Systems Management Server 2.0 CD-ROM to the Mssql\Binn folder on the SQL Server
computer.
