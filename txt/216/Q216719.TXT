TITLE   :Internet Explorer Stops Responding When Connecting to SSL-Enable
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSiteServ300sp1fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to an IIS computer with Internet Explorer version 3.0 or later
using SSL (HTTPS), the browser may appear to stop responding. The browser
eventually displays the following error message:

   Internet Explorer cannot open the Internet site https://sitename. The
   operation timed out

CAUSE
=====

This problem may be related to an improperly set SSL port, or a malformed URL.
The standard port for an SSL connection is port 443. When HTTPS is used in an
Internet browser, port 443 is assumed. If your Web site is set to use a
different port, then the user must specify the new port within the URL. If the
port is incorrect, then the server is never really contacted, which produces
this behavior.

RESOLUTION
==========

The user's request should be formatted as follows (the SSL port is 230 in this
example):

   https://www.microsoft.com:230

In the case of a virtual directory in the request:

   https://www.microsoft.com:230/vdir/resource.htm
