   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) both have the
ability to use different ciphers, depending on the abilities of the connecting
client. By default, all ciphers can be used; however, you can also choose the
ciphers you want to allow (for example, only allowing RC4 using 64/128 and
Skipjack for Fortezza). It is important to note that changing these values will
affect ciphers on the entire computer. Internet Explorer, for example, uses the
same registry entries to determine the ciphers that are available for use.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To choose the ciphers you want to allow, perform the following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Run, and type "Regedt32.exe" (without the quotation
   marks).

2. Locate the following registry key:

   
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProvid
   ers\SCHANNEL\Ciphers

3. In the list of available ciphers, select one of the ciphers you do not want
   to use. In the right pane, view the "Enabled" value for this entry. The value
   can be one of the following:

   0xffffffff (enabled)
   0x0 (disabled)

4. Click Enabled, choose Edit, and then choose Modify.

5. In the "Edit DWORD Value" window, make sure that the Value is set to Enabled
   and that the Base Value is set to Hexadecimal.

6. In the Value Data box, delete the previous value and change it to enabled or
   disabled by entering 0 (zero) for disabled, or "ffffffff" (without the
   quotation marks) for enabled.

7. Click OK.

8. Restart the Internet Information Services for the changes to take effect.
