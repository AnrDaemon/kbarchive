TITLE   :XFOR: Extra Space in Notes Proxy Address Causes Mail to NDR
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Lotus Notes users may receive a non-delivery report (NDR) when replying to an
e-mail message originating from Exchange Server. This NDR might result from
recent changes made on the Exchange Server, particularly to the Notes proxy
address of the Exchange Server user.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Notes Connector does not know how to handle extra spaces in the
Notes proxy address of Exchange Server users. This might be a result of
modifying the Notes proxy address generation rule under Site Addressing to a
format that might generate a space.

For example:

   &g &i &s/Site/Org@Exchange)

A user that did not have a middle initial would contain a Notes proxy address of
similar to the following:

   "John Smith/Site/Org@Exchange"

Note the extra space between John and Smith.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Notes Mail Connector

+---------------------------+
| File name    | Version    | 
+---------------------------+
| Ntspxgen.dll | 5.5.2533.0 | 
+---------------------------+


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, specify a Notes proxy address generator rule that
does not result in any addresses with an extra space. Administrators can also
manually correct the user's Notes proxy address by removing the extra space.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This issue might still be a problem if modifications to the Notes proxy address
were accomplished through some other mechanism, such as importing/exporting CSV
files, or through a dirsync mapping rule. Microsoft is aware of this problem.
