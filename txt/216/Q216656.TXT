======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 6.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When debugging your application in Visual C++ 6.0, you might get the following
error message

   No matching symbolic info found

for Comctl32.dll and Msidle.dll (and perhaps other files). This happens even
though you installed the .dbg files from the Vc98\Debug directory of the Visual
Studio 6.0 CD-ROM.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error message is due to the symbol (.dbg) files for the indicated DLLs not
being installed or being out-of-date with respect to the DLLs. Installing a
version of Internet Explorer may have updated the DLLs with later versions. You
can ignore this error message because you should be able to debug your
application successfully without these files anyway.

Msidle.dll is a component of the Internet Explorer upgrade, which does not
provide symbol files. Internet Explorer upgrades may update Comctl32.dll and
other operating system files, making the existing symbol files provided for the
original operating system or service pack versions out-of-date with respect to
the new DLLs.

Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack and later contain newer versions of
Comctl32.dll and its symbol file than those shipped on the Visual C++ 6.0
CD-ROM. Installing the latest service pack and its updated symbol files will
enable Visual C++ to load those symbols. Currently, the service pack download
page also contains a link to download the symbols. The Windows NT Service Packs
and service pack symbols are available on the Web at:
