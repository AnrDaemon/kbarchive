   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to determine the date format that is displayed to
users when they log on to a computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A user can configure the date format using the Regional Settings tool in Control
Panel.

You can apply a policy to a computer to control the date format that is displayed
to the user (for example, MM/dd/yy or MM/dd/yyyy). The following registry key
controls the date format:

   Path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\International
   Name: sShortDate
   Type: REG_SZ
   Default value for U.S. English: MM/dd/yy

The following example shows the different values you can use for this registry
key, and how the date is displayed for a specified value:

Value          Result
MM/dd/yy       03/08/98
M/d/yy         3/8/98
M/d/yyyy       3/8/1998
MM/dd/yyyy     03/08/1998
yy/MM/dd       98/03/08
dd-MMM-yy      03-Mar-98

Through the use of policies in Windows NT 4.0, you can write a custom .adm file
and incorporate it into the policy file. For additional information about policy
files and custom .adm templates, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q185589 Guide To Windows NT 4.0 Profiles and Policies (Part 4 of 6)

You can cut and paste the following information into a file and save it as a
custom .adm file. After the .adm file is incorporated into the policy, you can
configure the date format for users.

----------Start of Date Format ADM----------
CLASS USER

CATEGORY !!DATE
	KEYNAME "Control Panel\International"
	
	POLICY !!ShortDateFormat
		PART !!DateFormatDesc         EDITTEXT REQUIRED
		VALUENAME sShortDate
