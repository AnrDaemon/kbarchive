TITLE   :SMS: Client Installation Requires a Valid TEMP Directory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbUpgrade

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The System.ini file is deleted after upgrading a Systems Management Server 1.2
client. When upgrading to Systems Management Server 2.0, the migration logs
contain no reference to removing the System.ini file.

On 16-bit Windows clients, the result is that Windows cannot be started.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the client's TEMP environment variable is set to a
directory that does not exist when upgrade is attempted. The client upgrade
process attempts to write a new System.ini file into the Temp directory, with
the following process:

1. Open C:\%windir%\System.ini to read original file.

2. Write to C:\%temp%\System.ini.

However, when the TEMP environment variable is invalid, Windows returns the
Windows directory for a Temp path. Therefore, the C:\%windir%\System.ini is
opened for both read and write. As a result, the original System.ini file is
overwritten.

WORKAROUND
==========

Prevention is the only way to avoid this problem. Before upgrading the clients,
look at the Systems Management Server 1.2 inventory data to determine if any
clients do not have the environment variable set for TEMP=. If clients are
missing the TEMP variable, you can create and distribute a Systems Management
Server Installer file to the affected clients to create the Temp directory and
set the environment variable in the Autoexec.bat (for 16-bit clients) file or
the registry (for 32-bit clients).

Note that it is also possible to use Systems Management Server to back up the
System.ini file locally on the client or to collect it before upgrade.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
