======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0SP1, 3.0SP2, 3.0SP3, 4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Printing may appear faint when you use SNA Print Server to print to an Hewlett
Packard (HP) LaserJet printer. Characters may print so light, they are not
easily readable.

CAUSE
=====

The EconoMode setting may be enabled for the printer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, disable EconoMode in the Control Panel Printer settings
or on the printer driver. It is best to turn EconoMode on or off from the
printer driver. Driver settings override the Control Panel settings on the
printer. Refer to your printer documentation for the specific location of the
EconoMode option, as it may be not be in the same place in the driver properties
for all models.

MORE INFORMATION
================

EconoMode is used to extend the life of the toner cartridge. EconoMode uses
substantially less toner than normal printing, causing print jobs to print much
lighter. This is generally adequate for printing drafts or proofs, but may not
be preferable for SNA printing.
