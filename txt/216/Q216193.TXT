TITLE   :PC DirSync: WinNT Version of Import Cannot Add for Batch
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Windows NT version of Import.exe to batch import local users
into an MS Mail postoffice, you may have problems when you attempt to create
groups including these users even though the users were imported into the
postoffice. The following symptoms may occur:

1. Start The MS Mail Administrator program (Admin.exe), go to local admin group
   and create a group containing the newly imported users.

2. Select the first imported user by pressing SPACEBAR. The selection is
   confirmed by the ">>" characters displayed to the left of the name.

3. Press the down arrow key to go to the next user and again select the user by
   using pressing SPACEBAR, no ">>" characters are displayed.

4. Press SPACEBAR again and the ">>" characters are now displayed against
   the second user.

5. Continue to scroll through the list and every other user name that was
   imported displays the >> characters; suggesting that the user name is
   also selected.

CAUSE
=====

When the users are imported using the batch import method, their individual
Tuple Identifier (TID) values will all be set to zero. The TID value should be
unique for every user within a postoffice. The value is used when mail is sent
to a group and enables cross referencing of the group members to their
individual mailboxes.
