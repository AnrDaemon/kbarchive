MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two different sets of installation disks included in the Windows 95
retail release (Upgrade or Full version). One set of disks is for installing
Windows 95, which can be installed from a command prompt or from within Windows.
The other set of disks are for installing Internet Explorer, which must be
installed from within Windows. Both sets of disks have a disk labeled "Disk 1 -
Setup", so it is important to note the actual product name printed on the left
side of the disk label.
