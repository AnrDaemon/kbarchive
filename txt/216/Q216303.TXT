TITLE   :Incorrect NDIS Filtering of Some Ethernet Multicast Frames
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Some Ethernet multicast frames may be incorrectly identified as Ethernet
broadcast frames by the filtering logic in Ndis.sys.

Consequently, these multicast frames are not always delivered as expected to NDIS
packet drivers and higher layers of the network stack.

CAUSE
=====

Ethernet multicast frames are distinguished from directed packets by having the
Individual/Group (I/G) bit of the destination address set to 1 (Group).

The Ethernet broadcast address is defined to be 0xFFFFFFFFFFFF, which is a
special case of Ethernet multicast address.

Frames with an Ethernet multicast destination address whose first byte was 0xFF
were being incorrectly identified and treated as broadcast frames.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, choose an Ethernet multicast addressing scheme that
does not include Ethernet multicast addresses whose first byte is 0xFF.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
