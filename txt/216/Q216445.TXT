   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to control the interval used to delay the appearance of the
cascading menus when you click Start on the Taskbar.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To change the Start menu display interval, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, click Run, type "regedt32" (without the quotation marks), and
   then click OK.

2. On the Windows menu, click "HKEY_CURRENT_USER on Local Machine".

3. Click the \Control Panel\Desktop folder.

4. Double-click the MenuShowDelay value, type a number representing the menu
   display delay (in number of milliseconds) in the String box, and then click
   OK. You can enter any whole number between 0 and 4,000. If you use an entry
   of 0, there is no menu display delay.

5. Quit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.
