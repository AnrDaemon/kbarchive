SUMMARY
=======

Event logging in Windows provides a standard, centralized way for Windows and
other applications to record important software and hardware events. Event
logging also supplies a standard user interface for viewing the logs and a
programming interface for examining the logs.

This article illustrates how to get the number of records contained within a
specified Microsoft Windows 2000 or Windows NT Event Log with Visual Basic
version 4.0 and later. This can be done using the GetNumberOfEventLogRecords API
call. While Visual Basic 5.0 and later versions have built in functionality for
event logging, they do not provide the functionality that the Win32 API does.

================

The following example shows how to get the number of event log records in the
local Application Event Log.

Step by Step Example:

1. Create a new Visual Basic project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a command button to Form1. Change the name of the command button to
   cmdGetNumberOfEventLogRecords.

3. Add the following code to the Form1 code window:

   Private Declare Function GetNumberOfEventLogRecords Lib "advapi32.dll" ( _
       ByVal hEventLog As Long, _
       NumberOfRecords As Long) _
       As Long

   Private Declare Function CloseEventLog Lib "advapi32.dll" ( _
       ByVal hEventLog As Long) _
       As Long

   Private Declare Function OpenEventLog Lib "advapi32.dll" Alias "OpenEventLogA" ( _
       ByVal lpUNCServerName As String, _
       ByVal lpSourceName As String) _
       As Long

   Private Sub cmdGetNumberOfEventLogRecords_Click()
       Dim hEventLog As Long
       Dim lEventLogRecordCount As Long
       Dim lretv As Long
       
       hEventLog = OpenEventLog(vbNullString, "Application")
       If hEventLog = 0 Then
            Debug.Print "OpenEventLog Failed"
            Exit Sub
       End If
       
       lretv = GetNumberOfEventLogRecords(hEventLog, lEventLogRecordCount)
       If lretv = 0 Then
            Debug.Print GetNumberOfEventLogRecords Failed"
            Exit Sub
       Else
           Debug.Print "Number of records: " & CStr(lEventLogRecordCount)
       End If
                   
       lretv = CloseEventLog(hEventLog)
       If lretv = 0 Then
            Debug.Print "CloseEventLog Failed"
            Exit Sub
       End If

   End Sub

4. Press F5 to run the project, and then and click the
   cmdGetNumberOfEventLogRecords command button. A message box should appear
   that displays the number of records.
