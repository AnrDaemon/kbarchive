PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms120 kbsms120bug kbAdvertisement

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Systems Management Server 2.0 client runs an advertisement that returns a
non-zero exit code, the Available Program Manager (APM) reports that the
advertisement failed. Under these conditions, the client will also not be
restarted even though the Program Properties specify that Systems Management
Server will restart the computer.

This will happen even if the installation program creates a status MIF stating
"Success".

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because APM considered any non-zero exit code to be a failed
install, even if the installation status MIF stated success.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The updated APM will now read the status MIF created by the installation to
determine whether or not the process was successful. If the status MIF created
by your installation states success, APM will report that the Advertisement was
successful and restart the client if the program properties are set for it to do
so.

You can determine the version of APM that your clients are using by doing either
of the following:

 - On your site server, open the Compver.ini file in the
   SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Smsapm32 directory. If this file lists a version
   2.00.1239.0003 or later, you do not need the fix.

   -or-

 - On the Systems Management Server client, double-click the Systems Management
   icon in Control Panel and then click the Components tab. If the version
   number of the Available Programs Manager is 2.00.1239.0003 or later you do
   not need the fix.
