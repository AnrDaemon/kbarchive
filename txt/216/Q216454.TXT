======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

3270 print jobs may print with incorrect formatting if the 3270 print session is
configured to use the "No Line Formatting" option. The incorrect formatting
appears in the form of missing spaces that result in print data not being
properly positioned on the printed page.

The following example illustrates the problem:

- Expected print output

   

   This is a sample print job               Date
                                         2/2/1999

- Actual print output because of the problem described here.

   

   This is a sample print job               Date
        2/2/1999

The problem is that the data on the second line is not printed in the correct
position.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server's Host Print service fails to send all of the spaces (which are
denoted by EBCDIC X'40'characters) it receives to the printer when the "No Line
Formatting" option is selected in some circumstances.
