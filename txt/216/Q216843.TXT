TITLE   :Clients Receive "Error 1000 No Licenses Are Available"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2000,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When ICA clients attempt to connect to a Terminal Server computer running
MetaFrame, they may experience logon problems with regard to licensing. The
clients may receive the following error message:

   Error 1000 No Licenses Are Available.

The server also logs the following event ID:

   Event ID 1004
   Source: TermService
   Description: Unable to acquire a license for user <name>, domain
   <name>.

These symptoms are usually experienced in conjunction with excessive logon and
logoff attempts.

CAUSE
=====

The preceding error messages can occur if the Citrix MetaFrame server runs out
of pooled licenses. It is possible that the licenses were consumed by other
connections on different servers.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, change the License Pool Count by performing the
following steps:

1. Open the MetaFrame Tools group.

2. Click Citrix Licensing.

3. Select the installed license or licenses.

4. On the License menu, click Change Pool Count.

5. Change the number pooled accordingly.

NOTE: When using the Citrix client, installing their latest updates may resolve
the issue.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is recommended that you reserve a portion of the licenses as locally based
for administrative purposes. License usage can be monitored in Citrix Server
administration. By default, all Citrix MetaFrame licenses are pooled. This is by
design.
