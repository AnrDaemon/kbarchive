   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

The Event Viewer tool maintains three log files containing the System,
Application, and Security event messages. However, the Event Viewer tool may not
be able to write event messages to one of these log files if there is no disk
space available. To increase the disk space that can be used for these log
files, you can modify their default location.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To modify the location of the Event Viewer log files:

1. Click Start, click Run, type "regedt32" (without the quotation marks), and
   then click OK.

2. On the Windows menu, click "HKEY_LOCAL_ MACHINE on Local Machine".

    - For the System log:

      a. Click the System\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\System folder, and
         then double-click the FILE value.

      b. Type the new drive and path in the String box, include the file name
         \SysEvent.Evt, and then click OK. The default path is
         %SystemRoot%\System32\Config\SysEvent.Evt

    - For the Application log:

      a. Click the System\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\Application
         folder, and then double-click the FILE value.

      b. Type the new drive and path in the String box, include the file name
         \AppEvent.Evt, and then click OK. The default path is
         %SystemRoot%\System32\Config\AppEvent.Evt

    - For the Security log:

      a. Click the System\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\Security folder,
         and then double-click the FILE value.

      b. Type the new drive and path in the String box, include the file name
         \SecEvent.Evt, and then click OK. The default path is
         %SystemRoot%\System32\Config\SecEvent.Evt

3. Quit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.
