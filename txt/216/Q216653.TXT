======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 Service Packs 1, 2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you are using Exchange Server Advanced Security with the Certificate Server
included with the Windows NT Option Pack, that Certificate Server will only be
able to issue and verify certificates for Exchange Server Advanced Security.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Part of the process of setting up Exchange Server Advanced Security to use a
Certificate Server is to register the Exchange Server policy module
(Expolicy.dll) with the Certificate Server. After this policy module has been
registered and the Certificate Server service is restarted, that Certificate
Server will only be able to issue and verify certificates for Exchange Server.

If you need to have a Certificate Server for issuing and verifying certificates
outside of Exchange Server, then you will have to install another Certificate
Server to perform that functionality.
