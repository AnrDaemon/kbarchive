SUMMARY
=======

In order to use the SNA Server 4.0 SP2 COM Transaction Integrator "MS Link" type
Remote Environment to invoke link-model CICS transactions through TCP/IP, you
must write a Concurrent Server program that implements the functionality defined
by the Mscmtics.cbl sample "MS Link" program.

NOTE: Mscmtics.cbl is intended to be a demonstration program only, and is not for
production use.

REFERENCES
==========

The mainframe application requirements for implementing a TCP/IP Listener or the
Server function are documented in the following IBM publication:

IBM TCP/IP for MVS, CICS TCP/IP Socket Interface Guide and Reference, Document
Number SC31-7131-03

An additional resource is available to help you develop a server for the
IBM-provided listener: IBM provides a sample program EZACICSC.
