SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Microsoft Exchange Notes migration source extractor, you may
find that migrating from a Lotus Notes 3.x server can take a long time to
complete.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It has been found that when comparing two similarly configured servers on the
same hardware running different versions of Lotus Notes(3.x and 4.x), that the
migration time can be quite different. In some cases, the migration time from a
Notes 3.x server may be more than twice the amount of time compared to a Notes
4.x server. It appears that there are some efficiency issues between Notes 3.x
servers and Notes 4.x clients.
