TITLE   :XFOR: Cannot Install 5.5 SP2 Connectors after GroupWise
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When administrators attempt to install the Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2
(SP2) version of the Notes, SNADS, and OV/VM (PROFS) connectors after previously
installing the Web 3 GroupWise connector, Setup may stop with the following
error message:

   Installation Warning

   Setup has detected that you have a newer version of this connector already
   installed on your Exchange Server. If you wish to install this older version,
   you must uninstall the newer one.

   Setup is exiting.

CAUSE
=====

The Setup program will look for a version number in the registry of the latest
connector. When the GroupWise connector is installed the first time, it will
update the version number to 2521.0. However, the version number for the SP2
connectors is 2448.8, resulting in this conflict.

WORKAROUND
==========

Uninstall the GroupWise Connector, then install any needed connectors before
reinstalling the GroupWise Connector from Exchange Server 5.5 SP2.

Additional query words: notes, snads, profs, error, warning
