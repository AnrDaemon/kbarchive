TITLE   :XCLN: Can't Auto Forward Messages to SMTP Address with OOF
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5,8.0,8.01,8.02,8.03
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 exc55sp1 exc55sp2

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 97, versions 8.0, 8.01, 8.02, 8.03 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you have an Out of Office rule set to forward all messages to an external
SMTP address, it does not forward the messages. If the rule is configured to
forward messages to an internal e-mail address, the messages are forwarded
correctly.

CAUSE
=====

This functionality is disabled in the Internet Mail Service by default.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem and allow automatic forwarding to an SMTP address,
perform the following steps on the Exchange Server computer:

1. Click the Internet Mail tab on the Internet Mail Service.

2. Click the Advanced tab, and then click to clear the "Disable Out of Office
   responses to the Internet", and "Disable Automatic Replies to the Internet"
   check boxes.

NOTE: You must stop and start the Internet Mail Service for these changes to take
affect.
