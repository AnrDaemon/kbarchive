Internet if the originator asks for a receipt (Return-Receipt-To:). This can
open up a security hole as this will show a valid recipient on a Microsoft
Exchange system.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

There is a new registry entry that will prevent delivery receipts from being sent
to the Internet while allowing other auto-replies to be sent.
To add this new registry entry, perform the following steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters  

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

      Value Name: AlwaysSuppressDR
      Data Type:  REG-DWORD 1
      Value: 1 or 0
  

Note: Set the value to 1 to suppress the generation of delivery receipts. The
default value of 0 allows deliver receipts to be generated.

4. Quit Registry Editor.
