TITLE   :User-mode Programs Cannot Allocate Blocks of Virtual Memory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

User-mode programs are unable to allocate blocks of virtual memory (calls to
VirtualAlloc() do not succeed). This may result in the inability to create
threads, mutexes, critical sections, and so on.


CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when a VirtualAlloc() critical section object is being
called to initialize part of the structure (DebugInfo). VirtualAlloc() reserves
virtual memory on a 64 KB boundary. However, this structure only allocates 4 KB
(reserve and commit) blocks of virtual memory, thereby leaving 60 KB unused.
Over time, this results in fragmentation of virtual memory and may reduce the
size of contiguous blocks available to user-mode programs.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:

STATUS

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0. This problem was
first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5.
