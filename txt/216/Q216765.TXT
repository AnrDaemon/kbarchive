TITLE   :TCP/IP Experiences STOP 0x7F Under Heavy Load
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under high load, a server may experience the following STOP error message:

   0x7F (UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP): 0x0000007f (0x00000008, 0x00000000,
   0x00000000, 0x00000000)

The first parameter, 0x08, indicates that this is a double-fault.

CAUSE
=====

For deferred processing, TCP/IP is calling a function recursively. Under high
load, this recursion can cause a stack overflow.
