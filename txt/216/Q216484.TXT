The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

There are different ways to install applications during the graphical user
interface (GUI) portion of Windows NT 4.0 in a deployment situation. The
Deployment Guide covers using the Cmdlines.txt or the /E parameter, but there is
a third option that can be used in the answer file.

The Deployment Guide is available at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/bin/ntw/depguide.exe

MORE INFORMATION
================

To have a application run during the GUI portion of Setup, such as a service
pack, insert the following parameter into the answer file (Unattend.txt):

      [SetupParams]
      Userexecute="c:\sp4\update.exe"

This assumes that the Service Pack has been downloaded to the distribution share
in the i386\$oem$\c\sp4\ folder. When the unattended installation is started,
Windows NT Setup will then create the directory path and copy the files to the
target computer.

The command on this line runs after the video detection runs. You can run more
than one application by specifying a batch file to be run, and then specify
multiple applications with in it.
