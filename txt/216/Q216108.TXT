TITLE   :Memory Leak and STOP Screens Using Intermediate NDIS Drivers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:_IK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When intermediate (layered) NDIS miniport drivers are in use on Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, you may experience one or both of the
following:

 - A memory leak in kernel nonpaged pool memory. Over time, memory may be
   depleted to the point where system stability is compromised.

 - You may receive the following blue-screen STOP error message with parameters
   that indicate the bad instruction is in the Ndis.sys driver:

   STOP: 0x0000000A (0x00000014, 0x00000002, 0x00000000, 0xFCBA1062)
   IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (* Address fcba1062 has base at fcb95000 - NDIS.SYS)

CAUSE
=====

Intermediate drivers are typically add-ons that layer themselves over hardware
drivers as a filter to provide additional functionality, such as data encryption
or other value-added services. The Ndis.sys driver included in Windows NT 4.0
has been found to have some deficiencies when such intermediate drivers are
used.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT Server 4.0,
Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 4.
