SUMMARY
=======

You can control which users' passwords are synchronized to the UNIX pods by the
Password Synchronization service. This is done by creating and populating the
PasswordPropAllow and PasswordPropDeny local user groups on the Windows NT-based
computer that is running the Password Synchronization service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Password Synchronization service uses the PasswordPropAllow and
PasswordPropDeny groups to determine whether a user's password change should be
propagated to the configured UNIX pods. If a user is in the PasswordPropAllow
group and not in the PasswordPropDeny group, the user's password change is
propagated to the UNIX pods.

By default, the PasswordPropAllow and PasswordPropDeny groups do not exist, and
all users' password changes are propagated. Once one of these groups is created,
password changes are propagated only for those users in the PasswordPropAllow
group and not in the PasswordPropDeny group.

The PasswordPropAllow group should contain users or user groups for which
password changes should be propagated to the UNIX pods.

The PasswordPropDeny group should contain users or user groups for which password
changes should not be propagated to the UNIX pods.
