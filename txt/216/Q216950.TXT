SUMMARY
=======

ODBC Connection Pooling enhances the performance of database connections in
Active Server Pages (ASP) applications. By default, the performance counters for
Connection Pooling are disabled. This article describes the counters and how to
enable them.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To enable the performance counters, follow these steps:

1. Open Control Panel.

2. Double-click the ODBC icon.

3. Click the Connection Pooling tab.

4. In the PerfMon section, select Enable.

5. Click OK.

In Performance Monitor, the following counters will now be listed under the ODBC
Connection Pooling object:

 - Connections Currently Active: The current number of connections being used by
   applications.

 - Connections Currently Free: The current number of connections available for
   connection requests.

 - Connections Sec/Hard: The number of connections made to data sources per
   second.

 - Connections Sec/Soft: The number of connections from the pool per second.

 - Disconnections Sec/Hard: The number of disconnects made to data sources per
   second.

 - Disconnections Sec/Soft: The number of disconnects from the pool per second.
