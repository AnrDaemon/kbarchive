TITLE   :Search Drive Mappings Lost When Using NetWare Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The search drive mappings are lost when running the Novell intraNetWare client
on Windows NT Terminal Server. This problem happens at random, but can usually
be reproduced after logging on three or four times.


CAUSE
=====

There appears to be a race condition between Winlogon and the GINA. Winlogon may
sometimes delete a volatile registry key where the GINA logon script process is
saving information before the process can save the information it wrote to the
key. If this happens, some or all of the logon script information will be lost.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW). Refer to
the Networking supplement guide that comes with the Windows NT 4.0, Terminal
Server Edition documentation for instruction on installing GSNW.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0, Terminal Server
Edition.
