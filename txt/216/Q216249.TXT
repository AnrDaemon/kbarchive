TITLE   :DNS Client Does Not Try All Servers in the DNS Service List
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::2,2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork osr2 win95kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a DNS query and the query returns an error message (such as "Server
failure [rcode 2]"), other servers in the list are not queried. The failure is
passed back to the originator, even though another querying server in the list
could complete the query.

CAUSE
=====

Secondary servers are queried only if no response is received from the primary
server in the server list.

RESOLUTION
==========

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DNS query algorithm has been modified to try other servers in the server
list if an error response is received from a server that could be resolved by
trying another server in the list. The new algorithm retries servers until:

 - The name query is answered successfully
 - An authoritative answer is received from a server that the requested host
   does not exists (rcode 3)
 - The server list is exhausted
