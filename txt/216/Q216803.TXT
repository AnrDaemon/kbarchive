======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 3.0, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Static files that have the hidden attribute set may return an HTTP 404 or an
Access Denied error when browsed, while dynamic files can still be browsed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design.

RESOLUTION
==========

Configuring access control for all Web files should always be implemented
through NTFS permissions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Dynamic files such as Active Server Pages (ASP) or Server-Side Includes (SSI)
are implemented through script-mapped ISAPI extensions, in this case the Asp.dll
and Ssiinc.dll files respectively. These extensions preprocess the executable
code in the files being requested and can therefore read hidden files and return
the expected HTML output to a client. Direct Web browsing of hidden static files
results in a "File not Found" or an "Access Denied" error message.
