SUMMARY
=======

SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2) includes some performance improvements that
result in faster file access when using SNA Server's Shared Folders Gateway
(SFGW) feature.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The internal cache sizes used by the SFGW feature have been increased in SNA
Server 4.0 SP2, which accounts for some of the performance improvements when
accessing AS/400 and S/36 shared folder files.


SNA Server 4.0 SP2 also includes other performance enhancements that benefit all
Advanced Program-to-Program Communications/Common Programming Interface for
Communications (APPC/CPI-C). Because SFGW is an APPC application, it also
benefits from these performance improvements.

For additional information about the other APPC performance enhancements in SNA
Server 4.0 SP2, please see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
