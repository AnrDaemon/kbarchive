TITLE   :Invalid FPNW Parameters May Cause AV in Lsass.exe and Usrmgr.exe
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Lsass.exe and Usrmgr.exe may fail if one or more of the user parameters for the
File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) service are invalid or corrupted.

CAUSE
=====

When FPNW is installed on a domain controller and the "Maintain NetWare
Compatible Login" option is selected in a user's profile, various parameters are
enabled such as Grace Login Limit, Concurrent Connections, among others, for the
user. If any of the parameters become corrupted, both Lsass.exe and Usrmgr.exe
may fail.

Lsass.exe is the service responsible for all domain related functions, such as
user logon validation and user account management. If Lsass.exe fails, all
domain related requests to the server will fail. When an account with corrupted
or invalid data is processed, Lsass.exe may have an access violation or it may
enter an invalid state and be unable to process any requests. A Drwtsn32.log
file will be generated if Lsass.exe has an access violation. When Usrmgr.exe
fails, it will terminate immediately and generate a Drwtsn32.log file.

RESOLUTION
==========
