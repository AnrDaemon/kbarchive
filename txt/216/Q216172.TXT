What are streaming feeds? 

Streaming feeds are a new method of feeding articles between two
news servers over NNTP. Streaming feeds are designed to feed articles more efficiently than standard methods. While streaming feeds are not an official part of the protocol yet, they are widely supported and enable significant performance enhancements.
