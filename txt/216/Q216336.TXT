TITLE   :BUG: ARM Compiler Generates Bad Code for Structure Assignment
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:N\A:2.11; WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbHWARM kbOSWinCE210 kbOSWinCE211 kbDSupport kbGrpDSETK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE 2.10 Enhancement Pack for Windows CE Embedded Toolkit for Visual C++ 5.0, on platform(s):
    - the hardware: StrongArm Processor 
 - Microsoft Windows CE Platform Builder, version 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the hardware: StrongArm Processor 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The ARM compiler for the products listed at the beginning of this article may
generate incorrect code when you use a structure assignment construct. This
problem may occur with or without optimizations enabled.

This problem does not occur when you build ARM programs by using the Platform
Builder version 2.11 Visual Development Environment.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, manually copy the structures by using a memory copy
routine or algorithm.

In Platform Builder, this problem only affects modules that are compiled in the
platform build procedure. The included operating system source code has been
validated with the supplied compiler; however, code that has been added or
modified by a developer to adapt the operating system may encounter this
problem. If the code that experiences the problem is in the ISV layer of the
Microsoft Windows CE operating system model, use the Visual Development
Environment to build the code instead.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

The following code sample generates incorrect code when it is compiled by using
the ARM compiler without optimizations:

   typedef struct { 
      int c [ 36 ]; 
   } myStruct;

   void main()
   {
   	myStruct A, B;
   	A = B;
   }
