MORE INFORMATION

If you raise the error code 40040 (=&H9C68) using the Err.Raise method,
Visual Basic sets the value of Err.Number to 440. The Err.Description and other
properties of the Err object are set correctly.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Visual Basic Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Paste the following code in the General Declarations section of Form1:

   Private Sub Form_Load()
      On Error Resume Next
      Err.Raise 40040
      MsgBox Err.Number & ": " & Err.Description ' will display 440
      Err.Clear ' Clear the error for the next Raise method
      Err.Raise 440
      MsgBox Err.Number & ": " & Err.Description
   End Sub

3. Run the program. A message box with the error number and description raised
   for 40040 will be displayed.

4. Click OK and a message box with the error number and description raised for
   440 will be displayed.
