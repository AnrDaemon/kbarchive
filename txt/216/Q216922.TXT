======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Certificate Server version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

Certificate Server does not create backups of installed keys. If you intend to
use the certificate to encrypt persistent data such as e-mail, then you should
ensure that some form of back up protects the private key for that certificate.
If the key is unprotected, and is subsequently unavailable, then you will be
unable to decrypt data encrypted with the certificate.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The functions of a Certificate Server can be summarized as follows:

    - Receive certificate requests.

 - Create certificates from the requests it receives.

 - Distribute or publish certificates.

 - Publish Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).

Some applications, which encrypt persistent data such as e-mail, have an
additional requirement to archive private keys of encryption certificates. This
is to ensure a users access to the data in the event that they become
unavailable. If that event occurs, the user can request a copy of the private
key from the archive. Exchange Advanced Security has an additional service, the
Key Manager Server (KMS), which performs this role.

Microsoft CSPs store the private keys in the registry. If Roaming profiles are
used, then the Windows NT infrastructure provides resilience for the private
keys. If Roaming profiles are not available, or a third-party CSP is used that
does not use the registry to store keys, separate provisions should be made to
back up the keys.

Additional query words: Certificate, Back-up, S/MIME
