The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), the Microsoft implementation for Web
Based Enterprise Management (WBEM), is an integral component of Systems
Management Server version 2.0.

This article provides a very simplistic introduction to WMI for the Systems
Management Server administrator and defines basic terms and concepts necessary
to know when you manage one or more Systems Management Server sites.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WBEM is a unifying architecture that allows access to data from a variety of
underlying technologies - including Win32, WMI, the Desktop Management Interface
(DMI), and the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). WBEM is based upon the
Common Information Model (CIM) schema, which is an industry standard driven by
the Desktop Management Task Force (DMTF).

The Systems Management Server Site Database, Administrator Console and the Client
Hardware Inventory component all depend on WMI.

WBEM provides a three-tiered approach for collecting and providing management
data. This approach consists of a standard mechanism for storing data (a
CIM-compliant database), a standard protocol for obtaining and disseminating
management data (COM/DCOM; other protocols are also possible and under
investigation), and a Win32 DLL known as a WBEM provider.

CIM and CIMOM
-------------

A component of the CIM (Common Information Model) is the CIMOM (Common
Information Model Object Manager) repository. This datastore is where providers
determine how to retrieve their information.

Although not technically accurate, it helps to think of the CIMOM in terms of a
database. Definitions of WMI terms, and the corresponding concept in database
terminology are in the following list.

   WBEM term    WBEM definition                    Database term
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   Namespace    A collection of all classes.       Database

   Class        Describes datatypes in a
                schema. Object class definition.   Table
   Properties   A single attribute of a class.     Column
   Instance     One object of this class type.     Row
   Value        The data for a property of a       Field
                specific instance.

Providers and WBEM
------------------

A WBEM provider supplies instrumentation data for parts of the CIM schema.
Microsoft has written the WMI provider (a WBEM provider) that interfaces with
the kernel mode WMI component. The kernel mode WMI component provides services
that allow WMI-enabled drivers to implement WMI, and also acts as an interface
to the WMI provider.

Systems Management Server uses the SMS Site Provider as the mechanism between the
SMS Administrator's Console and the site server's SQL database. The Systems
Management Server Hardware Inventory Client component uses the WMI Win32
provider.

The specifications for writing a WBEM provider are available for free, as well as
code examples. Microsoft recommends that an IHV or OEM that manufactures
hardware and software for end users such as a still-image scanner or a printer,
write a WBEM provider. We recommend the IHV or OEM implement the WMI provider
for kernel components.
