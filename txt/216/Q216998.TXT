TITLE   :XWEB: OWA Logon Screen Displays Again When Opening Mail Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Packs 1, 2, 3 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you log on to your mailbox with Outlook Web Access, you may be redirected
back to the OWA Logon Screen when you open a mail message for the first time.

CAUSE
=====

When asked to create new windows through script, Internet Explorer might create
the window in the wrong Internet Explorer process. Because authentication
credentials and the temporary cookies used for session identification are cached
per process, new windows need to re-authenticate and start a new session if they
do not open in the same process as their opening window. This behavior can
appear randomly; the determined process for new windows is dependent on several
variables, including timing and browser configuration.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Outlook Web Access version 5.5,
and Outlook Web Access version 5.5 Service Packs 1 and 2 . This problem was
first corrected in Internet Explorer 4.01 Service Pack 2.
