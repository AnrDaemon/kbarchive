SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install a device from the Windows NT CD-ROM by clicking the Have
Disk button and typing the path to the CD-ROM, you receive the following error
message:

   Setup cannot find Oemsetup.inf. Please type a new path to the Oemsetup.inf
   file.

CAUSE
=====

This message occurs because Setup is looking for an Original Equipment
Manufacturer (OEM) installation (.inf) file, but cannot locate one.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not click the Have Disk button when you are installing a component that
requires the Windows NT CD-ROM. Instead, double-click the component you want to
install, or click it once and then click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Have Disk button is only for the installation of OEM or third-party
components that are not listed by default in Windows NT.
