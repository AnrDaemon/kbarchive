TITLE   :XCLN: Resources Free Busy Information Not Updated
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::8.0,8.01,8.02,8.03; WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 97, versions 8.0, 8.01, 8.02, 8.03 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When setting a resource account (conference room, meeting hall) to use a
delegate to automatically process the meeting requests, the resource account
Free Busy information only shows two months of published data, even though it
has been configured to publish more.

CAUSE
=====

By default, Free Busy information is published for two months, unless otherwise
modified to publish more data. Even though the resource account is set up to
publish more than two months, the resource account is not logged on, and
therefore, the information published to the Free Busy folder is published by the
delegate.

RESOLUTION
==========

The delegate account must also be modified to publish the required amount of
Free Busy information.

WORKAROUND
==========

Set the delegate account to publish more than two months of Free Busy
information.
