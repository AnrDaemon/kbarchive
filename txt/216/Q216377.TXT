TITLE   :XWEB: Exchange Server is Down When Using Address Book Views
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Packs 1, 2, 3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to Outlook Web Access Server (OWA), the following error message
may be displayed:

   Sorry! The Microsoft Exchange Server is down or the HTTP service has been
   disabled by an administrator. Please try your request again later.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by using Address Book Views with the Service account having
search rights at the Organization level.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove Address Book views from the Exchange
Organization, or enable a valid anonymous account in the DS Site Configuration
object. This would normally be the IUSR account created by the Microsoft
Internet Information Service (IIS). Verify that the password set in the DS Site
Configuration object matches the password for this account in User Manager. This
allows the user to log on correctly and see the Address Book view that he or she
belongs to. If the passwords do not match, the above listed errors may occur.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
