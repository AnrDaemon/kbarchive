SYMPTOMS
========

This problem only occurs when using digital signatures and the Encrypt All
functions in Outlook 97.

A message is created and saved prior to sending it to the recipient. After the
message is sent, the text in the body of the message is deleted. There is no
text in the body of the message when the recipient opens the message, and it is
empty in the originator's Sent Items folder as well.

This problem can occur in Outlook 97 when using the Save or Save As commands
prior to sending the message.

WORKAROUND
==========

This problem is resolved in Outlook 98 (8.5.5104.6).
