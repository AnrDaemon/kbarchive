TITLE   :ERROR: Event ID 43: Crash Dump Is Disabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Service Pack 4 for Windows NT 4.0, you may notice the following
in the system event log.

   Event ID 43

   Description: Crash dump is disabled! NT failed to initialize the boot
   partition paging file for crash dump. This may be because the system has more
   than 3.8 gigabytes of physical memory.

CAUSE
=====

This event is recorded when the page file on the system partition is set to a
size smaller than the physical RAM in the computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To keep the error message from appearing in the event log, ensure that the page
file on the system partition is larger than the amount of physical RAM on the
machine.

To change the size of the page file, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click System.

2. On the Performance tab, click Change, and then change the minimum size of the
   page file on the system partition to a value at least the size of physical
   RAM plus 1 MB.

3. Restart the computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Windows NT ecounters an unhandled exception, and is configured in the
Startup/Shutdown tab of the System Control Panel to write a memory dump, Windows
NT will write a memory dump to disk when a STOP error is encountered. Windows NT
will write the dump to the pagefile on the system partition when the STOP error
is encountered, and copy the dump to a file when the system is restarted. For
Windows NT to write the memory dump, the pagefile on the system partition must
be at least as large as the physical memory in the computer.

This event was added in Service Pack 4. Service Pack 4 does not cause this
condition, but merely reports this condition. Prior to Service Pack 4, this
condition was not reported in the System Event Log.

when a STOP error is encountered, please see the following article(s) in the
