TITLE   :SMS: View Troubleshooting Information in Administrator Console
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

All of the data displayed in the SMS Administrator console is provided by the
Systems Management Server Site Provider through Windows Management
Instrumentation (WMI). The SMS Administrator console can be started in Node
Information mode, which displays the source of and all the values behind every
property page available in the user interface.

To operate the Administrator Console in Node Information mode, start the console
with the following command line:

   mmc.exe /sms:NodeInfo=1 D:\sms\bin\i386\sms.msc

   where D is your Systems Management Server installation directory.

This will add an extra property page (tab) called Node Information to every
property sheet.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Node Information property page displays the underlying WMI (Web-Based
Enterprise Management) class with all its properties and instance information,
which is useful for debugging for two reasons:

 - When coding applications using the Systems Management Server Toolkit, it is
   often helpful to use the SMS Administrator console as an example of how
   information can be exposed and manipulated through the Site Provider.

 - One of the properties exposed in the Node Information will be the ID of the
   property's instance. When troubleshooting problems related to collections,
   packages, advertisements, job requests, and so forth, the ID of the instance
   is noted in the log file and sometimes the status message. Since IDs are not
   identified by default in the SMS Administrator console, the Node Information
   property page is the only way to easily identify the the object ID. For
   example, for collections, the it will be called CollectionId.

For additional information on WMI, please refer to the WBEMSDK and the SMS
ToolKit on-line documentation.
