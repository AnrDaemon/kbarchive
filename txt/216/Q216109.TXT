SUMMARY
=======

This article describes steps to troubleshoot MSDN library run-time,
installation, and uninstall problems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are some troubleshooting steps that may fix a number of MSDN
library problems:

1. Before installing the MSDN Library: Make sure there are no programs running
   in the background such as antiviral software. It is also very important for
   all MSDN Libraries to be closed during the installation of a new MSDN
   Library. If not, changes made to HHCOLREG.DAT can be lost and the new MSDN
   Library may not function. It is a good idea to also temporarily remove any
   programs from the Windows Start menu, and then reboot.

2. Rename the Hh.dat file: Exit the MSDN library and then rename the Hh.dat file
   that resides in your Windows\Help directory. Launch the MSDN library. The
   Hh.dat file is re-created every time you rename it and launch MSDN library.

3. Examine the registry: Launch either Regedit.exe or Regedt32.exe and look for
   the following key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\HTML Help Collections\Developer
   Collections\0x0409\0x035efac10

   The 0x035efac10 key is not unique; you will have a different value after
   installation. Make sure that the Filename key has the path set to the proper
   collections file. The collections file takes different file names depending
   on the version of MSDN library; for example, Msdnvs98.col for MSDN 6.0,
   Msdn830.col for MSDN October 1998, and Msdn900.col for MSDN January 1999.

   If the path is not set properly, make the changes and launch MSDN library
   again. Please make sure to exit from MSDN library before making changes to
   the registry.

   If you don't want to modify the keys, then rename the HTML Help Collections
   key, reinstall the MSDN library, and follow the steps in item number 1. If
   the installation is successful, new registry keys will be created.

4. Test the MSDN library installation: The MSDN library is based on HTML Help,
   which depends primarily on two files, Hh.exe and Hhctrl.ocx.

   Open any MSDN file with the .chm extension in Internet Explorer; if the MSDN
   file opens successfully, then Hhctrl.ocx is working properly.

   Hh.exe can be tested by opening a command prompt and going to the
   drive:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\MSDN98\98OCT\1033 directory.

   For MSDN Oct 98, type the following:

   "hh.exe msdn830.col" (without the quotation marks)

   For MSDN 6.0, type:

   "hh.exe msdnvs98.col" (without the quotation marks)

   This should launch the MSDN library. The above path name to the 1033 directory
   may vary depending on the MSDN library installation directory.

   When you get errors involving HTML Help, manually uninstalling and updating
   the HTML Help components should fix the problem.

5. Manually uninstall and then reinstall the MSDN Library.

6. Reinstall the product within which MSDN is being used, such as Visual C++
   6.0:

   MSDN problems may also be caused by an unsuccessful installation of the
   product being used in conjunction with the MSDN library. In such cases, it
   may be possible to launch the MSDN library from the shortcut menu on the
   desktop or from the Start menu on your task bar, but not from the product.

   For example, if you are using Visual C++ 6.0, from the Tools menu, click
   Options and click the Help System tab. Your Preferred Language and Preferred
   Collections fields should not be empty. For example, the Preferred Language
   could be English and Preferred Collections could be MSDN Library - January
   1999 (12/2/98). If these fields are empty, the most likely cause is an
   unsuccessful Visual C++ installation, and therefore you might try
   reinstalling Visual C++ 6.0 and then the MSDN library.

7. MSDN uses the HTML Help technology, which is dependent on Internet Explorer
   technology. There could be situations where MSDN exhibits unexpected
   behavior, due to problems with your Internet Explorer installation. There may
   be situations where you need to uninstall and reinstall Internet Explorer.
   Please see the REFERENCES section below for information on uninstalling and
   reinstalling Internet Explorer.

8. MSDN library Setup may freeze on Windows NT and Windows 95/98.

   If MSDN library Setup.exe freezes, then perform a flat install. In a flat
   install, copy the CD-ROM bits to the hard drive and then run Setup; for a
   typical install, copying CD 1 bits will be sufficient. By specifying
   "setup.exe /G filename" you can create a log file of the setup process.

   If Setup continues to freeze, then restart the computer in VGA mode for
   Windows NT and Safe Mode for Windows 95/98 and rerun Setup. This behavior
   maybe due to the display device drivers or a damaged CD-ROM.

9. If the keywords in the Index tab disappear, then you may want to copy just
   the files with the .chi extension from the MSDN CD-ROM 1 to the hard drive
   location where the MSDN library has been installed (or in other words,
   overwrite the .chi files).

10. Please note that "Favorites" will be lost if another version of MSDN library
   is installed on a computer that already has the library installed. There is
   no way to move the Favorites to newer installations.
