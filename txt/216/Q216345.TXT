TITLE   :Error During SSD 2.10 or Earlier Installation on WinNT 4.0 SP4
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Compaq SSD 2.10 is installed on a computer running Windows NT 4.0 with
Service Pack 4 installed, the following error may appear:

   Installed Service Pack - The Service Pack installed on the system is not
   currently supported on this version of setup. Please consult the help file
   for more details.

This error will only occur if either of the following options are selected during
the SSD installation:

 - HAL and Kernel Upgrade/Downgrade

 - HAL Recovery Option

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because version 2.10 and earlier versions of the Compaq SSD
are not aware of Microsoft's Service Pack 4 for Windows NT. Therefore, to
complete the procedure correctly, HAL and Kernel Upgrade/Downgrade and the HAL
Recovery Option must be performed manually.

RESOLUTION
==========

Compaq is aware of this issue and has posted a workaround solution on its
support Web site at the following URL:
