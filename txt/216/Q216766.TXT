======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a pointer to conformant structure as a field of a complex structure
under Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 4 (SP4), the unmarshaling side gets
uninitialized data. If such a data structure is an [in] parameter, the server
manager routine sees the corruption. If it is an [out] parameter the corruption,
the client sees the corruption.

The same problem appears if your RPC application is running on Windows 95 with
DCOM95 1.2 update or Windows 98 with DCOM98 update as documented in the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q216889 FIX: DCOM95 1.2 or DCOM98 Causes Data Corruption in RPC Calls

Data Structure:

   typedef struct tagConformantStruct 
   {
      unsigned long        size;
      [size_is(size)] char data[];
   } ConformantStruct;

   typedef enum tagColor
   {
      Red, Blue, Green
   } Color;

   typedef union tagMyUnion switch (Color type) u
   {
      case Red :  long  longArm;
      case Blue:  short shortArm;
      case Green: char  charArm;
   } MyUnion;

   typedef struct tagComplexStruct
   {
      unsigned long numUnions;
      ConformantStruct* pConfStruct; // PROBLEM! pointer to conformant struct.
      [size_is(numUnions)] MyUnion myUnions[]; // Makes the struct complex.
   } ComplexStruct;

CAUSE
=====

A defect in the rpcrt4.dll that is shipped with Windows Service Pack 4 (DCOM95
1.2) and DCOM98 prevents the conformant part of the conformant structure to be
marshaled. The unmarshaling side expects the conformant part and unmarshals from
a possibly uninitialized part of the RPC buffer. This causes data corruption.

RESOLUTION
