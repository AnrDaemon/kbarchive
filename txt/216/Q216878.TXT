TITLE   :Macintosh Clients Cannot See WinNT Server After Upgrade to SP4
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Apple Macintosh clients are unable to attach and view files on the Windows NT
Services for Macintosh (SFM) volume. This problem only happens with some network
interface cards (NICs) after Windows NT 4.0 is upgraded to Service Pack 4 (SP4).
The Intel Ether Express 8/16 is one of the NICs that exhibits this problem.
Reverting back to SP3 resolves the problem. And, if there is a Seed Router on
the network, the Windows NT Server computer is able to resolve the media access
control (MAC) address of the Apple client.

CAUSE
=====

Modifications made to Ndis.sys after SP3 broke functionality in Windows NT
Server 4.0, which ignored Apple Macintosh broadcasts.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:
