TITLE   :Windows 95-Based Clients Receive Network Error from Appctl95.exe
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kberrmsg kbnetwork kbtool kbPGC

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Appctl95.exe or try to use your Microsoft Windows 95-based computer
running the Novell Client for Windows with Systems Management Server (SMS)
version 1.2 Service Pack (SP) 4 installed to log on to a Novell NetWare version
3.12 server, you may receive the following error message:

   Program Group Control
   Could not open the application database. There is a network error.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Use the Nadapi95.dll file from the original SMS 1.2 CD-ROM. Obtain the
   Nadapi95.dl_ file from the SMS 1.2 CD-ROM, and then rename it to
   Nadapi95.dll.

2. Copy this file to sms\site.srv\maincfg.box\client.src\x86.bin. This file is
   replicated to all SMS logon servers.

3. Open the System.map file in Notepad, being careful not to modify anything,
   and then save the file. This forces all clients into an upgrade mode so that
   the Nadapi95.dll file is copied to them.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2 SP4.
