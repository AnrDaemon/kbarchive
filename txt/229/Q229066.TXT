TITLE   :PC WRmt: Msrmttr.dll Causes Usgeneric.scr to Return NO ANSWER
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you replace the Msrmttr.dll from the year 2000 (Y2K) patches for MS Mail
Remote for Windows and if you are using the Usgeneric modem script, the modem
may no longer connect and returns a "No Answer" message.

In all cases so far, the failures have occurred when using high speed modems such
as US Robtics/3COM/Megahertz 56K PCMCIA modem cards, IBM X2 PCCard 56K PCMCIA
modems, or IBM ThinkPad internal 56K modems.

CAUSE
=====

The Usgeneric modem script was intended for basic 1200 and 2400 baud modems.

WORKAROUND
==========

The above-mentioned fast modems require specialized scripts written by the modem
manufacturer.

The US Robotics/3COM/Megahertz 56K PCMCIA modem cards and the IBM X2 PCCard
PCMCIA modems have worked correctly with the Ususrhs.scr script available from
3COM's Web site:

   http://www.3com.com/

The IBM ThinkPad internal 56K modems have worked correctly with the Ibmmwave.scr
script file available from IBM's Web site:

   http://www.ibm.com/

MORE INFORMATION
================

Due to various issues involving the combination of different modems, modem
scripts and upgraded DLL files, it may be necessary after upgrading to this DLL
file to change out your modem script. If problems start occurring after you
upgrade to the new DLL file, please contact your modem manufacturer and obtain
their latest modem script. For information about how to contact your modem
