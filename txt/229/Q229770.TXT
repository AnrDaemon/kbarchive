-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you call the CoGetClassObject function for the IClassFactory2 interface on
components that are hosted in a COM+ application, the function fails with error
0x80004002 ("No such interface supported" or E_NOINTERFACE).

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because the class factory wrapper for configured components
only supports the IClassFactory interface, not the IClassFactory2 interface.

Additional query words: 0x80004002
