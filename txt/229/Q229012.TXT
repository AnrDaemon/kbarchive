Terminal Server clients go into a "down" state and cannot be reset.

CAUSE
=====

attempted on the workstation, it stays in a "down" state until the computer is
restarted.

4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you can disable dialog boxes from ever being
displayed. This is done with a registry setting. For additional information,
please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Go to the following key:

     1     If the error does not come from the system, then the system
           continues in normal operating mode. If the error comes from the
           system, then it is written to the system log; no user
           intervention is required and dialog boxes are not displayed.
 
     2     The error is written to the system log; the dialog box is not
           displayed.
