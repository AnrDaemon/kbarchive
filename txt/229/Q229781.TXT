The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to browse a Web resource that has no NTFS file-level
restrictions applied (for example, the Everyone group is granted full control
rights), you may be prompted for a username and password.

CAUSE
=====

You will be prompted for a username and password when you attempt to browse a
Web resource that has no NTFS file-level restrictions applied when there are
share-level restrictions.

When you attempt to access a remote Windows NT resource, most restrictive
permissions apply. Therefore, even though the Everyone group may have full
control at the NTFS file level, share permissions must still be negotiated. For
example, if the \Inetpub\Wwwroot directory is shared and only administrators are
granted access at the share level, only the administrators group will be able to
access the Wwwroot directory of the Web server through a browser on a remote
client.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, set share-level permissions the appropriate level for
the directory that the IIS virtual directory maps to.
