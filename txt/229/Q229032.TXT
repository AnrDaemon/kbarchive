KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

By default, Microsoft Exchange Server versions 4.0, 5.0, and 5.5 are all
installed with the Circular Logging feature enabled. However, you may wish to
disable Circular Logging before installation.

This means that after installation has completed, Circular Logging is already
disabled, providing you with a complete set of Exchange Server transaction log
files since the initial installation of Exchange Server.

For more information regarding Exchange Server transaction log files, and
Circular Logging, please refer to the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

2. Remove the "Read-only" attribute from this newly-copied directory (including
   all files and subdirectories) on your server's hard drive.
