TITLE   :Clients with Different Language Version Replace Printer Settings
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run print servers and their clients in different language versions of
Windows NT (for example, the servers run the English version and the clients run
the German version) with non-postscript printers, a client viewing the printer
settings sees the default settings in the server language.

This may occur even if the user does not have permissions to modify printer
settings and when they do not click OK.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the client detects invalid form and tray names and
changes the server configurations to the default settings.

This behavior is similar to the issue described in the following Microsoft
Knowledge Base article:

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, copy Rasddui.dll from the server computer (in the
server language) to the client computer. For information on how to replace files
that are in use, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

   Q184408 How to Replace In-Use Windows NT System Files

This behavior also occurs when the client connects to the printer and the file is
not present or is an older version. However, when you apply a service pack to
the client computer, this file is overwritten.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The printer settings (for example, tray and form names) are names to identify
the setting. These names are localized to different strings for the various
language versions of Windows NT.
