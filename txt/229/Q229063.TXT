Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

   created by default.

2. From the Project menu, select Components, select Microsoft Windows Common
   Controls-2 6.0, and click OK.

3. Site a MonthView control onto Form1.

4. Add the following code to Form1's code window:

   Private Sub MonthView1_GetDayBold(ByVal StartDate As Date, ByVal Count As Integer, State() As Boolean)
        Dim i As Integer

        i = mvwSunday
        While i < Count
            State(i - 1) = True
            i = i + 7
        Wend
   End Sub

5. Right-click on MonthView Control and view its properties.

6. Set the MonthRows property to 3.

7. Set the MonthColumns property to 4.

8. Click OK to close the MonthView's property page.

9. Press the F5 key to run the project.

   The first month shown will not have its first Sunday in bold. The last month
   will not have any days set bold. All other months will be displayed as
   expected.
