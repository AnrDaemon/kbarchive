SYMPTOMS
========

When Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) opens Microsoft Office files, delays may
occur. The problem generally occurs when you are opening files on NetWare
servers.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because CSNW continually resolves printer names, server
names, and object properties. This results in poor performance. The problem
becomes more pronounced as more and more clients perform the queries.
