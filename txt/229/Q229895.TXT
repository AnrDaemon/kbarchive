TITLE   :Err Msg: Setup Was Unable to Copy the Following File Cdrom.sys
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start an unattended installation of Windows NT 4.0 from an MS-DOS
prompt, you may receive the following error message:

   Setup was unable to copy the following file, cdrom.sys.

Also, in MS-DOS mode you may not be able to create or manipulate any file called
Cdrom.sys.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you load ATAPI Real Mode CD-ROM driver in the
Config.sys file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, edit the Config.sys file. To do this, follow these
steps:

1. At the MS-DOS prompt, type "edit config.sys" (without the quotation marks),
   and then press ENTER.

2. Find the Device= line that contains the ATAPI Real Mode CD-ROM driver.

3. Edit the line so the /D: switch does not contain the word value "cdrom."

For example change the following line from

   Device=<driver> /d:cdrom

to

   Device=<driver> /d:test1

where <driver> is the path and file name of your CD-ROM driver.

Additional query words: msdos cdrom.sys cdrom unattend install nt 4.0
