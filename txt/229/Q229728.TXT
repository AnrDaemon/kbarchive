TITLE   :XCON: Intersite MTA Distribution List Cache Issue
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Distribution List (DL) membership may not be updated correctly across Exchange
Server sites. In other words, after a DL member's mailbox had been deleted (at
Site A, for example), other sites in the Exchange Server organization should not
see the mailbox in the global address list. However, the remote sites may not be
notified of the change to the DL membership. When sending to this DL from one of
these remote sites (for example, Site B), a non-delivery report (NDR) may be
generated by the message transfer agent (MTA) similar to the following:

   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

   Subject: Test MTA DL Cache message
   Sent: 2/1/99 9:25 AM

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

   c=US;a= ;p=ORG;o=SITE;dda:MSXCHNGE=
   //o=ORG//ou=SITE//cn=RECIPIENTS//cn=Deleted user; on 2/1/99 9:25 AM
   The recipient name is not recognized
   MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:SITE:SERVER

CAUSE
=====

The MTA checks the "When Changed" attribute of the DL for updates before every
expansion pass. Implicit deletion of the mailbox (that is, deleting it from a
server, but not from the DL) does not update the "When Changed" attribute of the
DL, even though the mailbox is no longer a member of the DL. The MTA still
recognizes the mailbox is as a member of the DL because the MTA DL cache does
not get updated when a mailbox is deleted, but not manually removed, from the
DL. As such, the Site B MTA DL cache information is not updated because of the
implicit deletion of the mailbox in Site A. Therefore, the Site B MTA continues
to include the deleted mailbox when sending to the DL. Therefore, the Site A MTA
continues to generate an NDR for the deleted mailbox.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English language version of this feature should have the following file
attributes or later:

Component: MTA

+-------------------------+
| File name  | Version    | 
+-------------------------+
| Emsmta.exe | 5.5.2564.0 | 
+-------------------------+



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, recycle the MTA service in Site B.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you apply the fix, the NDR may still occur if someone sends a message to
the DL within 10 minutes of the mailbox being deleted, but after the 10-minute
period, the NDRs will not occur for the deleted mailbox.

For additional information about this problem as it applies to intrasite DL
updates, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
