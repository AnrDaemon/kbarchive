TITLE   :SMS: New Functionality Added to Audit
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms120 kbsms120bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A hotfix for Audit is now available that has three new command-line arguments:

 - /mif

 - /noidmif

 - /notime

Each of these new arguments is described below.

/mif
----

Instructs Audit to use a .mif file name extension instead of the default .nhm
extension. This is useful if you want the Inventory Processor to create
DeltaMIFs rather than the full MIFs created when No History MIFs (NHM) are
processed.

/noidmif
--------

Instructs Audit to create a NOIDMIF called Audit.mif that is placed in the
client's local \Noidmifs directory. Please note that NOIDMIFs are collected by
the Inventory Agents during a full inventory, so the collection of the Audit.mif
will only occur when inventory is taken.

/notime
-------

Instructs Audit to create a MIF that does not report time (that is, only the
file's date is reported). The /notime argument can be used with the default
Audit (NHM) or in conjunction with the /mif and/or /noidmif parameters as well.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

   http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

   Date      Time                Size      File name    Platform

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that contains
the above files may also contain additional files.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, perform the following steps on the Systems Management
Server site server:

1. Replace the Audit32.exe file in the
   <SMS_root>\Primsite.srv\Audit\Package\<Platform>.bin directory
   with the hotfixed version.

2. Replace the Aud32str.dll file in the
   <SMS_root>\Primsite.srv\Audit\Package\<Platform>.bin\00000409
   directory with the hotfixed version.

3. Replace the Audit16.exe file in the
   <SMS_root>\Primsite.srv\Audit\Package\X86.bin directory with the
   hotfixed version.

4. Replace the Auditstr.dll file in the
   <SMS_root>\Primsite.srv\Audit\Package\X86.bin\00000409 directory with
   the hotfixed version.

NOTE: You can perform these steps automatically by using Hotfix.exe with the
provided Hotfix.ini file.

Any previous Audit packages that have been distributed will need to be
refreshed.

WARNING: Before switching from using the default NHM to either a MIF or NOIDMIF,
you should fully understand how each MIF will affect your Systems Management
Server system and database. Please see the Systems Management Server SDK for
more information on MIFs.
