TITLE   :XFOR:GroupWise Dirsync Fails If Directory Synch/Exchange Set to
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Directory synchronization (dirsync) between Novell GroupWise and Exchange Server
may not finish when you request an update from GroupWise to Exchange Server.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise is hardcoded to expect a
full directory list of the GroupWise system as part of the dirsync process.
Entries in the directory list are compared to current entries in Exchange
Server, and any updates or new GroupWise users are subsequently imported into
the Exchange Server directory. Thus, the concept of an update dirsync cycle does
not exist from GroupWise to Exchange Server. However, if the Directory
Synch/Exchange configuration on the API gateway is set to Synchronization, then
the GroupWise Connector cannot ask for a directory list from GroupWise. Instead,
any modifications or additions in GroupWise result in an immediate update sent
to the API_OUT directory. The router for GroupWise automatically processes these
API files as part of its polling cycle.

RESOLUTION
==========

Perform the following steps to check the configuration of the GroupWise API
Gateway:

GroupWise 5.x
-------------

1. Start the NetWare Administrator program.

2. Select the API Gateway object.

3. Select the Optional Gateway Settings tab.

4. Under Directory Synch/Exchange, make sure the Exchange option is selected and
   that the Synchronization and Both options are not selected.

5. Save the changes if any, and restart the API Gateway if needed.

GroupWise 4.x
-------------

1. Start the GroupWise Administrator program (Ad.exe).

2. Select the API Gateway object.

3. On the Action menu, select Edit.

4. Select the Optional Properties tab.

5. Make sure Directory Synchronization is set to No.

6. Make sure that Directory Exchange is set to Yes.

7. Save changes, if any and restart the API Gateway if needed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Connector for
Novell GroupWise.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The GroupWise Connector logs will indicate that the connector is waiting for the
inbound dirsync files from GroupWise. The connector will time out after an hour
and log an error indicating that dirsync was incomplete.
