TITLE   :XFOR: NNTP Does Not Support PULL/POST Feed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 adds an NNTP-Posting-Host header into news
messages posted by news readers who use the POST command.

However, Exchange Server 5.0 and 5.5 reject a news message or posting with an
NNTP-Posting-Host header sent using the POST command.

In the illustration below, a news message posted by a news reader is not sent to
the Exchange Server NNTP host if the NewsFeed setting is configured for a Pull
feed. This is because the Pull feed uses the POST command to send the news
message.

NewsReader-(POST)--> Exchange 5.5 NNTP:PULL--(POST)--X-->Exchange 5.x

--------------------------add a NNTP-Posting-Host------Reject the news message.

The problem is that a Pull/Post feed is being used. This is an ill thought-out
feed type that is NOT supported by Usenet RFCs. The correct feed type is
Push/Accept.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There is no plan to add support for this feed type in Exchange Server 5.5.
