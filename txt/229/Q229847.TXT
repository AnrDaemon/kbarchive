======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual Basic 6.0 does not support 16-bit development. Microsoft has chosen to
dedicate its efforts to the more scalable and higher-performance 32-bit
platform. By focusing the development team on one 32-bit product, we were able
to add many new features to Visual Basic 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual Basic 6.0 can only create 32-bit executable programs. If you need to
develop 16-bit Windows applications with Microsoft Visual Basic, you should
purchase Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0. This product targets both 16- and 32-bit
Windows development and will remain on the market as long there is demand for
16-bit development tools.
