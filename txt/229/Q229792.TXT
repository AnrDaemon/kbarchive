The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The maximum number of elements in an array is limited by the amount of available
system resources. While you could possibly have an array with the maximum 32-bit
value of 2147483648, your program would run out of memory on Windows NT because
Windows NT 4.0 only supports 4GB of memory in a single process.
