TITLE   :XFOR: cc:Mail Migration Fails; PO Name Has Non-AlphaNumeric Char
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to migrate a Lotus cc:Mail Post Office using the Microsoft
Exchange Migration Wizard, messages are not migrated properly and the following
error message is visible in Event Viewer:

   EventID: 1004
   Source: MSExchangeMig
   Description:
   ccMail Export.exe error exporting user 'username' bad parameters on the
   command line. Error with call to the ms-dos version of cc:mailexport.exe. See
   document 'Migrating from lotus ccmail' for more information about Command
   line 'export /P ******** /BATCH /N "username" /Dpath of ccdata directory
   /DATE /1 /files /macbin2 /itemsize /folder /msgs /all /atc:\temp\s5k.2

CAUSE
=====

The Lotus cc:Mail Post Office name contains one or more non-alphanumeric
characters. Microsoft Exchange Migration Wizard uses the name of the Lotus
cc:Mail Post Office when creating a directory to hold migration files. Because
some non-alphanumeric characters are valid under Win32 naming conventions, but
invalid under standard 16-bit naming conventions, Lotus cc:Mail Import.exe and
Export.exe utilities are unable to access the directory created using the Lotus
cc:Mail Post Office name.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Pack 3.
