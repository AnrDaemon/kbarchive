-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Usermode programs may cause Windows NT 4.0, up to and including Service Pack 4,
to experience a kernel-mode STOP error message. This STOP error message is also
known as a bugcheck. The bugcheck code and parameters may vary.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs in some scenarios where the Windows NT kernel does not
verify the parameters passed to it from the usermode program.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server versions 4.0
and 4.0 Service Pack 4. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you apply Service Pack 5, parameters passed from usermode processes should
not cause Windows NT 4.0 to bugcheck.
