======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 3.0, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Active Server Pages 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes syntax differences between the Ad Rotator component
(MSWC.AdRotator) installed with Internet Information Server (IIS) 3.0 and the Ad
Rotator component installed with Internet Information Server 4.0.

The Ad Rotator component displays advertisements and "rotates" different
advertisements every time an Active Server Page is displayed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Ad Rotator component installed with IIS 4.0 changes the way properties are
specified, as well as what values are valid for the TargetFrame property.

The syntax changes from IIS 3.0 to IIS 4.0 are as follows:

 - Changing property setting syntax from Property(value) syntax to Property =
   value syntax

 - Changing TargetFrame values from the frame name (_top) to a name/value pair
   (target=_top)

The following is valid VBScript syntax for the IIS 3.0 version of the Ad Rotator
component:

   <%  
   Set ad = Server.CreateObject("MSWC.AdRotator") 
   ad.Clickable(False)
   ad.Border(0)
   ad.TargetFrame("_top")

   Response.Write ad.GetAdvertisement("/ads/adrot.txt")
   %> 

The following is valid VBScript syntax for the IIS 4.0 version of the Ad Rotator
component:

   <%  
   Set ad = Server.CreateObject("MSWC.AdRotator") 
   ad.Clickable = False
   ad.Border = 0
   ad.TargetFrame = "target=_top"

   Response.Write ad.GetAdvertisement("/ads/adrot.txt")
   %>
