TITLE   :Event Viewer Does Not Sort Events by Date and Time

SUMMARY
=======

The Event Viewer tool (Eventvwr.exe) appears to sort Event log messages by date
and time. These events are actually sorted by the order in which they are
written to the log file and not by the time that they are written. For example,
if an event is logged at 4/4/99 12:00:00pm and the system date is moved back to
1996, the next log entry might read 4/4/96 12:00:30pm. The second event appears
above the first in the log as this is the order in which they are reported. This
may be noticeable in scenarios similar to the following:

 - When you use a time server on a computer that has a fast clock, it may appear
   that events are logged out of order, when in fact, they are logged correctly.

 - When you turn off daylight savings time, events may appear out of sequence.
