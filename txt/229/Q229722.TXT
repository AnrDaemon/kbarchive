PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Index Server version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If German language support is installed for Index Server 2.0 and used to index
German documents containing compound words, the following problem may occur. If
one part of the compound word has an entry in the noise word list of Index
Server 2.0, the queried word is not found in queries.

For example, if the queried word is "Dreiklang," which is composed of "Drei" and
"klang," "Drei" is listed in the German noise word list. Therefore, "Dreiklang"
as a whole is not found. If "Drei" is deleted from the German noise word list,
"Dreiklang" as a whole word is found, but other words like "Dreikanal" are also
found.
