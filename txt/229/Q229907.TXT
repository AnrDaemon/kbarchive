Page 338, Question 70-087.06.07.003:

The NNTP Settings property sheet can be used to limit message size. Therefore,
both optional results are achieved. The correct answer is A.

Change answers A through C to:

Answer A:
"Correct. The proposed solution limits the number of concurrent users to 50,
disconnects idle users after five minutes, and limits the maximum message size
to 64 kilobytes."

Answer B:
"Incorrect. You would receive both optional results. You would receive one
optional result by requiring idle connections to time out after 300 seconds (5
minutes). The default setting is 600 seconds (10 minutes). You would receive the
second option result by using the NNTP Settings property sheet to configure the
maximum message size to 64 kilobytes."

Answer C:
"Incorrect. You would receive both optional results. You would receive one
optional result by requiring idle connections to time out after 300 seconds (5
minutes). The default setting is 600 seconds (10 minutes). You would receive the
second option result by using the NNTP Settings property sheet to configure the
maximum message size to 64 kilobytes."
