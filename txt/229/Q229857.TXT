SUMMARY
=======

When you name a site in Systems Management Server (SMS), ensure that site names
are not duplicated. If you use duplicate site names, problems may occur when you
retrieving information from the database. These problems occur because the site
name is used as part of the key for retrieving data.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you use a duplicate site name, you may notice that computers appear under the
wrong site in SMS Administrator. SMS Administrator uses the site name as part of
the key for finding computers within a site.

When you run a query to retrieve the computers in a specific site, computers may
appear under an incorrect site that has the same site name as the site to which
the computers actually belong.
