TITLE   :Word 97: Security Breach with Word Temp Files, NTFS Permissions
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Temp files created by Word on an NTFS partition during large Copy and Paste
operations do not inherit security attributes from the associated document.

CAUSE
=====

Word does not copy the NTFS file permissions of a document file to the .tmp file
that is created when large blocks of text are copied from the document. The temp
file inherits security from the permissions set on the current directory rather
than the original document file. The .tmp file, which may contain readable text
from the original file, can easily be opened and read by anyone.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem described in this article, obtain and install the latest
Microsoft Word 97 update from the following Microsoft Web site:
