TITLE   :SMS: Remote Administrator Gets "Connection Failed" Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When trying to remotely connect to a Systems Management Site Server that is
fully functional from other machines with equivalent permissions in the same
domain, you may immediately receive the following error message:

   Connection Failed

CAUSE
=====

Further investigation shows that using the
<windir>\system32\wbem\wbemtest.exe utility to connect the Site Server's
repository at \\<server>\root\default with correct permissions can give
the following error message:

   The RPC server is unavailable

This is caused when the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) service is not installed and
started. Verify this by going to Control Panel, clicking Network and selecting
the Services tab. If installed, the RPC Configuration service is listed,
otherwise it can be added from the dialog box by the clicking the Add button.

WORKAROUND
==========

Make sure that the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Service is installed and
functional. Removing and reinstalling the TCP/IP protocol also reinstalls this
service.

If the issue continues to occur, you may be able to resolve the issue by
importing the RPC key from a computer on which this problem does not occur. For
