The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

By default, Web sites use TCP port 80, and FTP sites use port 21. However, other
ports may be assigned to a Web or FTP site.

To specify a non-default TCP port when connecting through a Web browser, add a
colon ( : ) and then the port number (for example
"http://<ComputerName>:<PortNumber>" (without the quotation marks))
to the end of the URL.

To specify the TCP using the Windows NT FTP command line utility, type "ftp"
(without the quotation marks) to start the FTP utility, and then use the "open"
command, followed by a space, and then the port number (for example "open
<ComputerName> <PortNumber>" (without the quotation marks)).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Specifying a Port When Using a Browser
--------------------------------------

If a Web site on the local computer is using the non-default port of 81, type the
following in the Address text box to open it in a browser such as Internet
Explorer:

   http://localhost:81/

Similarly, to open an FTP site that uses the non-default port of 22 from the
browser, perform the following session at a command prompt:

   ftp://localhost:22/

Specifying a Port When Using the FTP Utility
--------------------------------------------

To open an FTP site that uses the non-default port 22, using the FTP utility,
type the following at a command prompt:

   C:\>ftp
   ftp> open localhost 22
