SYMPTOMS
========

You may get one of the following errors while using the Systems Management
Server Administrator console:

   _com_error exception in MMC Admin UI!

   Description: Factory Enumeration Failure
   HRESULT: 0xEEEE0001
   File : E:\opal\mmcadminui\Support\SMS_NMGR\NMGR_NodeData.cpp
   Line: 221

   Description: Error enumerating (select * from SMS_Site where ReportingSiteCode
   = "DMX")
   HRESULT : 0x80041001
   File: E:\opal\mmcadminui\Support\SMS_NWBM\NWBM_CWbemAsyncNodeFactory.cpp
   Line: 346

-or-

   Description: CWbemAsyncNodeFactory::Enumerate Failed

   Query : select Name, Icon, PackageID, SourceSite, Manufacturer, Version,
   Language from SMS_Package where ActionInProgress!=3

   HRESULT : 0x80010108-The object invoked has disconnected from its clients.
   File: E:\opal\mmcadminui\Support\SMS_NWBM\NWBM_CWbemAsyncNodeFactory.cpp
   Line: 107
   Entry Point : Child node factory error

Additionally, the dialog box also defines the build as SMS 2.0 Beta (1239).

NOTE: You may receive a different "_com_error execption" error from the ones that
are specifically listed in this article.

CAUSE
=====

Although these error messages appear to be problems with the Administrator
console or Microsoft Management Console (MMC), investigation has only shown
these messages to appear where there are genuine connectivity or site system
problems.

WORKAROUND
==========

Below are two examples that you can use as clues in troubleshooting these errors
and preventing the error messages:

 - The Line 346 error may occur if an Administrator console is connected to a
   remote SQL Server database and the SQLExecutive and MSSQLServer services are
   stopped. An attempt to refresh at certain levels will cause this error.

 - The Line 107 error may occur if the Administrator console is connected to a
   remote SQL Server database and the SQL Server hard disk partition fails.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
