The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0SP1, 3.0SP2, 3.0SP3, 4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following System Event may be logged on the SNA Server computer when
printing with the SnaPrint Service:

   Event ID: 20
   Source: Print

   Description:
   Printer Driver [printer driver name] was added or updated. Files: [list of
   updated files]

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Event 20 message could be caused by the following events that take place
when printing with the SnaPrint Service:

 - If the drivers for a remote printer are not installed on the SNA Server
   computer, the Windows NT spooler service will copy the drivers locally in
   order to print.

 - If the drivers for the remote printer ARE installed on the SNA Server
   computer, the spooler service still checks the remote printer server for
   updated drivers. If the drivers are newer than the ones installed on SNA
   Server, then the newer ones are temporarily copied locally to print the job.

These events occur for every print job that is sent through an SNA Server print
session. The message does not cause any problems with printing, and can be
considered an informational message.
