TITLE   :XFOR: InterOrg Fails to Replicate Public Folder
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The new feature of Exchange Server, the InterOrg Public Folder Replication tool,
can replicate information between different organizations. However, the Japanese
version of InterOrg fails to replicate public folders when a folder name is in
double-byte character set (DBCS) and contains the character code "0x5c".
InterOrg returns the error 0x800b0001.

CAUSE
=====

"0x5c", backslash, (0x5c\) is used as a folder separator on InterOrg and
InterOrg is not DBCS-aware.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The Japanese version of this fix should have the following file attributes or

+-------------------------+


STATUS

version 5.5 Service Pack 2. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server
5.5 Service Pack 3.
