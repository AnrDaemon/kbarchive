SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Resource accounts and delegates, you cannot check the availability
of attendees for a scheduled meeting from within the Resource Calendar.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The attendee list that you see when opening a meeting request is built from the
recipients of the message. The To recipients of the message are considered the
"Required" attendees and the Cc recipients are the "Optional" attendees.

In the case of the delegate, meeting requests are forwarded by a server rule from
the resource mailbox to the delegate mailbox. As with any forwarded message, the
original recipients of the message are not retained, so that information is
lost. Outlook 97 avoided this by storing the names of the original recipients in
the meeting request, and these names are displayed in the meeting attendee list.
However in Outlook 98, the delegate receives only the attendee names and not all
the information normally available for a message recipient, so the delegate is
unable to look up the attendees' free/busy times.
