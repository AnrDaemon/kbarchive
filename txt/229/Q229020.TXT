PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbYear2000 kbvfp600 kbvfp600bug kbXBase kbVS600sp3fix kbGrpDSFox

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You have a Visual FoxPro application written using @ GET commands. You have
issued a SET CENTURY OFF command in your application code. If you use an @ GET
referring to a date variable or field, the year portion of the date might
display incorrectly when the @ GET does not have focus. Note that the underlying
data is unaffected, only the display may be incorrect.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.

For more information about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code from a program (.PRG) file:

   CLEAR
   SET CENTURY OFF
   dDate = {^1999/04/05}
   cString = "Another GET"
   @ 1,1 GET dDate SIZE 1,10 FONT "Courier New",10
   @ 3,1 GET cString FONT "Courier New",10
   READ CYCLE

2. Tab between the two @ GETs. The year value in the first @GET will be 1999
   when it has focus and 2019 when the focus moves to the second @ GET.

3. Type 01/01/01 in the date field, and then press Tab a few times. The year
   value of first @ GET will be 2001 when it has focus and the year value will
   be 2020 when the second @ GET has focus.

4. If you monitor the value of dDate in the Debugger Locals window while tabbing
   between the two @GETS, you will see its value remains unchanged although the
   display does change.
