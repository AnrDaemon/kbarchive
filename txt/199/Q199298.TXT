SYMPTOMS
========

If a delegate copies a calendar locally that is owned by another user, the
delegate can view details of the calendar owner's private appointments and
meetings.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Outlook client is designed to filter appointments that are marked private,
so that only the intended creator or recipient can view a private appointment in
the calendar. This filtering process prevents delegates from viewing the
contents of private items that are intended for the original creator or
recipient only. After a delegate copies the calendar, the Outlook client ignores
this sensitivity property, and the private items in the calendar are displayed
for the delegate.
