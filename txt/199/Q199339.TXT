TITLE   :XFOR: Chat Server Join Command to Multiple Channels Doesn't Work
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Exchange Chat Server, when you place a space within a list of
channels to be joined by a single join command, the following message appears:

   475:Cannot join channel (+k)

None of the channels listed in the join command will be joined. The expected
behavior is that the channels up to the space character are joined and all
channels following the space are ignored.

WORKAROUND
==========

Remove the space from the join command.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Chat Server.
