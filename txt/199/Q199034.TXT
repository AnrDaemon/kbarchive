PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms120 kbsms120bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Remote Control cannot connect to a client if the 3Com network interface card
(NIC) utility is run and an error occurs.

If you have connection problems with remote control and decide to use the 3Com
utility to run tests on the network card, the client computer will become
unreachable to a request for future remote control sessions.

This behavior can be quite confusing. You were able to remote control the client
before the utility was run, but not after. The client has most of its network
functionality back after the utility has been shut down; remote control is not
available.

CAUSE
=====

The 3Com utility holds the remote control port open and does not let it go until
the compputer is restarted.

WORKAROUND
==========

Restart the client computer to regain remote control functionality.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.2 and 2.0. This problem will not be corrected.
