TITLE   :XFOR: POP3 Reply Address Contains Numerous Invalid Addresses
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you reply to a message sent from a POP3 client, the To field in the reply
message may contain numerous recipient addresses. These address may be invalid
but contain the proper SMTP format such as
<user_name>@<domain_name>.com. However, the reply address does not
contain the original POP3 sender address.

CAUSE
=====

The POP3 sender has placed incorrect information, such as the user's residential
address, in the Reply-to-address option in the POP3 client configuration.

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify that the POP3 user has placed the proper e-mail address in the
Reply-to-address option in the POP3 client configuration. To verify this
information, on the Tools menu, click Accounts, click the Mail tab, select the
account, and then click Properties. On the General tab there is a place to enter
a reply address. This is the address that is creating a problem. If the POP3
user has any question about what this value should be, he or she should contact
his or her Internet service provider (ISP), or administrator. Removing the
address should not create delivery problems.
