TITLE   :SBS 4.5 Setup Lists Incorrect Space Required for Other Drives
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server version 4.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Setup of Small Business Server (SBS) 4.5 will allow certain applications to be
installed on drives other than the system partition. The space required to
install all applications on the system partition is displayed correctly.
Selecting an application and choosing another partition, however, will indicate
that the space required for all programs is 0.

CAUSE
=====

The space required for all programs to install is indicated by the drive
currently selected. If a second drive is selected, but no applications are
selected to install on that drive yet, the correct amount of disk space would be
0.

RESOLUTION
==========

Select an application to install on the additional drive.
