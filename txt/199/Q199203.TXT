TITLE   :XFOR:Problems Rescheduling Meetings Between Exchange and Notes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Exchange Notes Connector (Web Drop 2) does not currently send rescheduled
meeting requests from Exchange Server to Lotus Notes properly. This results in
an error in the Notes client.

CAUSE
=====

This is because of a conflict with duplicate meeting IDs in Notes. Although
meetings can be rescheduled in Outlook, the changes are not correctly propagated
to Notes, resulting in a matching ID error at each Notes recipient.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Notes Connector will be redesigned to take this conflict into account.

STATUS
======

Microsoft confirms this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.5.

Additional query words: reschedule, meetings, error, matching ID
