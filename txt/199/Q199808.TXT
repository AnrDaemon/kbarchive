TITLE   :SMS: Browsing PGC Shares from Win95 or Win98 May Not Be Accurate
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms120 kbPGC

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When viewing a Systems Management Server distribution server containing shared
applications from within Network Neighborhood, client computers running
Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98 may see the contents of a different
Systems Management Server distribution server.

This does not happen when viewing a drive mapped to the same server.

CAUSE
=====

When client computers running Windows 95 or Windows 98 are configured to use
Program Group Control (PGC), Nnp.exe redirects requests for shares listed in the
Network Applications Database (NAD) to the first available distribution server
in the NAD list. The servers in the NAD are stored in alphabetical order.

This became evident when placing user-specific files on a distribution server
local to a group of users. When the users attempted to locate these files, they
were not there. The files were placed below a share managed by the NAD.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Remove Nnp.exe from the SMS Naming Network Provider in the Windows 95 or
   Windows 98 Startup registry key
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices

   NOTE: This step may cause the Windows 95 or Windows 98 Program Group Control
   applications to fail if they cannot connect to the specified distribution
   server listed in the program shortcut.

   -or-

 - Create separate packages and user groups for each distribution server. Create
   a Systems Management Server program group for each package and user group
   combination. This will assign a dedicated distribution server to the user
   group, preventing the rerouting to a different server.

   NOTE: This option becomes very difficult to administer as the number of
   packages and distribution servers grows.
