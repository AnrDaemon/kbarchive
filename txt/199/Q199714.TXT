SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message is displayed when you attempt to add a computer
running Windows NT to the domain:

   Unable to connect to the domain controller for this domain. Either
   the username or password entered is incorrect.

The error message is displayed even though networking is enabled and the correct
administrator name and password credentials were supplied.

CAUSE
=====

SMB Signing has been enabled and set to required. SMB is also known as the
Common Internet File System (CIFS) file sharing protocol.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

There are two different ways of resolving this problem:

Option 1:

Temporarily disable SMB Signing on the PDC.

NOTE: This option is required to get a backup domain controller (BDC)
successfully added to the domain.

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

   System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanManServer\Parameters

3. Set the following value to 0:

   Name: RequireSecuritySignature
   Type: REG_DWORD
   Value: 0 (disable), 1 (enable)

   NOTE: The default is 0 (disable)

4. Click OK and then quit Registry Editor.

5. Shut down and restart Windows NT.

Option 2:

Temporarily join a workgroup, and then enable SMB Signing on the member server or
workstation prior to joining the domain.

NOTE: Windows NT Workstation Service Pack 3 or later has SMB Signing enabled by
default. Windows NT Server has SMB Signing disabled by default.

To re-enable SMB Signing on a computer running Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Service
Pack 3 or later:

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

   \System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Rdr\Parameters

3. Click Add Value on the Edit menu.

4. Modify the following value:

   Value Name: EnableSecuritySignature
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Data: 1

   NOTE: The default is 1 (enable)

5. Click OK and then quit Registry Editor.

6. Shut down and restart Windows NT.

To enable SMB Signing on a computer running Windows NT Server Service Pack 3 or
later:

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

   System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanManServer\Parameters

3. Set the following value to 1:

   Name: EnableSecuritySignature
   Type: REG_DWORD
   Value: 1

   NOTE: The default is 0 (disable)

4. Click OK and then quit Registry Editor.

5. Shut down and restart Windows NT.
