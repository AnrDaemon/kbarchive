TITLE   :BUG: Expansion of __LINE__ Macro Is Incorrect When Using /ZI
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCompiler kbVC600bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++.NET (2002) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The results of the __LINE__ macro are incorrect when you use Debug Information
for Edit and Continue (/ZI). The problem may manifest itself as compiler,
linker, or run-time errors.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use the Program Database option (/Zi) instead of
Edit and Continue (/ZI).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample code demonstrates the problem:

      // TEST.CPP - Compile with /GX and /Zi or /ZI.
      #include <iostream>
      using namespace std;

      #define CONCAT(s1,s2) #s1 ## #s2
      #define MSG(n) cout << CONCAT(Message at line\x20,n) << endl;

      int main()
      {
      MSG(__LINE__);
      return 0;
      }

When compiled with the /Zi option, output is correct:

   Message at line 10

When compiled with the /ZI option, output is incorrect:

   Message at line (__LINE__Var+1)
