TITLE   :XFOR: Tentative Schedule in Outlook Appears as Free in Notes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

There is an option to tentatively schedule appointments in Outlook. When this
information is passed through the Calendar Connector to Lotus Notes, it will
appear as free time. End users in Notes may be confused by this, and it may
result in conflicts with meeting times and other calendar entries with Exchange
Server users.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is by design because Outlook marks all tentative time slots as free time.
The Calendar Connector is correctly sending the result of the F/B query back to
Lotus Notes.

Additional query words: tentative times, outlook
