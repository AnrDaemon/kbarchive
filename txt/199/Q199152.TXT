PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows desktop icons may not be correctly displayed on the desktop. In some
cases, the icons may be displayed as black or possibly in other colors.
Ultimately, the icons do not appear as advertised.

Deleting and re-creating the shortcuts does not fix the problem. Newly created
shortcuts are also affected by the problem. Non-shortcut icons such as My
Computer, Recycle Bin, and folders are unaffected by this problem.

CAUSE
=====

The reason that the icons are displayed incorrectly may be related to the use of
TweakUI in conjunction with Internet Explorer 4.0. This occurs because of
corruption in the Icon Cache file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To ensure that the icons are displayed correctly, complete the following steps.

1. Uninstall TweakUI from the system (if installed).

2. Open Start Menu, Settings, Control Panel, then click the Display icon.

3. Select the Appearance tab.

4. Select the icon in the Item Box.

5. Increase the icon unit by 1.

6. Select Apply.

7. Decrease the icon unit by 1.

8. Select OK.


1. Delete the file %systemroot%\ShellIconCache Note: This file has a hidden
   attribute.

2. Log off and log back on to see the correct icons.
