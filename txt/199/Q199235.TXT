SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 now includes support for Novell
NDS and Bindery emulation.

Recently, Novell has introduced its own version of the Internet Protocol TCP/IP.
Microsoft's Systems Management Server is not designed with network connectivity
using Novell's version of TCP/IP.

It is not recommended that this protocol be used because Systems Management
Server systems will become unstable and functionality may be greatly hampered.

Microsoft has not done any testing of TCP/IP other than its own for support and
use with the Systems Management Server product. Microsoft Systems Management
Server has not been tested and will not be supported under this configuration.
