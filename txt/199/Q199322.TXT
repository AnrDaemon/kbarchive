TITLE   :PRB: OEM to ANSI Translation Fails While Creating New DSN
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER::3.5,3.6

KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbODBC kbSQLServ kbGrpDSVCDB kbGrpDSMDAC kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server, versions 3.5, 3.6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When creating a new data source (DSN), the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC driver
(Sqlsrv32.dll) offers the following four translation options:

 - Let SQL Server ODBC driver choose the translation method.

 - Do not perform character set translation.

 - Perform OEM to ANSI translation.

 - Use the ODBC translator.

You get the correct translation if you either select to let the driver choose the
translation method or select the option to use the ODBC translator and specify
the correct code page translator yourself. However, if you select the option to
perform OEM to ANSI translation, no translation occurs. This is the same effect
as if you had selected the option not to perform character set translation.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem and duplicate the behavior of the OEM to ANSI
translation option from previous drivers, you must specify the OEM code page of
the client, not the server. To do this, select the option to use the ODBC
translator and manually select the correct code page translator. For example,
for U.S. English Windows clients, you would use code page 437.
