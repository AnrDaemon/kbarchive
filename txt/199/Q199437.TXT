SYMPTOMS
========

A graphic saved as the EnvelopeExtra1 AutoText entry may be superimposed over
the return address text.

CAUSE
=====

The address frame is set with an exact vertical size. When you use the
EnvelopeExtra1 AutoText entry to insert a graphic, the entry causes
repositioning of the return address text if the graphic is too large. This
causes the text to disappear or be repositioned so that it is not visible. The
large graphic pushes the line spacing down in the address frame. Because the
address frame is formatted with an exact vertical size, Word must crop the
return address.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use a smaller graphic so Word does not reposition
the return address.
