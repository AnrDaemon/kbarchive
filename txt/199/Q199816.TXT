TITLE   :SMS: Manually Stopped Threads of the SMSEXEC Service Autostart
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

SUMMARY
=======

SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER is the service that restarts the threads of
SMS_EXECUTIVE. If SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER is running, it restarts the stopped
threads when it executes a polling cycle. By default, the polling cycle occurs
every hour.

MORE INFORMATION
================

As part of the polling cycle, SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER also restarts the
server-side services, such as SMS_EXECUTIVE itself and SMS_SQL_MONITOR. Note,
however, that nothing polls and restarts SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER. Therefore,
if the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER is manually stoped, it must be manually
restarted, or it will be automatically started after a server restarts.

Additional query words: prodsms services threads re-start re-boot reboot start stop sms smssvr
