TITLE   :XFOR: SSL Connection to NNTP May Result in Unstable Store
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbExchange500preSP3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

The Information Store service may not shut down gracefully if the Internet News
Service has been configured for Secure Socket Layer (SSL) security.

CAUSE
=====

When users attempt to connect to the Exchange news server through SSL, they may
timeout during a connection. Afterwards, any attempts to stop and restart the
Information Store service will result in continuous attempts by the service to
shut down without any success.

RESOLUTION
==========

This is an information store bug specific to Exchange Server 5.0 only. This will
not affect the Exchange Server 5.5 Information Store service.

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Exchange Server 5.0 service pack that contains this fix.
