SYMPTOMS
========

In Outlook Web Access (OWA), if you are using a custom form and click on the
Attachments tab during a check names query, nothing will happen. The same
operation in the stock form will take you to the Attachments tab.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you click on the Send icon to access check names, it will work just fine. It
is only when you click on the Check Names icon to access it that you will
experience this behavior.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
