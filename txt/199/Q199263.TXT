The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

The "Remove software when it is no longer advertised" option allows programs to
be automatically uninstalled when the program is no longer advertised to a
client. This option is only available to programs that register through Control
Panel (double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon). This option is set on the
Advanced tab of Program properties. To set this option, the administrator must
provide the name of the Uninstall registry key created by the application during
installation. Note that this registry key is not necessarily the same string you
see in the actual Add/Remove Programs dialog box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Advertisements are considered no longer advertised when a client is no longer a
member of the target collection, the advertisement is deleted, or the
advertisement expires.

To determine when software is no longer adverstised to a client, Advertised
Programs Monitor (APM) keeps a list of known advertisements and the next time
this list is successfully read from the client access point (CAP), APM evaluates
the two lists to determine which advertisments may be eligible for this option.
Note that all advertisements to a client for a particular program must be
removed before APM will attempt to uninstall.

Programs that register through Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel do so by
adding a new key to the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall registry
key. This key contains the values that Add/Remove Programs uses to perform
uninstallation. Specifically, the UninstallString and/or QuietUninstallString
values contain the appropriate commands to start the uninstallation of the
program. These values can be up to 127 characters in length. When APM checks the
given registry key, it first looks for the QuietUninstallString value and then
the UninstallString value.

Additional query words: deinstall apm installer prodsms
