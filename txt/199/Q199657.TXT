TITLE   :SMS: 1.2 and 2.0 Site Server Cannot Share SQL Server on 1.2 Site
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbsms200 kbsms120

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A System Management Server 1.2 site using a SQL Server that is installed on the
same computer, cannot also host a Systems Management Server 2.0 database. The
System Management Server 1.2 site server will not recognize the SMS_SQL_Monitor
service from the Systems Management Server 2.0 site as a valid component and the
service will be removed from the registry.

The SMS_SQL_Monitor service is a component that monitors the Systems Management
Server 2.0 site database on a SQL Server computer for changes and notifies
related components when a change occurs. When an event occurs, SQL Monitor
either writes a file to the related Systems Management Server inbox or notifies
the component by named pipe. SMS_SQL_Monitor is also responsible for executing
periodic database maintenance. The SMS_SQL_Monitor includes two threads:

 - Trigger Monitor notifies Systems Management Server components, such as
   discovery data manager (DDM), when database events have occurred.

 - Task Manager runs scheduled database maintenance tasks.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SQL Server is used to store and manage the site database. SQL Server can be
installed on a separate computer running Windows NT Server. If SQL Server is
installed on a computer other than the version 1.2 site server, SQL Server can
be used for the site databases for a mix of version 1.2 and version 2.0 sites.
This SQL Server can also be a client to the version 2.0 site, as well as a full
participant in any Systems Management Server 2.0 component server roles, as long
as version 1.2 uses it only for its database storage.
