TITLE   :SMS: Assigning Class and Instance Security Rights
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bugkbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

By assigning object Class and Instance rights, it is possible to customize the
view your administrators have of the SMS Administrator console.

However, when using the Security Rights Properties console item to assign user
Class or Instance security, only one class or instance can be modified at a
time. After security is assigned to the current user or user group, clicking
Apply causes the dialog box to become grayed out and no additional changes can
be made.

To assign additional Class or Instance security rights, you must do the
following:

1. Navigate to the Security Rights node in the Systems Management Server
   console.

2. Right-click, point to New, and then click Class or Instance Security Right on
   the shortcut menu.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem and assign multiple Class and Instance security
rights to users or user groups, use the Manage SMS Users Wizard. To start the
wizard, perform the following steps:

1. In the SMS Administrator console, navigate to the Security Rights node.

2. Right-click, point to All Tasks and then click Manage SMS Users. This starts
   the Manage SMS Users Wizard.

With the wizard, you can modify or remove an existing user or user group, and add
a new user or user group. You can also copy the permissions of an existing user
or user group. This allows the creation of template users, which simplifies
security because permissions need only be set up once.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
