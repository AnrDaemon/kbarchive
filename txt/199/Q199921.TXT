TITLE   :SMS: Disk Serial Number Inventories as FFFF-FFFF
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbInventory smsinv smsdatabase

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Some Microsoft Windows NT client NTFS hard drive partitions may have their
Serial Number property incorrectly inventoried as FFFF-FFFF. This can happen if
the user account does not have at least List permissions to the partition. This
can also occur on Microsoft Windows NT clients if the Systems Management Server
Inventory Agent service account does not have at least List permissions to the
NTFS partition.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs because the user context under which the Inventory Agent is
running does not have adequate permissions to gather the Serial Number
properties of the hard drive partition.

WORKAROUND
==========

Ensure that the user account and Systems Management Server Service Account have
at least List permissions to all NTFS partitions that need to have Serial Number
information included in inventory.
