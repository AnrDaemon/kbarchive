TITLE   :Duplicate Datakeys in Table After Datdupck Runs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbsms120 kbDataLoader kbsmsUtil

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Datdupck.exe and Datdupcl.exe utilities are used to resolve problems with
duplicate datakeys in an SMS database. The table that results might contain new
duplicate datakeys even after Datdupcl.exe has deleted the previous duplicates.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may be caused by a value in the NextSpecificKey in the GROUPMAP
table of less than (and therefore overlapping) the current maximum value in the
table that shows the problem.

For example, you might discover new duplicates and see an entry in the
Datdupck.log such as:

   11766 Duplicate datakeys found in Table: IRQ_Table_SPEC

(Note that the table name might be different.)

Running the following queries with a utility such as ISQL/w may show this
overlapping range of datakeys:

   Select MAX(datakey) from IRQ_TABLE_SPEC
   Select NextSpecificKey from GROUPMAP where SPECIFICTABLENAME =
   'IRQ_Table_Spec'

For example, say the first select query returns a value of 2017976 and the second
query returns a value of 2009726. This means that the next new record in the
IRQ_TABLE_SPEC will have a datakey of 2009726. The problem is that you already
have datakeys in the table up to and including the value 2017976. Thus, until
the NextSpecificKey value is incremented to a value greater than the current
maximum value in your table, you will continue to assign duplicates.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Systems Management Server version
1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Duplicate datakeys can cause performance problems, which may result in a backlog
of Management Information Format files.
