SYMPTOMS
========

If, for an undetermined reason, there is no existing record in the
WorkstationStatus table when dataloader attempts to load a MIF, the MIF will be
moved to the Badmifs directory. The following appears in the datalodr.log: (This
example shows SQL tracing enabled.)

WORKAROUND
==========

Two options are available to work around this problem:

 - The badmifs exhibiting this particular problem can be moved back to the
   process directory. Dataloader will process them correctly the second time.

 - The badmifs exhibiting this particular behavior could be deleted (the
   information will be lost), and the next inventory cycle should process
   properly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
