TITLE   :SMS: What Is CHECK20?
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbsms200kbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Check20.exe is an executable file that is included in Systems Management Server
1.2 Service Pack 4 to allow interoperability between version 1.2 and 2.0 clients
in a multi-site environment. Check20.exe is referenced in the Runsms.bat and
Smsls.bat files.

One reason for this change to the Systems Management Server logon scripts was to
prevent the 1.2 client code from overwriting client files installed by a 2.0
site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The purpose of Check20.exe is to determine what type of discovery and/or
installation has taken place on the client. When run, Check20.exe will return an
ErrorLevel that determines what action to take on the client.

Check20.exe reads the "Number of Opal Installations" value from the SMS MultiBoot
Configuration section of the %Windir%\Smscfg.ini file to determine what
ErrorLevel to return, according to the following rules:

 - If "Number of Opal Installations" is greater than 0, Check20.exe returns
   MS-DOS ErrorLevel 0.

 - If "Number of Opal Installations" is 0, Check20.exe returns MS-DOS ErrorLevel
   2.

 - If "Number of Opal Installations" value does not exist, or if Smscfg.ini does
   not exist, Check20.exe returns MS-DOS ErrorLevel 1.

The following table describes the ErrorLevels:

ErrorLevel     Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

ErrorLevel 0   Systems Management Server 2.0 has determined this 
               computer is assigned to one or more Systems Management
               Server 2.0 sites.

ErrorLevel 1   Systems Management Server 2.0 has not yet reached this
               resource with an installation method to determine if this
               computer should be assigned to one or more Systems
               Management Server 2.0 sites.

ErrorLevel 2   Systems Management Server 2.0 has evaluated this computer
               one or more times and determined that it is NOT assigned to 
               any Systems Management Server 2.0 site participating in that 
               particular installation method (at the time of 
               determination).

ErrorLevel 3   Unknown Error

The Systems Management Server 1.2 "Opal Interop" script (which assumes that the
2.0 script is also running during this logon) will skip processing the 1.2
script if Check20.exe returns an ErrorLevel of 0 or 1, giving the 2.0 script a
chance to set the value to 0 or 2.

The 1.2 "Opal Aware" script (which assumes that the 2.0 script is not running
during the logon attempt, although 2.0 clients may be encountered in the
enterprise) will skip processing the 1.2 script only if Check20.exe returns a 0
or a 1.
