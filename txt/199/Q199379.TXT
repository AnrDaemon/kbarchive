TITLE   :XADM: Event 7000 :The System Cannot Find the File Specified
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When joining an existing Exchange Server site, the administrator may encounter
the following error message:

   The system cannot find the file specified...0XC0020002

The administrator will find Event-ID 7000 in System Event Log.

Installation to a new site completes successfully.

CAUSE
=====

The existing servers in this site have installed a third-party proxy DLL (for
example, Csproxy.dll). During Setup (Join existing Site), this DLL is not copied
over to the new server (as it is supposed to be, according to SDK
recommendations), and therefore, the System Attendant fails to start.

WORKAROUND
==========

Possible workarounds to this problem are as follows:

 - Copy the needed file manually to the new Exchange Server computer during the
   installation process. Compare the file with an existing file on another
   server to determine the file location.

   -or-

 - This should be the preferred option if more than one server has to be
   installed.

   1. Create a network installation share.

   2. Copy the third-party proxy DLL into the required directory or directories.

   3. Adapt the Server.inf file to enable the Exchange Server Setup to copy the
      proxy DLL to the needed directory locations. To do so, in the Server.inf
      file, add an entry for the third-party DLL to the section [Proxy Files].
