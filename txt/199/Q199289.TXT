TITLE   :XFOR: Migration Wizard or CCMC Crashes on Alpha NT for JPN
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you are migrating from Lotus cc:Mail to Microsoft Exchange Server and are
running the Lotus cc:Mail Migration Wizard on a fast Alpha server, you might
encounter the following error message:

   A memory error occured.

After you click OK, you are returned to the Migration Wizard screen. It may or
may not allow you to continue the migration process, but if it does, no users
will be migrated.

CAUSE
=====

The cc:Mail Migration Wizard relies on the Lotus 16-bit application Export.exe
for migrating messages. When Export.exe starts up, it causes the Windows NT
Virtual DOS Machine (NTVDM) to intialize itself. During this initialization,
this error can be encountered. It is due to a problem with three
terminate-and-stay-resident (TSRs) files that are inherent in the Config.nt file
on Japanese versions of Windows NT for Alpha. The three TSR files are:

Kkcfunc.sys
Msimek.sys
Msimei.sys

These TSRs are required only when customers need to input Kanji characters from
the user interface of 16-bit applications into the Windows NT environment. Note
that this problem will occur for any 16-bit application because they all require
the Windows NT Virtual DOS Machine.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem will be addressed in the next service pack of Windows NT 4.0.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem do either of the following:

 - Remove or comment out the three TSR files before you run any 16-bit
   application, such as the cc:Mail Migration Wizard.

   -or-

 - Wait for the next service pack for Windows NT 4.0

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problems has been reproduced on both Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 and
Service Pack 4. It is possible that this problem may occur in an earlier build
of Windows NT 4.0.
