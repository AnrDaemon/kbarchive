PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to add a new application mapping in Internet Information Server
4.0 or you edit an existing mapping that contains a space in the file path, the
Microsoft Management Console (MMC) returns the following error:

   You must enter a valid path.

CAUSE
=====

The path in the Internet Information Server application mapping contains a
space.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, do not use spaces in the path to the executable file
in the application mapping. Instead use the 8.3 translation for the path. For
example, the path to c:\Program Files\Our Application\sample.dll should be
entered as c:\progra~1\ourapp~1\sample.dll.
