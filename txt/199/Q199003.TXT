TITLE   :PRB: Visual InterDev Permissions for Users Who Are Not Local Adm
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,5.0,6.0; winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe500 kbSSafe600 kbVisID _IK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual InterDev, versions 1.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When trying to open an existing Web project in Visual InterDev, the following
dialog box may appear:

   Title: Name and Password Required:

   Web Application:
   /<project name>

   UserName: <Domain name>\<Username>
   Password:

CAUSE
=====

The directory permissions on the IIS server are not being inherited correctly
from the root Web.

RESOLUTION
==========

Go into the project as a Local Admin in Visual InterDev and change the project
to "use unique permissions" and assign users permission. This ensures that
permissions are set on the sub Web correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem can happen when permissions used by the FrontPage Server Extensions
are misconfigured. To reset permission on an entire Web structure, you should
remove the IUSR_<machinename> account and the Everyone group from any
access on the entire Web directory structure, use the "check and fix" feature in
the FrontPage Server Administrator, and then add "Everyone has Browse Access"
back to the project (if appropriate) in the Web Permissions dialog box of either
Visual InterDev or FrontPage.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Web project from Visual InterDev 1.0 or 6.0.

2. Add files to the project.

3. Add the project to Visual SourceSafe.

4. Close the project.

5. Using Visual InterDev, connect to the existing project as a user that is not
   a Local Admin. As the project is connecting, the dialog box described above
   appears.
