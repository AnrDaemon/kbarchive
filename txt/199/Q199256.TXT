The Student.doc file, contained on the Supplemental Course Material CD-ROM, shows
revision marks when opened in WordPad. These revisions marks do not appear if
the file is opened in Microsoft Word 97.

If you would like to receive a copy of this file that does not show revision
marks when opened in WordPad, please email tkinput@microsoft.com.


Page 230: Table Incorrect

On page 230 of the "Acaademic Learning Series Networking Essentials, Second

In the "Demand Priority" column and the "Type of access method" row, change:

Page 777: Description of Gateway Incorrect

the level of functionality varies widely between different types of gateways."
