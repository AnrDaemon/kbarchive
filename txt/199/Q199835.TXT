TITLE   :ERD Recovery Process Halted - Insert Compaq SSD in Drive A
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you restore system files by using the emergency repair disk (ERD) that has
been run on a Compaq system on which Compaq Support Software Disks (SSDs) have
been applied prior to running RDISK, you may receive the following message:

   Insert Compaq NT Support Software Disk into Drive A:

There is not an option to redirect the location in which to find the file or
files in question. If you insert a Compaq Support Software Disk (SSD) into drive
a, the message still occurs and the files cannot be located.

The ERD process is trapped in a loop and the only option at the time is to
prematurely end system recovery.

CAUSE
=====

During the installation and upgrade of Compaq SSDs, the Setup.log file is
annotated. In most cases, the Netflx3.sys line is as follows:

   \WINNT4\System32\drivers\NetFlx3.sys="netflx3.sys","13604","\","Compaq NT
   Support Software Disk",""

If the Compaq Management CD, which contains the Compaq Insights Agents, has been
applied, the Sysmgmt.sys argument has been changed as described below:

   \WINNT4\System32\Drivers\Sysmgmt.sys="SYSMGMT.SYS","21008","\SYSMGMT","Compaq
   Support Software 1.20 for Microsoft Windows NT(TM), Diskette #1","CPQNTSSD"

NOTE: The above lines should be continuous and have been wrapped for readability.
Also, there can be additional lines that also include "Compaq Support
Software..."

After you apply the Compaq SSD and then run RDISK, the Setup.log file on the ERD
will be annotated with the changes.

Unfortunately, there is not a corresponding .inf file for the drivers. After the
ERD recovery process parses the Setup.log, it prompts for a Compaq Windows NT
Support Software Disk; however, the information needed to install the drivers
does not exist.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, follow these steps:

1. Delete or remark the following lines in the Setup.log file and then save
   changes:

   \WINNT4\System32\drivers\NetFlx3.SYS="netflx3.sys","13604","\","Compaq NT
   Support Software Disk",""

   \WINNT4\System32\Drivers\Sysmgmt.sys="SYSMGMT.SYS","21008","\SYSMGMT","Compaq
   Support Software 1.20 for Microsoft Windows NT(TM), Diskette #1","CPQNTSSD"

2. Remove the hidden, system, and read-only attributes on the Setup.log file on
   the ERD (either at a command prompt using "attrib -r -h -s" (without the
   quotation marks) or through Windows NT Explorer).

3. Go through the ERD restore process again; it should complete successfully.

To resolve this problem in the future, you can edit the Setup.log file on the
local hard drive of the system in question. The Setup.log file resides on
%systemroot%\WINNT\repair and also has the hidden, system, and read-only
attributes.
