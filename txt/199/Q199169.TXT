======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A secondary site may be showing system status messages for NetWare components
unable to start due to the Intranetware Client not being installed on the
server.

CAUSE
=====

During a secondary site install from a Primary site server that contains NetWare
components, the NetWare options are transferred to the secondary site and the
threads for NetWare are automatically started. This is a problem if that
secondary site was never meant to work with any NetWare servers.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the secondary site will have NetWare resources configured as system roles,
then applying the Intranetware client to the server should stop the system
status messages from being created.

If the NetWare components are not needed on this secondary site, then uninstall
the secondary site and reinstall using the CD Installation method. This method
allows you to not select the NetWare components during the reinstallation.

NOTE: Running the setup program at the secondary site that is producing the
status messages shows you the checkboxes for the NetWare components. However,
these components are unable to be deselected and removed as they are dimmed and
unavailable. Uninstallation and reinstallation of the secondary site through the
CD method without enabling the NetWare components is the recommended method to
unable them.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
