TITLE   :XFOR:IMS Ignores MIME Settings for Specific Domains
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Administrators may configure different MIME settings for specific e-mail domains
in the Internet Mail Service properties by clicking the Internet Mail tab. Prior
to Exchange Server 5.0 (that is, Exchange Server 4.0), all messages that were
rerouted to those domains reflected the target domain's settings on the Internet
Mail Service or Internet Mail Connector. Exchange Server 5.0 and Exchange Server
5.5 no longer behave in this manner.

CAUSE
=====

Both Exchange Server 5.0 and 5.5 now preserves message fidelity. If an SMTP
message came in to the Internet Mail Service as MIME and is rerouted to another
SMTP domain, the original message's encoding type takes precedence over any
settings for that target domain. However, if a message originated from Exchange
Server for that target domain, it would inherit the encoding settings configured
by the administrator.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0, 5.0, and 5.5 for Windows NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although this problem can be seen in Exchange Server versions 5.0 and 5.5, the
root of the problem is Exchange Server 4.0 retaining the MIME settings.
