SUMMARY
=======

To use a static PowerPC library in a Visual C++ Macintosh application, the
library must first be converted to a CFM (Code Fragment Manager) Shared Library
using a native PowerPC Macintosh development environment. The shared library can
then be ported, and linked dynamically. For additional information, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q145822 DOC: Creating Import Libraries for PowerPC Shared Libraries

MORE INFORMATION
================

Many Macintosh libraries are delivered as static libraries. There are a number
of proprietary formats for 68K static libraries. MPW (Macintosh Programmers
Workshop) libraries, usually named with a ".o" extension, are the most common
and most interchangeable format. These can be converted to Visual C++ static
libraries using MPW2LIB.

PowerPC static libraries cannot be converted using MPW2LIB. PowerPC static
libraries must first be converted to shared libraries using a Macintosh
development environment other than Visual C++.

In general, a static library can be converted to a shared library by:

1. Creating a new shared library that includes the static library.

2. Exporting the static library's symbols.

The specifics of this process depend on the Macintosh development environment
used.

Once a shared library has been created it can be used by Visual C++. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
