TITLE   :XADM: Server Monitor Services Not Unique Between Many Monitors
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5

SUMMARY
=======

When you create multiple server monitors for the same server, you cannot specify
different sets of services for each monitor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is by design. Every server has one list of services monitored by all server
monitors monitoring that particular server. If you go to the Server tab of a
server monitor and choose the Services button, you can configure the set of
services that you want monitored by any server monitor monitoring that server.
The user interface (UI) on the server monitor simply provides a view of
monitored services and a quick way of changing the list of services for all
monitors monitoring that server.
