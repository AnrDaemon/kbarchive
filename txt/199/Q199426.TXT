PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbClient kbsms120 kbsms120bug kbInventory kbsmsAdmin

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When inventory is taken for OS/2 clients, the values for Base, Extended, and
Total Physical memory may report an incorrect value or a value of <null>.
Manually running the OS/2 utility Os2mem32.exe also reports the amount of memory
incorrectly.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the computer system's BIOS does not support the OS/2
compatibility mode for memory usage.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correctly report memory inventory you must upgrade the system BIOS to a
version that supports OS/2 compatibility mode.
