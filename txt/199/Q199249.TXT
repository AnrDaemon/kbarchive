-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When setting up a Systems Management Server 2.0 primary site server, you are
prompted to configure the maximum number of user connections for your SQL
Server. This article describes how the setup program determines the default
number of connections and how you can change this setting after the Systems
Management Server site server is installed.

Systems Management Server 2.0 requires 50 user connections for the use of the
site server and the Systems Management Server services that run on the server
plus 5 user connections for each SMS Administrator console that will run
concurrently.

When you set up Systems Management Server, the setup program calculates the
number of connections based on the number of SMS Administrator consoles you
specify. For example, if you configure Systems Management Server setup with 5
Administrator consoles, setup configures 75 user connections:

   50 connections for the server

   + 25 connections for SMS Administrator consoles (5 connections * 5 consoles)

   -----------------------------------------

   = 75 User Connections

This formula produces an estimate of the number of connections required. The SMS
Administrator console uses SQL Server connections based on the number of
connections needed to retrieve the data requested by the user. For most users, 5
connections should be sufficient but the number of connections you require might
vary.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you find that you have an insufficient number of user connections available,
you can increase the number using SQL Enterprise Manager or ISQL/w.

To add user connections using SQL Enterprise Manager:

1. Expand the server group, right-click your SQL Server, and then click
   Configure on the shortcut menu.

2. On the Configuration tab, change the number of User Connections specified.

3. Restart MSSQLServer service using either the Control Panel or SQL Service
   Manager.

To add user connections using ISQL/w:

1. Load ISQL/w and click the Query tab.

2. In the Query window, type and execute the following queries

   

   sp_configure "User Connections", X
   reconfigure

   where x is the number of user connections you want to configure. You can
   execute these queries seperately or together; to run them together, add "GO"
   on the line following "reconfigure".
