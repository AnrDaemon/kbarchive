Known Limitations
Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes
When adding non-Lotus Notes users to a Lotus Notes Name and Address Book (for
example, users with Internet, X.400, or cc:Mail addresses), you must specify a
user name and a domain name. While Lotus Notes does not require this
information, the connector uses it when propagating directory information to
Microsoft Exchange Server. Specify the domain to which the connector is
attached.
