This article contains comments, corrections, and information about known errors
relating to the Microsoft Press book Inside Microsoft SQL Server 6.5, ISBN
1-57231-331-5.

The following topics are covered:

 - Page 84, Figure 3-3: Nonclustered Index Should Be Indid > 1

 - Page 85, Figure 3-4: Clustered Index Should Be Indid = 1

 - Page 228: cust_id should be set to NOT NULL

 - Page 303: Last line in query not necessary

MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 84, Figure 3-3: Nonclustered Index Should Be Indid > 1
-----------------------------------------------------------

Page 84, figure 3-3:
A representation of a non-clustered index in sysindexes should be indid >1.

Change: indid = 0

To: indid > 1


Page 85, Figure 3-4: Clustered Index Should Be Indid = 1
--------------------------------------------------------

Page 85, figure 3-4: A representation of the clustered index in sysindexes should
be indid=1.

Change: indid = 0

To: indid = 1


Page 228: cust_id should be set to NOT NULL
-------------------------------------------

On page 228, cust_id field is specified as IDENTITY, and should not be set to
NULL. It should be NOT NULL.

Change:

   CREATE TABLE customer 
   ( 
   cust_id smallint IDENTITY(100, 20) NULL, 
   cust_name varchar(50) NOT NULL, 
   ) 

To:

   CREATE TABLE customer 
   ( 
   cust_id smallint IDENTITY(100, 20) NOT NULL, 
   cust_name varchar(50) NOT NULL, 
   ) 


Page 303: Last line in query not necessary
------------------------------------------

On page 303, under "Correlated Subqueries", the last line in the example query is
not necessary, and deleting the last line will not change the results of the
query.

This example can also be written:

   SELECT T.title_id, title
   FROM titles T
   WHERE PRICE <= 19.99
   and T.title_id IN (
   SELECT S.title_id FROM sales S, stores ST
   WHERE S.stor_id=ST.stor_id
   AND ST.state='CA' AND S.qty*T.price > 250
