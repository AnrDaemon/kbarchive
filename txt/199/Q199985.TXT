KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbDatabase kbsms120

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a Systems Management Server 1.2 site server, the Windows NT Event Viewer and
the Systems Management Server Events window both display the following error
message:

   Event ID: 320

   The job encountered an error trying to execute a query and therefore cannot
   generate the list of target workstations for the job. Possible causes are:
   SQL Server is not available; or a fatal low memory condition was encountered.

As a result of this error, new Systems Management Server jobs remain pending and
don't go active.

CAUSE
=====

The tempdb database does not have Select Into/Bulk Copy enabled.

WORKAROUND
==========

To enable Select Into/Bulk Copy and resolve the problem, follow this procedure:

1. Open SQL Enterprise Manager and register the server, if necessary.

2. Expand the server tree and then expand the Databases folder.

3. Right click tempdb and then click Edit.

4. Click the Options tab and select the Select Into/Bulk Copy check box if it is
   not already selected.
