TITLE   :XADM:  ESE Will not Retry Operations during ESEUTIL /G
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

When the Exchange Database Engine encounters a read verification failure,
referred to as an -1018 error, (in accordance with Knowledge Base article
Q151789, XADM: Error -1018 (JET_errReadVerifyFailure)), it will now retry to
successfully read the page a maximum of 16 times. This is a new feature of the
Exchange Database Engine, referred to as "ESE," and was introduced in build
5.5.2395.0 of Ese.dll.

However, when using ESEUTIL to perform an Integrity Check (ESEUTIL /G), retry
operations are not performed if the Exchange Database Engine encounters a read
verification failure. If ESE retries to read the page it originally failed on
(when running either Repair or Integrity Check), the length of time to run
ESEUTIL increases dramatically.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Retry operations will occur when running ESEUTIL in either Repair (/P) or
Integrity Check (/G) modes using a build of Ese.dll between 5.5.2395.0 and (but
not including) 5.5.2416.0.

However, because Ese.dll build 5.5.2416.0 retry operations are not performed if
the Exchange Database Engine encounters a read verification failure during
ESEUTIL in either Repair (/P) or Integrity Check (/G) modes, this version of
Ese.dll is included with Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2.

For additional information about the retry functionality in Ese.dll, please see
