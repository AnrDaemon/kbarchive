======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When NET TIME is sent as a package and the package is set to "run with
administrative rights," NET TIME will not be able to connect to another domain.

The Administrative account in this context only runs with local machine rights
and does not have domain rights.

To work around this behavior, do one of the following:

 - Create a Windows NT Client Software Installation account in the SMS Admin UI
   (under Site Heirarchy\Component Configuration\Software Distribution) that has
   Domain user rights to perform the net time.

   -or-

 - Use the Local Domain in the net time command.
