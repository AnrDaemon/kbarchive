SYMPTOMS

When you create a new application root for the default Web site in IIS, the
application, once called "Default Application," is now blank. Please notice that
in this scenario, the application path will still be populated with data (for
example, <Default Application>).

WORKAROUND
==========

Click inside the Application Name box and type the friendly name that you want
for this application (you can simply keep calling it default if you prefer).
Click the OK button to save the change.
