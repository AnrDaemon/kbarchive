SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to install ATI Rage Pro (AGP) drivers during an
unattended installation of Windows NT 4.0. Support for AGP video cards was not
included in Windows NT until the release of Service Pack 3, so the following
steps outline the method by which these drivers can be properly installed during
an unattended installation.

1. Determine which multiprocessor HAL your computer requires using the following
   list:

    - Halast.dll = "AST Manhattan SMP"
    - Halsp.dll = "Compaq SystemPro Multiprocessor or 100% Compatible"
    - Halcbus.dll = "Corollary C-bus Architecture"
    - Halmca.dll = "IBM PS/2 or other Micro Channel-based PC"
    - Halmpsm.dll = "Micro Channel Multi Processor PC"
    - Halapic.dll = "MPS Uniprocessor PC"
    - Halmps.dll = "MPS Multiprocessor PC"
    - Halncr.dll = "NCR System 3000 Model 3360/3450/3550"
    - Haloli.dll = "Olivetti LSX5030/40"
    - Hal.dll = "Standard PC" (single processor HAL)
    - Hal486c.dll = "Standard PC with C-Step i486"
    - Halwyse7.dll = "Wyse Series 7000i Model 740MP/760MP"

2. Rename hal*.dll to hal*.old in the sharepoint where the Windows NT setup
   files are located.

3. Copy hal*.dll from Service Pack 3 or later to the sharepoint where the
   Windows NT setup files are located. The Hardware Abstraction Layer (hal.dll)
   is the file that must be updated for proper functionality of AGP video
   cards.

   Microsoft Knowledge Base:

4. Assuming the Windows NT setup files are in a folder called I386, create a
   folder under the sharepoint called I386\$OEM$. Under I386\$OEM$, create a
   folder called Display. Place the OEM video drivers for the Rage Pro card in
   the I386\$OEM$\Display folder.

5. Place the following information in the [Display] section of your Unattend.txt
   file. Make proper adjustments to the BitsPerPel, Resolution, and Refresh
   settings as applicable.

         [Display]
         InfFile = "ati.inf"
         InfOption = "ATI Technologies Inc. 3D RAGE PRO"
         BitsPerPel = 8
         XResolution = 640
         YResolution = 480
         VRefresh = 60
         AutoConfirm = 1
         InstallDriver = 1

NOTE: The information below needs to be verified with the version of driver you
are using. In particular, verify that the name of the INF file inluded with your
drivers is Ati.inf, or change the line below to reflect the correct name of your
INF file. Also, the InfOption must match the description of the driver. The
easiest way to verify this setting is to view the following registry entry on a
computer that has the Rage Pro card properly installed:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\ati
   \Device0"Device Description"="ATI Technologies Inc. 3D RAGE PRO"

At this point, the unattended installation is ready to run.
