SYMPTOMS
========

A VXD built in Visual C++ version 5.0 or later, may fail to load in the Windows
95 or Windows 98 operating system if it contains constant data.

The same VXD built with Visual C++ version 4.2 may not show this behavior.

CAUSE
=====

The problem stems from differences in the way the compiler versions handle
constant data. The 4.2 compiler erroneously grouped constant data with all other
data. Hence, all data appeared in the LDATA section in the object.

Later compilers, starting with version 5.0, correctly treat constant data as
separate read only data and place it in the .rdata section. Because of this, the
VXD fails to load, unable to recognize the new section.

The Visual C++ .NET Linker issues an LNK4212 warning for this condition.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use any one of the following two workarounds:

 - Add the following pragma in the source file where constant data is declared:

       #pragma const_seg("_LDATA")

 - Add the following linker switch:

       /merge:.rdata=_LDATA

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
