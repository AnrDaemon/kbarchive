TITLE   :PRB: User-Defined onexit/atexit/cexit Not Called If /MD or /MDd
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:4.0,4.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbHWMAC kbVC kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, Macintosh Cross-Development Addon, versions 4.0, 4.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

User-defined onexit, atexit, and cexit routines are not called for PowerMac
applications using the C run-time dynamic-link library (DLL), /MD or /MDd.

CAUSE
=====

DLLs and applications have different arrays of onexit pointers. The Win32
libraries have a method for ensuring both arrays are run through when the
application terminates; however, this was not put in place for PowerMac DLLs.

Also, note that special handling is required for user-built DLLs!

RESOLUTION
==========

Following are some possible ways to resolve this problem:

 - Use the static version instead of the DLL version of the C run-time
   libraries.

 - Clean up in the destructor of a global C++ object.

Additional query words: _cexit cexit _onexit
