TITLE   :XFOR: GroupWise/Lotus Notes DXA Slow to Respond to Full Reload
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2; winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - LinkAge Message Exchange, version 3.2 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Immediately after starting the Lotus Notes/GroupWise connector, administrators
may find that performing a Full Reload on the connector will result in a delayed
response of up to two minutes. It will appear as if the Directory Exchange Agent
(DXA) had not yet received the directory synchronization (dirsync) request.

CAUSE
=====

The directory synchronization notification design of the DXA is based on polling
changes to the Pcta.tbl file. When the DXA is starting up, it may miss the
polling interval to check for changes to the Pcta.tbl file. When this happens,
it has to wait until the next scheduled polling interval (approximately a
minute) before attempting to check for new dirsync requests.

RESOLUTION
==========

Wait a minute or two before attempting to manually schedule a full dirsync
request on the connector. If a full dirsync is attempted immediately after the
connector starts up, simply wait for the response from the connector. Do not
attempt to issue any more requests to the DXA.

STATUS
======

Microsoft acknowledges this to be a problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The design of the directory synchronization component in the GroupWise connector
is based on former connectors, such as the Lotus Notes connector. This problem
will also affect the older LinkAge 3.2 connectors.

Additional query words: slow response; full reload
