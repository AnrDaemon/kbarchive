Microsoft scanned this file for viruses. Microsoft used the most current
virus-detection software that was available on the date that the file was
posted. The file is stored on secure servers that prevent any unauthorized
changes to the file.

By default, the stock font property for an MFC ActiveX control is persisted as a
binary COM object (IFontDisp). Many Web authoring tools expect to deal with
properties as text name/value pairs using the IPersistPropertyBag interface.

These samples demonstrate how to persist the stock font as a set of text
properties to enable the control to be used by Web authoring tools such as
FrontPage and the ActiveX Control Pad.

A sample HTML file is provided that demonstrates how to access the font
properties from a Web page.
