TITLE   :XADM: Service Pack Update Fails on Exchange Standard Edition
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Standard Edition on one of the
nodes participating in a Microsoft Cluster Server Configuration, you will not be
able to install any Exchange Server 5.5 service pack.

This affects all servers with Microsoft Exchange Server not using the Cluster
option but running on one cluster node in the cluster.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if you install Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Standard
Edition on a computer that you later upgrade to form a cluster by upgrading the
operating system to Windows NT 4.0 Enterprise Edition and Microsoft Cluster
Server.

The update executable file for Exchange Server 5.5 service packs is
cluster-aware, so the update program will see that Exchange Server is not
properly installed in the cluster environment and will fail.

WORKAROUND
==========

This is by design. If you want to run Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 on a
cluster, you must install the Enterprise Edition of Microsoft Exchange Server
5.5.
