TITLE   :XFOR: IMS Message Counts in  Admin. Not Reflected in Queues
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you view the message count and message resources for the Internet Mail
Service in the Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Administrator program, you find
counts of messages existing in the Internet Mail Service mailbox of the
information store. Viewing the Internet Mail Service queues, you do not see any
messages in any of the queues. If you use the Mdbvue32 tool included on the
Exchange Server 5.5 CD, you find no messages in the Internet Mail Service
mailbox in the information store.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem has been reported to the Microsoft development team and feedback
shows that this anomaly results from optimization of gateway mailbox queues.
These message counts can be safely ignored. Moreover, you can choose to run the
Isinteg utility to recalculate the real message count and message resources for
the Internet Mail Service.

Additional query words: imc resources mdbview mdbvu
