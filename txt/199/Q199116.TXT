KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbInventorykbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Software Inventory in Systems Management Server version 2.0 will scan only for
file extensions that are defined in the user interface (UI), not for a specific
file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you need to query for and find a specific file, the extension for that file
must be defined in the Systems Management Server 2.0 UI. After inventory is
taken and all of the files with the defined extension are found, you can run a
query on the inventoried files to find the specific file you need.

Additional query words: prodsms SWIinv32
