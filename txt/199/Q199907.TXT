SUMMARY
=======

The MSDN library documentation for the Evaluate method of the Debugger object
incorrectly states that this method is functionally identical to typing in the
Visual C++ debugger's Watch window. For example, the Watch window can evaluate
C/C++ function calls and the Evaluate method cannot.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Launch the MSDN library and follow this path:

   

   Visual C++ documentation
  Using Visual C++
    Visual C++ User's Guide
      Automating Tasks in Visual Studio
        Developer Studio Objects
          Reference: Developer Studio Objects
            Objects
              Debugger Object

Click Evaluate. The documentation states the following:

   

   Evaluates an expression, as if you typed it in the Visual C++ debugger's Watch window.

This is incorrect. Debugger.Evaluate cannot evaluate functions during a debug
session of C/C++ code in Visual C++. However, Debugger.Evaluate can evaluate
such mathematical expressions as "2+2".
