TITLE   :XIMS: Link Monitor Setup Fails with Two NDRs on Notes Connector
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you set up a link monitor to a foreign system, you can send a ping message
to a mailbox that doesn't exist. A mail message with an invalid address will
make it across the connector into the foreign system where it is rejected as an
invalid address and returned to the Exchange Server address of the sender. In
the case of the Notes Connector, the sender's address will be the Notes address
of the Exchange Server System Attendant.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The first non-delivery report (NDR) in this case is normal. If, however, the
Exchange Server computer sends an NDR in reply to the original NDR, the problem
lies with the Notes address of the System Attendant.

To verify the System Attendant's e-mail addresses perform the following:

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.

2. Open the Exchange Server's Mailbox Resources under the server's Private
   Information Store object.

3. Double-click the System Attendant mailbox.

4. Select the E-mail Addresses tab, and verify that the Notes address is
   correct, (for example, it has no extra spaces).
