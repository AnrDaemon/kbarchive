SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to package and deploy Internet
Information Server (IIS) applications by using the Microsoft Visual Basic
Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW). The PDW packages your .dll file and its
dependencies into a cabinet (.cab) file. The .cab file can then be deployed to a
Web server where the files can be unpacked, installed, and registered.

NOTE: HTML and Active Server Pages (ASP) pages are not packaged in the .cab file,
but they are copied to the appropriate location when the application is
deployed.

Use the PDW to Create the Package
---------------------------------

To create a package for an IIS application, follow these steps:

1. Load the application project file in Visual Basic, and then start the PDW
   from the Add-Ins menu.

NOTE: If the PDW is not on the Add-Ins menu, add it from the Add-In Manager,
which is located on the Add-Ins menu.

2. On the main PDW page, click to select Package.

NOTE: You may receive the following message:

   To proceed, the wizard requires the executable file '[project name].dll' for
   this project. Click Browse to find the file or Compile to compile the
   project.

If the application has been recently compiled, click to select Browse to find the
compiled .dll. Otherwise, click to select Compile.

3. On the Package Type page, for IIS applications, click to select Internet
   Package, and then click Next.

4. On the Package Folder page, by default, the package is assembled in a
   directory under the project directory named Package. If you want the package
   to be placed in a different directory, type the file path in the Package
   Folder text box, and then click Next. Otherwise, just click Next.

5. The Included Files page lists all of the files that will be placed in the
   .cab file. The default listed items are Mswcrun.dll (WebClass Runtime),
   Visual Basic 6 Runtime, OLE Automation files, and your IIS application .dll
   file. If you want any additional files added to the .cab, click Add, and then
   locate the file to add. When you are finished, click Next to continue.

   NOTE: You may experience problems when you deploy your package if you include
   the WebClass Runtime, the Visual Basic Runtime, or the OLE Automation files.

the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   RInstallApplicationFiles of INF File filename.INF are Busy'

6. Click Finish and the PDW completes the packaging of the IIS application. All
   selected settings are stored in a script. If the package must be re-created
   in the future, this script can be selected to automate the packaging process.

Deploy the Package to IIS
-------------------------

After the application has been packaged, it can be deployed to a Web server. The
Web server must have Posting Acceptor 2.0 installed for the PDW to function
properly. For additional information about the Posting Acceptor, click the
article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q192116 HOWTO: Configure Posting Acceptor To Work With the PDW

Additionally, IIS applications must be deployed to an existing virtual directory
on the Web server.


Follow these steps to deploy the package to the Web server:

1. On the main PDW page, click to select Deploy.

2. On the Package to Deploy page, click to select the package you want to
   deploy, and then click Next. The package is referred to in the list box by
   the script name that was selected in the last page of the packaging steps.

3. On the Deployment Method page, click to select Web Publishing, and then click
   Next. Packages can be published to a Web server or to local or network
   folder.

4. The Items to Deploy page prompts you for items to deploy to the Web server.
   By default, this includes the cabinet package and any ASP, HTML, or other
   files that are in the application project. Click to clear any files that you
   do not want to deploy to the server, and then click Next.

5. On the Additional Items to Deploy page, click to select any additional files
   to be deployed that were not part of the project, and then click Next. Note
   that these additional files must either be in the project directory or in one
   of the subdirectories of the project directory.

6. On the Web Publishing Site page, type the URL to where the package is to be
   deployed. The package can be deployed by either HTTP Post or File Transfer
   Protocol (FTP). For additional information about how to use FTP to deploy
   Visual Basic Internet applications, click the article number below to view
   the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q192639 HOWTO: Use PDW to Deploy Using the FTP Web Publishing Method

   NOTE: For a package to be deployed by HTTP Post, the Web server must be
   configured with the Posting Acceptor 2.0. There is also an option here for
   unpacking and installing the server-side .cab file. This option can only be
   used with HTTP Post. Click Next to continue. You may receive the following
   message:

   The specified URL and publishing protocol can be saved in the registry as a
   Web publishing site. This will verify that the URL and publishing protocol
   are valid and will save time for future deployments to this site. Do you want
   to store this information as a Web publishing site?

Click Yes if you want to save this information in the registry. Otherwise, click
No to continue.

7. Click Finish and the PDW completes the deployment of your application.
   Similar to when packaging applications, the selected settings are stored in a
   script so that any future deployments for the current application can be
   automated.

Deploy the Package to a Local or Network Folder
-----------------------------------------------

Follow these steps to deploy the package to a local or network folder:

1. On the main PDW page, click to select Deploy.

2. For Package to Deploy, click to select the package that you want to deploy,
   and then click Next. The package is referred to in the list box by the script
   name that was selected in the last page of the packaging steps.

3. For Deployment Method, click to select Folder, and then click Next. Packages
   can be published to a Web server or to a local or network folder.

4. For Folder, use the Browse button to locate the local or network folder in
   which to deploy the application. When you are finished, click Next.

5. Click Finish and the PDW completes deploying the application to the selected
   folder. Selected settings are stored in a script so that future deployments
   for the current application can be automated. Note that when you deploy the
   package to a local or network folder, the package is not unpacked or
   installed. The Package files are just copied to the selected location.
