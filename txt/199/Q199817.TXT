TITLE   :XFOR: Notes CALCON May Cause Session Leak on Notes Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You may notice that the number of session handles opened by the Lotus Notes
Calendar Connection (CALCON) may continually rise and not properly close out
during normal operation of the Microsoft Exchange Calendar Connector.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem is due to the incorrect configuration of the Notes client profile
used by the Microsoft Exchange Calendar Connector for Notes. If the location
document for the Calendar Connector's Notes profile is anything other than
Office, this problem will surface and potentially cause a failure on the Notes
server.

To ensure the correct operation of both the Microsoft Exchange Calendar Connector
for Notes and the Lotus Notes server, start up the Notes client using the same
Notes.ini\Profile as designated on the Calendar Connector Property page for
Notes. Ensure that the location document is set to Office. The location can be
found on the bottom right corner of the Notes desktop. Values such as Home
(modem), Internet, Island (Disconnected), or Travel (modem) are possible in
addition to Office. If the location document is set incorrectly, you will not be
able to access databases on the Notes server.
