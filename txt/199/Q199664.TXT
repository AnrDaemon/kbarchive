SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to remove more than two sections from an .ini file using the Edit
INI File script item, the action might fail. Despite this failure, the script
successfully removes two sections from the .ini file.

WORKAROUND
==========

Only delete up to two sections of an .ini file per Edit INI File script item in
your script. Use multiple Edit INI File script items to remove more than two
sections from an .ini file. For example, to delete four sections using a single
script, use two instances of the on Edit INI File script items in your script.
For each instance, delete no more than two sections.
