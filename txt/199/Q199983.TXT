======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0, remote control will display
the wrong curser icon when moving from the remote control window to the tools
window.

When the remote control window is open, and the foreground and a remote tools
window is open in the background, the incorrect cursor will be displayed when
the administrator resizes the remote window. The cursor will not go back to a
pointer until the curser is placed back into the remote control window or the
curser is clicked in the remote tools window.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
