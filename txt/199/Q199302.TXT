The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

The Calendar Connector (Calcon) supports the exchange of Free/Busy (F/B)
information between Exchange Server and Novell GroupWise. This article describes
the underlying mechanism between both systems.

Exchange Server to GroupWise
----------------------------

1. The Calcon server continually monitors all F/B requests using an internal
   store-based mechanism. The Calcon server is also responsible for sending and
   receiving F/B information based on which mail system the F/B query originated
   at.

2. The GroupWise provider writes a MSG-Type=SEARCH type API file in the Togwise
   directory. The following is an example of the API file:

   WPC-API= 1.2;
   MSG-TYPE= Search;
   Msg-ID= AFJDHGOI:1998.11.26.1.5:1999.1.25.1.5:1998.11.26.1.5.54;
   From=
    WPD= Exchange;
    WPPO= WasteLand;
    WPU= BEDLAM-SA;
    CDBA= Exchange.WasteLand.BEDLAM-SA; ;
   To=
    WPD= BETA 5;
    WPPO= Petaling Jaya;
    WPU= efong;
    CDBA= BETA 5.Petaling Jaya.efong; ;
   Begin-Time= 26/11/1998 1:5 +0;
   End-Time= 25/1/1999 1:5 +0;

3. The Microsoft Exchange Router for Novell GroupWise moves this API file from
   the Togwise directory to the Api_in directory on the NetWare server.

4. The API gateway then picks up the F/B query, sees that it is a SEARCH type
   message, and delivers the message to its internal GroupWise mail system for
   further processing.

GroupWise to Exchange Server (F/B Responses and Queries)
--------------------------------------------------------

1. The F/B response or query is dropped into the API gateway's Api_out
   directory.

2. The GroupWise router picks up the message and moves it to the Freebusy
   directory on the Exchange Server computer. The GroupWise provider then picks
   this message up.

3. The GroupWise provider translates the F/B message into an Exchange Server
   format, and hands it off to the Calcon server.

   If this is an F/B response from the GroupWise system, the new information is
   updated in the F/B public folder. If the F/B response has timed out, the new
   data will be automatically written to the folder, refreshing the old data
   accordingly. This way, the next user that queries for this same GroupWise
   user will have the new F/B information without going through another complete
   F/B transaction.

   If this is an F/B query, then the Calcon server sends a request to the MAPI
   provider for the appropriate F/B information for the target recipients.

API gateway, please refer to the Novell Web site at:

Note that both the Togwise and Freebusy directories exist under the
Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn\Gwrouter directory.
