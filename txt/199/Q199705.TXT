-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you are troubleshooting the Calendar Connector for Lotus Notes, it is very
difficult to find problems encountered when Notes users are trying to find
Free/Busy information for Exchange Server recipients. Most of the processes in
Notes are handled by server tasks. This article will describe a procedure to
enable detailed logging on the Notes server console to assist with
troubleshooting Notes to Exchange Server Free/Busy transactions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Stop the Notes server.

2. Find and modify the Notes.ini file for the Notes server. By default, it will
   be the Winnt directory.

3. Add the following line to the very end of the Notes.ini file:

   debug_sched_all=1

4. Save the Notes.ini file.

5. Restart the Notes server.

After restarting the Notes server, all activity by the Calendar Connector (a
Lotus Notes Server task) and, subsequently, the Exchange Calendar Connector (an
Exchange Server task) will be sent to the Notes server console. Note that the
logging activity will reduce the overall performance of the Notes server. The
debug_sched_all parameter should not be set to 1 unless you need to troubleshoot
the Exchange Calendar Connector.

Additional query words: C&M Web Drop 3, excalcon, notes logging, calcon
