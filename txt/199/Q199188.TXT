The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In the Exchange Administrator program, it is possible to add special characters
to the display name of a mailbox from the General tab of the mailbox. It is not
possible to add these special characters to the simple display name in the
Advanced tab of the mailbox.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The simple display name feature on the Advanced tab is specifically for
interoperability with foreign systems that do not recognize the special
characters set on the General tab within the mailbox properties. Although not
all special characters can be typed in the Simple Display field of the Advanced
tab, the following characters will be accepted:

   (),.?/:'=+-

A simple display name can coexist with the regular display name, however; the
simple display name will be displayed for systems that cannot understand the
special characters set in the General tab.
