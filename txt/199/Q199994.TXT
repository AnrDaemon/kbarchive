TITLE   :SMS: Removing a Server as a Distribution Server Leaves Reg Value
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbServer kbsms120

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Registry values for package locations on the site server still reflect a
distribution server that has been removed from the SMS hierarchy. As a result, a
job that sends this package to a client may update a client's .ins file and
contain the "removed" distribution server as a source for the package.

If you review the .ins file with Pcmdump.exe, the servers section will contain
the "removed" server.

Please see the References section for similar KB articles.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, cancel any active jobs for this package. Open the
registry on the site server and go to:

   Hkey_Local_Machine\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Components\ SMS_Despooler\Transfer
   Packages.

NOTE: The above registry location has been line-wrapped for readability.

Go to the W_packageid subkey. Under it are keys reflecting the distribution
servers that have an image of the package. Delete the subkey for the
distribution server that has been removed from the hierarchy.

Create a new job for this package and send it. The .ins files for the clients
will no longer reflect the "removed" server.
