The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When SQL Server queries take a great deal of time to process in an ASP page, the
Web browser may be left with a blank page while information is gathered from the
database. If you use Internet Explorer's Dynamic HTML features, a message can be
displayed to a Web browser while the data is processed and then changed or
erased when the page is finished being rendered.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following example ASP code uses a system Data Source Name (DSN) that points
to the Adventure Works example Microsoft Access database that shipped with IIS
3.0, but can be tested with any data source by changing the following two
lines:

   strSQL = "SELECT * FROM <Table Name>"
   RS.Open strSQL, "DSN=<Datasource Name>"

The following example page displays a message to the browser while loading the
data, then changes that message to the record count after the data is loaded.
Copy and save the following ASP code in your InetPub\Scripts folder as
DhtmTest.asp, and then test the page by browsing to
http://localhost/scripts/DhtmTest.asp.

      <html>
      <head><title>DHTML and ASP Example</title></head>
      <body>

      <h3 id="HideMe">Please wait while the data loads...</h3>

      <%
        Dim RS, strSQL, i
        Set RS = Server.CreateObject("ADODB.RecordSet")
        strSQL = "SELECT * FROM Products"
        RS.CursorType = 1 ' open with adOpenKeyset
        RS.Open strSQL, "DSN=AdvWorks"

        If Not RS.EOF Then
          Response.Write "<table border=1>" & vbCrLf

          Response.Write "<tr>"
          For i =  0 to (RS.Fields.Count - 1)
            Response.Write "<th>" & RS.Fields(i).Name & "</th>"
          Next
          Response.Write "</tr>" & vbCrLf
            
          Do While Not RS.EOF
            Response.Write "<tr>"
            For i =  0 to (RS.Fields.Count - 1)
              Response.Write "<td>" & RS.Fields(i).Value & "</td>"
            Next
            Response.Write "</tr>" & vbCrLf
            RS.MoveNext
          Loop

          Response.Write "</table>" & vbCrLf
        End If
      %>

      <script language="JavaScript" for="window" event="onload">
         HideMe.innerText='<%=RS.RecordCount%> Record(s) displayed.'
      </script>

      <% RS.Close %>

      </body>
      </html>

The above code can easily be modified to erase the message from the page by
changing the script section to read as follows:

      HideMe.style.display='none';
