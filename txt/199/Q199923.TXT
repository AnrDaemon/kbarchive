KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view events with the log browser in the Microsoft Exchange Connectivity
Administrator program, you must use the mouse to double-click on an event to
bring up the event details. Simply selecting the event and pressing the ENTER
key as you can in the Windows NT event viewer does not work.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This limitation is part of the original design of the user interface. A new user
interface is being considered for future versions of Microsoft Exchange Server.
