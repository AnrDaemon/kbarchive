OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 and use the Exchange Connectivity
product according to the documentation, you may run into errors when you attempt
to configure the Exchange Notes Connector.

After you load the Notes Configuration Utility, you need to create a New
Configuration Document, according to the documentation. After you run the Notes
Configuration Utility, you see the following error messages, multiple times, on
the screen.

   Unknown Lotus Script Error
   Error loading Use or Uselsx module
   Invalid Abstract Data Type

WORKAROUND
==========

If the client version is incorrect, you have two options to work around this
problem.

The first option allows the configuration document to open, however, you still
receive a number of error messages. You need to enable debugging. To do so, from
the Notes Configuration Utility, click the File menu, click Tools, and then
click Debug LotusScript.

The second option is to configure Notes manually. This should be done by
customers very familiar with the Notes administration utility.

MORE INFORMATION
================

the Notes Configuration Utility. This utility requires Notes Client version
