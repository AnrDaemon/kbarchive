KEYWORDS:kbSNMP kbsms100 smssnmp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server 1.2, administrators have the ability to configure
Windows NT events to be redirected as SNMP traps to SNMP-aware management
consoles such as with Systems Management Server.

When launching Event to Trap Translator under Personal Computer Properties, you
may receive the following error message:

   Can't load message file: \\SERVER\C$\%path%

Followed by:

   The current trap configuration contains at least one event description that
   is not valid. The corresponding event(s) will not be loaded.

CAUSE
=====

The event identifier message file contains spaces in its path.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. If you are not severely affected by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Systems
Management Server service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information on support costs, please go to the following Web

-----------------------------------------------------------
260,080   Eventrap.exe    (x86)
622,352   Eventrap.exe    (Alpha)


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, replace the Long File Name in the registry with the
short file name. For example put c:\progra~1\phoneb~1\bin\pbsvrmsg.dll in the
registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CCS\Services\Eventlog\<log>\<name>\CategoryMessageFile

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The EventMessageFile value(REG_EXPAND_SZ) is located under
\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\%LOG%\%SERVICE%\
and used as a placeholder for Event Identifier message files to provide
descriptions to Event Viewer.
