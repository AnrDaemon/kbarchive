SUMMARY
=======

Extended Hercules and Accelerated mode are the two options available during a
remote control troubleshooting session. Both of these options are for MS-DOS
client support only and are provided for backward compatibility when performing
remote troubleshooting on Systems Management Server version 1.2 sites.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can set various parameters during a remote control session that determine
how the Systems Management Server Administrator computer controls a remote
computer. For example, you can specify whether the system key sequences CTRL+
and ALT+ on the Systems Management Server Administrator computer are processed
locally at the Systems Management Server Administrator computer or passed
through to the remote client.

 - Select Extended Hercules Checking to monitor a Hercules-based client for
   graphics mode or text mode. Hercules checking slows down program execution
   but is required for controlling a client with a Hercules graphics card.

If you select Accelerated Mode, then the selected client sends screen refreshes
to the Systems Management Server Administrator computer as fast as the network
allows. Accelerated mode dramatically improves the refresh rate on the Systems
Management Server Administrator computer but slows down program execution on the
remote client.
