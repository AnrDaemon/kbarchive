SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to Exchange Server version 5.5 computer with a POP3
client, you may receive the following error message:

   Event ID 13005

   Source MSEchangePOP3

   Description:
   Logon attempt by USERNAME from IP ADDRESS to EXCHANGE SERVER has failed:
   EcGetMailboxDN call failed with error. There is no such mailbox on this
   server.

CAUSE
=====

The credentials being passed from the client to the Exchange Server computer do
not match the user's Windows NT account and/or mailbox.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Check the client configuration; please note that the steps for checking the
   configuration will vary depending on the type of client being used.

2. Change the account name to the format of
   <NT_domain>\<NT_account>\<Exchange_alias>.

3. Set the password to match the Windows NT password.

4. Save the changes, exit the client, and restart the client.

5. Connect to the Exchange Server POP3 service.

For an alternate resolution to this issue::

Change the alias name of the mailbox to the same as the NT account name. This
will enable you to use one account name (instead of typing in the full path as
described above).

If the connection still fails, follow the troubleshooting steps in the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q161118 XCLN: Troubleshooting POP3 Connections to Exchange Server

NOTE: The format of <NT_domain>\<NT_account>\<Exchange_alias>
should work when using Outlook 98 or Outlook Express clients. Results may vary
when other clients are being used.
