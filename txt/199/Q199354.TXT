TITLE   :XADM: Slow Intrasite Replication Issues with Exchange Server 5.5
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In some cases, intrasite replication may appear to be slow or take up to two
hours to complete. By default, Replication Latency is set to 300 seconds, plus
30 seconds per server in the site.

CAUSE
=====

The unusual latency can be attributed to many factors, including network
bandwidth saturation or name resolution problems. Other factors that cause the
latency may have to do with Remote Procedure Calls (RPC).

WORKAROUND
==========

The Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 release notes state that you must run Windows
NT 4.0 SP3 to install Exchange Server 5.5. It is also strongly recommended that
you at least install the Windows NT 4.0 post-SP3 fix before installing Exchange
Server 5.5 in your environment. This fix can be downloaded from the following
location:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/nt40/hotfixes-postsp3/roll-up/

Note: If you install a new Windows NT component, you should reapply the service
pack and any post-SP3 fixes. Windows NT SP4 or SP5 can be applied instead of
Windows NT SP3 and the post fixes.
