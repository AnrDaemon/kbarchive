SUMMARY
=======

In Systems Management Server 2.0, clients use the SMS_DEF.MOF file to determine
what information will be collected during the next hardware inventory. The
SMS_DEF.MOF file can be found on Windows 95, Windows 98, and Window NT systems
in the %WINDIR%\MS\SMS\Sitefile\<site code>\Hinv folder. In the event that
the system administrator needs to change the list of items collected by the
hardware inventory agent, the administrator must modify the master copy of the
SMS_DEF.MOF file stored on the site server in the following location:

   SMS\INBOXES\CLIFILES.SRC\HINV

Once the SMS_DEF.MOF file has been modified, the file will be automatically
replicated to all the defined client access points (CAP) for the site. The next
time the client service polls it will download the current MOF file from the
CAP. The Hardware Inventory Agent automatically checks the
%WINDIR%\MS\SMS\Sitefile\<site code>\Hinv folder for the new MOF. If it
finds a new MOF file, then it compiles and generates the new inventory.
