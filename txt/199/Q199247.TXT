TITLE   :XCON: Lsdxamex.exe Application Error Running LDE 3.2 Dirsync
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2; winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - LinkAge Message Exchange, version 3.2 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run directory synchronization (dirsync) between Exchange Server 5.5
(running on a Windows NT 4.0 computer with Service Pack 3 installed) and LinkAge
Directory Exchange (LDE) 3.2, you receive the following application error
message:

   Lsdxamex.exe application error. The instruction at "0X002b9dbd" referenced
   memory at "0X0000C" The memory could not be "read".

CAUSE
=====

The cause of the problem is that a corrupted message is being processed by LDE.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Look at the most recent linkage log file located in the Linkage\Logs folder.
   The files are created using the current date and adding a .log extension.
   Look in the log file for the location of the Dxamex.in and Dxm.in folders.

2. Stop the Linkage Directory Exchange service and delete all .rdy and .mpb
   files in the Exchconn\Q\Dxamex.in\ and Exchconn\Q\Dxm.in\ folders.

3. Start the LinkAge Directory Exchange service back up.

Now it is necessary to propagate the new information from the Linkage
administrator program. In the Linkage Administrator program:

1. Expand Directory Exchange Manager, expand Directory Exchange Agents, expand
   Linkage DXAMEX, and double-click Configuration.

2. Double-click Propagation, click Send Updates, and then click Updates Only.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There is no message generated in the application log and no User.dmp file. This
is not a Dr. Watson error.
