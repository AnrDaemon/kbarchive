SUMMARY
=======

SMS Service Manager is a Systems Management Server 2.0 component that is used to
monitor, start, and stop Systems Management Server services. To start the SMS
Service Manager, do the following:

1. Start the Systems Management Server Administrator Console.

2. Go to Site Database/Tools/SMS Service Manager.

3. On the Action menu, click Start SMS Service Manager.

To use SMS Service Manager, you navigate a tree that has two main branches:
Components and Servers. Under the Components branch, each Systems Management
Server service and thread is listed with servers running the specified component
listed below the component's name. The Components branch is useful for querying
and/or modifying the status of a service or thread on numerous servers. The
Servers branch allows access to Systems Management Server services and threads
listed by server. This branch is very useful for querying and/or modifying
numerous services on a single server.

Using either branch, services are selected by using the tree in the left pane.
When services are selected, they appear in the table on the right pane. No
information about a service or thread is initially available until you query the
service on the applicable server. To query the services, you must select the
services and/or threads you want and then click Query on the Component menu. The
services will then be queried, and the status of the selected services and/or
threads will be displayed under the Status column. The components can also be
started, stopped, paused, and resumed by selecting them and selecting the
appropriate action on the Component menu.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SMS Executive service performs numerous tasks and has numerous jobs, which
are each spawned as one or more threads within the SMS Executive service. These
threads can be stopped and started individually by using the SMS Service
Manager, by following the procedures above. Care should always be taken when
using SMS Service Manager to manipulate individual threads of SMS Executive.
Stopping, starting, pausing, or resuming one thread of SMS Executive may
sometimes affect other threads or the SMS Executive service itself.

When a service or thread needs the be halted, it can be stopped and started or it
can be paused and resumed. Although both of these procedures halt processing,
they are different. When a service or thread is stopped, it halts processing and
whatever instruction is currently being processed will be dropped. If the
instruction has not completed, it may not complete. When you restart that
service or thread, it will begin processing on the next available instruction.
Pausing a service or thread stops the processing without any instructions being
dropped. When a paused service is restarted, it continues processing from the
point it was stopped, and the current instruction is completed.
