TITLE   :XFOR: NNTP Protocol Commands are Case Insensitive
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

Exchange Server has implemented the NNTP protocol commands as case insensitive.
For example, if you send a search or group command for a folder alt.test, the
commands will return entries from alt.test and alt.TEST.

NOTE: The content of the search will maintain its case sensitivity.

This is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The decision was made not to support case sensitivity to be more flexible on the
data that is returned.
