TITLE   :XCLN: Windows 95 Exchange Client's Message Time Stamp is One Hou
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If Daylight Savings Time (DST) is set for manual adjustment on both the Windows
95 Exchange Client and the Exchange Server computer, messages sent from within
the Exchange Client will show a time stamp of one hour off.

This does not affect Windows NT clients, and does not happen when you use Outlook
on the Windows 95 clients. If the messages with the incorrect time stamp are
viewed with the Outlook client, the correct time stamp will be displayed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform one of the following:

 - Set automatic DST adjustment on the client and/or Exchange server.

 - Use the Outlook client.

 - Use Windows NT instead of Windows 95.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange clients,
versions 4.0 and 5.0, running on the Windows 95 platform.


Additional query words: DST, win95, xcln
