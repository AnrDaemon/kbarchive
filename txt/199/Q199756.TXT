SUMMARY
=======

This article offers some tips for modifying an Exchange Server registry key on a
Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Exchange Server services must be running before you change a registry key
for that service. For example, if you want to change the format of the display
name when you run directory synchronization with Lotus cc:Mail, the Exchange
Connector for Lotus cc:Mail must be running before you modify the registry on an
MSCS.

If you manually update these registry keys while the service is off-line, the
changes may not be replicated or may be lost. To prevent this from happening,
make any manual changes while the service is online. The ONLY registry that
should be modified is the registry of the active node.

MSCS provides registry checkpointing. Registry checkpointing for resources occurs
under the following conditions:

 - When you specify a new registry key for the resource, the specified key is
   checkpointed.

 - When the resource goes online, the registry keys are updated with the
   previously checkpointed information.

 - When the resource is brought offline, all the checkpoints associated with
   this resource are saved.

 - When the resource is online and changes are made to the registry key which is
   registered with the cluster server for replication, MSCS ensures that the
   updates are written to a checkpoint maintained on the quorum device.
