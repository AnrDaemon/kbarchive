The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, Macintosh Cross-Development Addon, versions 2.0, 4.0, 4.0b

SYMPTOMS
========

Not calling FreeResource may cause Macintosh applications to leak memory.

CAUSE
=====

Resources on the Macintosh are fairly similar to Windows resources, but there
are a few differences.

In Win32 applications, resources do not have to be locked or freed. On Macintosh
platforms, however, calling LockResource does actually lock a memory block in
the heap. Not calling FreeResource causes that block to remain locked.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid memory leaks and heap fragmentation, FreeResource must be used on the
Macintosh when a resource loaded using LoadResource is no longer needed.
