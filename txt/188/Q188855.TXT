SUMMARY
=======

Security Privilege Must be Enabled to View Security Event Log

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 includes a bug fix in the Event Log service that
requires SE_SECURITY_NAME privilege, also know as the Security privilege, to be
enabled in order to view and manage the security event log. By default, Windows
NT grants the privilege to Administrators and local System. However, the
privilege must also be enabled in the program accessing the security event log
in order to take effect.

This article updates information found in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
article:

   ARTICLE-ID: Q129126
   TITLE : New Access Privileges for Event Log, Audit Log and Registry

Prior to this change, members of the Administrators group and services running as
local System could open the security log for read or change access without
enabling the Security privilege. If the privilege was removed from the
Administrators group, members of the Administrators group could still manage the
security log. This change enforces the security model that if Administrators do
not have the privilege granted to manage the security log, they will not be able
to manage log simply because they are members of the Administrators group.
However, Administrators can always grant themselves the Security privilege to
manage the security log, although this event can be audited.

ISVs that provide programs to manage the security event log must enable the
privilege constant, SE_SECURITY_NAME, in their program. This privilege is
required to view and manage security event log information.

A sample program on how to enable privileges in Windows NT is available in the
Platform SDK under the following topic: Windows Base Services; Security; Access
Control; Using Access Control; Enabling and Disabling Privileges. Refer to the
SDK for documentation on interfaces: LookupPrivilegeValue and
AdjustTokenPrivileges for more information.

Background:

Windows NT privileges are granted to users or groups to allow them to manage
system resources. Privileges are granted to users or groups in the User Manager
under the Security Menu, User Rights option. The privilege to manage the
security log is identified as "Manage auditing and security log". Having the
privilege granted is not sufficient for use. Before you can perform the
operation defined by the privilege, the privilege must be enabled in the
security access token in order to take effect. The model allows privileges to be
enabled only for specific system operations and then disabled when they are no
longer needed.
