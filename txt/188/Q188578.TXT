TITLE   :SMS: PCMWin Exits at Startup If No SMS Logon Server Is Available
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Package Command Manager for Windows (PCMWin) starts, one of its first tasks
is to locate a Systems Management Server logon server. If no Systems Management
Server logon server is available, PCMWin exits. PCMWin does not restart until
the user logs off and then logs back on, restarts Windows, or manually restarts
PCMWin. Below is a sample output from the Pcmwin.log:

      Package Command Manager ==> Initializing .....
      Package Command Manager ==> PCM executed on 06/19/1998 10:39:28
      Package Command Manager ==> The PCM History file was created on
      06/11/1998 15:12:23
      Package Command Manager ==> Failed to connect to SMS Logon Server.
      Package Command Manager ==> Exiting .........
