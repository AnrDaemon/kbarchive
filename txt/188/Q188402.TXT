KEYWORDS:kbHTMLHelp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Included with Visual FoxPro for Windows version 6.00 are two files named
Xsource.zip and Solnhlp.zip. They are located in the \Tools\XSource folder under
the folder returned by the Visual FoxPro HOME() function.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Unzipping the Xsource.zip file with the pkunzip.exe -d parameter creates a
folder named \vfpsource. The \vfpsource folder contains the following folders:

   \Addlabel
   \Browser
   \Builders
   \Coverage
   \Wizards

Unzipping the Solnhlp.zip file with the pkunzip.exe -d parameter creates a folder
named \Solution. The \Solution folder contains 128 files which are the source
code for the Solutions sample application (for the purpose of showing how to
create a context sensitive HTML help file). These folders are also created:

   \Compiled
      \Html
      \Stylesheets
