TITLE   :Random Stop 0x0000000A When Running IPX over Token Ring
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Random STOP 0x0000000A error messages may occur in NDIS, NWLNKIPX, NWLNKSPX, or
NTOSKRNL when running the IPX/SPX protocol over token ring.

NOTE: These problems have been experienced with IBM PCI Token Ring adapters using
the Ibmtrp.sys driver. Olicom PCI Token Ring adapters have had reports of
similar problems.

The Stop 0x0000000A seems to occur most often following an IPX send packet in the
packet clean up routines. At times, the system may seem stable before
experiencing the problem. Other times the system may fail during startup
immediately following the load of the NWLNKSPX driver when the first packet
attempts to be sent.


CAUSE
=====

The cause of the problem is NDIS packet corruption caused by pool corruption.
Most often, the NDIS packet header was found to be corrupt following the send of
the packet on the wire. In particular, the
"pNdispacket->protocolReserved->srConnFile" field was found to be
corrupted.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
