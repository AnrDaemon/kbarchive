"Pan European" refers to the version of Windows that is distributed in Eastern
European countries such as Poland, Greece and Turkey. The Pan European version
of Windows is very similar to the English version, but supports extended
characters that are used in those regions.

Other European language versions of Windows, such as German, French, Spanish, and
Italian, are considered "localized" versions.
