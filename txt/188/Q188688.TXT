SYMPTOMS
========

When you go to the Tools menu in the Exchange client, the Inbox Assistant and
Out of Office Assistant menu items are missing.

CAUSE
=====

The Inbox Assistant and Out Of Office Assistant are removed from the Tools menu
after uninstalling Netscape Navigator, version 2.01. This is caused by a
registry key that is removed during the uninstall of Netscape. The missing
registry key is:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Client\Extensions

Before Uninstalling Netscape
----------------------------

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use

Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk

1. Run the Registry Editor and export the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Client\Extensions

2. Uninstall Netscape.

3. Import the registry key that was exported in step 1.

After Uninstalling Netscape
