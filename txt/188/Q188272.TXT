log:

   Event ID: 4106
   Source: MSExchangeIMC
   Category: SMTP Interface Events
   Description: The dial-up connection <phonebook entry name here>
   could not be  made. The error reported was: [87] The parameter
   is incorrect.

WORKAROUND

This issue may be caused by a dial-up networking connection name that has more
than 20 characters in the length.

To solve this issue, perform the following the steps:

1. Create a new phonebook entry in the Dial-Up Connections tab of the Internet
   Mail Service or the Connections tab for Message Delivery. Create a new
   phonebook entry in the Dial-up networking phonebook with 20 or less
   characters in the name.

2. Remember to change the configuration of the Internet Mail Service to use this
   newly created phonebook entry.

3. To test this, send another message and check the event log.
