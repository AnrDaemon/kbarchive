TITLE   :BUG: EditCopy Incorrectly Copies Series Edge/Line Color of Chart
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Editcopy method of the MSChart control to copy a chart to the
clipboard, the Edge/Line color and style of the series is not correct.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, contain the MSChart control within a PictureBox and
then use Win32 API functions to capture the PictureBox image. For more
information about capturing an image using the Win32 API functions, see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q161299 HOWTO: Capture and Print the Screen, a Form, or any Window

(You will be adding code from the above article if you use the procedures
below.)

The workaround is described in more detail in the MORE INFORMATION section of
this article.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Click Components on the Project menu and check "Microsoft Chart Control."

3. Add an MSChart control to Form1.

4. Right-click the MSChart control and choose Properties from the drop-down
   menu.

5. Select the Series Color tab. Change the Interior color of Series "C1" from
   Red to Purple. Note that this also changes the Edge/Line Color to Purple as
   well. Click OK.

6. Add the following code to the Click event of Form1:

         MSChart1.EditCopy

7. Press the F5 key to run the project. Click Form1.

8. Run another application, such as Paint or Word, and paste the clipboard
   contents. (Use Paste Special if you see the chart's data instead of the
   actual chart.) Note that in the picture of the chart, Series "C1" has a
   purple interior but the edge/line color is red.

Workaround
----------

1. Start a new project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a PictureBox control to Form1.

3. Add an MSChart control so that it is inside the PictureBox control.

4. Right-click the MSChart control and choose Properties from the drop-down
   menu.

5. Select the Series Color tab. Change the Interior color of Series "C1" from
   Red to Purple. Notice that this also changes the Edge/Line Color to Purple as
   well. Click OK.

6. Add the following code to the Click event of Form1:

         Dim pic As Picture

         With Picture1
           'Size/position the picture box so that it matches
           'the MSChart control
           .Width = MSChart1.Width
           .Height = MSChart1.Height
           MSChart1.Top = 0
           MSChart1.Left = 0
           'Get a picture of the contents of the picturebox
           Set pic = CaptureWindow(.hWnd, False, 0, 0, _
               .ScaleX(.Width, vbTwips, vbPixels), _
               .ScaleY(.Height, vbTwips, vbPixels))
         End With

         'Copy the picture to the clipboard
         Clipboard.Clear
         Clipboard.SetData pic

7. Add a Module to the project.

8. Add the code in step 6 in the MORE INFORMATION section of the following
   article to the Module:

   Q161299 HOWTO: Capture and Print the Screen, a Form, or any Window

9. Run the project and click the Form to copy the chart to the clipboard.
