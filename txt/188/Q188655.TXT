-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

There is an error in the documentation of the NetBIOS cachetimout registry
entry. In both the TCP/IP Implementation Details Version 2.0 white paper and the
Windows NT Resource Kit, the low end of the valid range is documented as being
in decimal and the high end of the range is documented in hex, as seen below:

   CacheTimeout
   Key: Netbt\Parameters
   Value Type: REG_DWORD - Time in milliseconds
   Valid Range: 60000 to 0xFFFFFFFF
   Default: 0x927c0 ( 600000 milliseconds = 10 minutes)

   Description: This value determines the time interval that names are
   cached in the remote name table.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

The correct entry should look like:

   CacheTimeout
   Key: Netbt\Parameters
   Value Type: REG_DWORD - Time in milliseconds
   Valid Range: 0xEA60 to 0xFFFFFFFF
   Default: 0x927c0 ( 600000 milliseconds = 10 minutes)

   Description: This value determines the time interval that names are
   cached in the remote name table.
