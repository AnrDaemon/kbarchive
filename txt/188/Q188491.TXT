SYMPTOMS
========

When the Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 option Append Footers is
selected for a given virtual root, all files and/or documents downloaded from
that v-root will have footers appended regardless of document type. For example,
HTML, ASP, EXE, GIFs, JPGs, and so on will all have footers appended. In some
cases this will cause the browser downloading the file or document to hang.

CAUSE
=====

Some documents will download with no problem due to the document's format. Other
documents do not have a length indicator, which causes the file being downloaded
to become corrupted due to the appended footer.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

 - Place only HTML documents under v-roots that are marked for auto-footer
   application.

 - Use the Mdutil found in the Windows NT Option Pack to set the Footer Enable
   value to 0.

The following example shows how to set this attribute for one document:

   Mdutil set /w3svc/1/root/foo.htm/FooterEnabled  0

The following example shows how to set this attribute for an entire group of
documents:

   For %%I in (*.exe) mdutil set /w3svc/1/root/%%I/FooterEnabled 0
