-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Administrators may want to import and export information from the Permissions
page of Exchange mailboxes, distribution lists, and custom recipients.

This can be accomplished by constructing an export/import .CSV header file that
contains the Obj-Admins, Obj-Perm-Admins, and Obj-Users fields.

NOTE: The information in this article also applies to manipulating permissions
for Custom Recipients and Distribution Lists.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Each Exchange mailbox has a "Primary Windows NT Account" entry that gives a
Windows NT user permission to access the mailbox. You can configure additional
Windows NT permissions on a mailbox and thus allow multiple Windows NT accounts
to have access to a single Exchange object.

NOTE: You can also allow multiple Windows NT account access by assigning a
Windows NT group as the "Primary Windows NT Account".

Additional Windows NT account permissions may be configured on the Permissions
property page for an object.

By default, the Permissions page is not displayed in Exchange Administrator for
most objects. To display it for all objects, from the Tools menu, select
Options. Click the Permissions tab, and then select "Show Permissions page for
all objects".

Obj-Admins, Obj-Perm-Admins and Obj-Users are "pseudo-attributes" created for the
purpose of bulk import and export of additional Permissions.

Obj-Admins corresponds to the Windows NT accounts that have Administrator access
to the object. Obj-Perm-Admins corresponds to Permissions Admin, and Obj-User to
User permissions.

The following is an example of a default export CSV header with the Permissions
pseudo-attribute fields added to it:

   Obj-Class,First Name,Last name,Display Name,Alias Name,Directory
   Name,Primary Windows NT Account,Home-Server,E-mail address,E-mail
   Addresses,Members,Obj-Container,Hide from AB,Obj-Admins,Obj-Perm-
   Admins,Obj-Users

The above header may be copied and used in a .CSV file. To do this:

1. Open Notepad or another plain text editor and paste the header into it. The
   header should be the first and only line in the file and is intended to be a
   single long line terminated with a carriage return.

2. Save the file as <filename>.CSV and exit Notepad.

3. In Exchange Administrator, select Tools.Directory Export, and export to the
   file you just created.

Additional Notes
----------------

 - Windows NT account information should be entered in the .CSV file in this
   format:

   domain-name\user-name%domain-name>\user-name2 . . .

   (A percentage sign separates multiple Windows NT accounts granted the same
   permissions.)

 - You can delete all the Windows NT Accounts assigned Permissions Admin, Admin,
   or User rights on the object by inserting ~DEL into the appropriate field of
   an import file. This does not delete the permissions of the Primary Windows
   NT Account for a mailbox or the permissions of the Owner for a distribution
   list.

 - If you enter an invalid Windows NT account in an import file, it is ignored.
   You cannot add permissions for Windows NT accounts that do not exist or that
   cannot be currently validated by a Windows NT domain controller.

 - Custom and Send As permissions cannot be exported, imported, or deleted
   through bulk import. They are invisible to the export/import process. If you
   inadvertently import the same Windows NT account under two or more
   permissions headings, the permissions granted to the account will be additive
   and will cause the account to show Custom permissions. For example, if you
   import the same account in both the Obj-Admins and Obj- Users fields, the
   account will have both administrative and mailbox read/send permissions.
   After this happens, you can no longer affect the account through
   import/export but must manage the account through the Exchange Administrator
   interface.
