SUMMARY
=======

When you publish a Web containing a WebBot Search component to a Web server
hosting Microsoft Index Server, the code for the component is replaced with
Index Server code.

MORE INFORMATION
================

FrontPage uses a WebBot Search component that calls the search engine of the
FrontPage Server Extensions. However, if you publish your Web to a Microsoft
Internet Information Server on which Microsoft Index Server is installed, the
Index Server replaces the functionality delivered by the WebBot Search
component. Because the default configuration for Index Server is different from
the FrontPage search functionality, you may experience unexpected behavior. If
you know that Index Server is performing your searches, contact your Web
Presence Provider for assistance in configuring Index Server.

You can determine whether Index Server or FrontPage is performing your searches.
To do this, follow these steps:

1. Start your Web browser.

2. Open the Web site you want to check.

3. View the HTML source code and look for the following line of code

   b-useindexserver="x"

   where x equals a 1 or 0. If x equals 0, FrontPage is performing the search; if
   x equals 1, Index Server is performing the search.
