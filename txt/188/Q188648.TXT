KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The steps to enable Advanced Security on a site are different in Exchange Server
version 5.5 than in version 5.0. This article explains how to enable Advanced
Security on a site when you are running Exchange Server version 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To set up Advanced Security in Exchange Server 5.0, setup needs to be run and
Key Management Server pointed to the existing server or site running Key
Management Server. In Exchange Server 5.5, the security objects are already
installed and Key Management Server simply needs to be pointed to the existing
server.

To enable security in an Exchange Server 5.5 site, get properties on the Site
Encryption Configuration object in the Configuration container of the site.
Select "Choose Site.." next to the Primary KMS Server location field. Select the
site that is running the main Key Management Server database.
