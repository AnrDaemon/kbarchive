TITLE   :XADM: Adding Recipients To a Form May Change Display Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An application such as Electronic Forms Designer uses MAPI to resolve a list of
display names. If you add names to a form and some of the names have already
been resolved during a previous instance, the display names that had been
previously resolved will have their display name changed to the internal
Microsoft Exchange Server distinguished name. A display name may look like the
following:

   James Smith

After you add a new name to the form, a distinguished name for this fictitious
user will look like the following:

   =EX:/p=YourPrmd/ou=YourOrgUnit/cn=Recipients/cn=SmithJ

CAUSE
=====

The distinguished name for the addressee was erroneously being saved to the
display name property.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
