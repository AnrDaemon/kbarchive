TITLE   :XFOR: Error Removing Directory Synchronization Objects
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When removing a directory synchronization server (DXA server), directory
synchronization requestor, or a remote directory synchronization requestor using
Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, you may receive the following
error messages:

   An internal processing error has occurred: Naming Violation
   Microsoft Exchange Directory
   ID no: DS_E_NAMING_VIOLATION

   The object cannot be found in the directory.
   This may be because replication has not completed.
   Microsoft Exchange Directory
   ID no: c1010aae

   The attribute does not exist
   Microsoft Exchange Directory
   ID no: DS_E_NO_SUCH_ATTRIBUTE_OR_VALUE

CAUSE
=====

These errors may occur if the Microsoft Mail Connector for PC Networks was
removed through Add/Remove Components in the Exchange Server Setup before
deleting the directory synchronization (dirsync) objects, (dirsync requestor,
dirsync server, and so on) through the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator
program.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, you need to delete the directory synchronization
server object. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode by
   typing the following at a command prompt:

   admin /r

   WARNING: Using the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program
   (admin/r) incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to
   reinstall Microsoft Windows NT Server and/or Microsoft Exchange Server.
   Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of
   raw mode can be solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

2. Expand on Site, Configuration, Servers, <Server Object>, and then
   select the Directory Service object.

3. On the File menu, click Raw Properties.

4. From the Object Attributes list, select the OBJ-DIST-NAME.

5. Select the text in the Edit Value text box, copy it to the Clipboard, and
   then click OK.

6. Expand on Site, Configuration, Connections, and then select <Dirsync
   Server Object>. On the File menu, click Raw Properties.

7. In the Raw Properties dialog box, select All from the "List Attributes of
   Type" drop-down box.

8. Find the Responsible-Local-DXA property.

9. Select the text in the Edit Value text box, and then paste the address of the
   Directory Synchronization Object that you copied to the Clipboard in step
   five.

10. Click Set, and then click OK.

11. Select the "Directory Synchronization Server Object" and delete it.

   Doing so may generate a "Constraint_Violation" error message, but you should
   be able to delete the object after the error.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The proper way to remove a Microsoft Mail Connector is to remove the Directory
Synchronization objects from within Exchange Server Administrator program before
removing the component through the Setup Add/Remove feature.
