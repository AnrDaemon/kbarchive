SYMPTOMS

occurs:

   A stop control has been sent to a service which other running
   services are dependent on.

   Component: Administrator Program

   File Name   Version
   ----------------------
   Admin.exe   5.5.2440.0

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Start the Cluster Administrator program and open the group that was created
   for Exchange Server.

2. Right-click on each Resource Type of Generic Service (these are the Exchange
   Server service resources in the Exchange Cluster group such as Microsoft
   Exchange Server directory, Event service, information store, and so on).

3. Click Properties on the pop-up menu, and then click the Advanced tab.

4. Click the "Do not restart" radio button, and then click the OK button for
   each of these services.

5. Open the Exchange Server Administrator program and connect to the clustered
   Exchange Server computer.

6. Open the Configuration object, and then open the Servers object. Highlight
   the server that is the clustered Exchange Server computer.

7. Click File, click Properties, and then click the Advanced tab.

8. Change the state of Database Circular Logging and then click OK. When you go
   back to the Exchange Administrator program, circular logging will be changed.

9. In the Cluster Administrator program, open the group that was created for
   Exchange Server.

10. Right-click on each Resource Type of Generic Service again, click Properties
   on the pop-up menu, and then click the Advanced tab.

11. Click the "Restart" radio button and click the OK button for each of these
   services.

12. Right-click on each of the Exchange Server service resources and choose
   "Bring Online" on the pop-up menu. The services should then come online in
   the cluster.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 2.
