TITLE   :XADM: Replying To or Forwarding Resent Message Causes NDR
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you send a message that causes a non-delivery report (NDR) to be sent, and
then you successfully resend the message to a recipient that is located in the
same Microsoft Exchange Server site as you, the recipient may receive an NDR if
they reply to or forward the message. However, if the recipient attempts to
resend the message, it is sent successfully.

CAUSE
=====

When you resend a message after receiving an NDR, the recipients that caused the
NDR to be sent are assigned a type of MAPI_P1. This recipient type is only valid
for messages that are resent after an NDR is received. If the message is resent
to a local recipient, and then the recipient replies to or forwards the message,
some of the recipients may still be assigned a type of MAPI_P1. Because this
recipient type is only valid for resent messages, this causes the recipient to
receive an NDR.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
