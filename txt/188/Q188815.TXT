TITLE   :Notes Connector Error Msg: Unable to Find Path to Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to configure the Exchange 5.5 Notes Connector for Lotus Notes,
using the Exchange Connectivity Administrator, you may receive one of the
following error message:

   LME-NOTES-NTSMEX(00a0) 2 41300:<Notes Package ID>: Client Access
   <CLIENT>. Extended Reason String: Unable to find path to server

   -or-

   Failed to get a list of users from the lotus notes name and address book for
   server <servername> notes returned error code 0x0803 unable to find
   path to server.

   -or-

   Failed to get the list of users from the notes name and address book for
   server name <servername> notes returned error code 0x0807

These error messages occur even though the Lotus Notes client can connect to the
Lotus Notes server.

CAUSE
=====

These errors may be generated if duplicates of the Nnotes.dll file exist within
the system path. The Exchange Notes Connector for Lotus Notes requires this
file. By default, there should be only one instance of this .dll file on the
Exchange Server computer's hard disk.

This single instance of Nnotes.dll should be left in the default location, where
the Notes client places it during Setup (in the \NOTES directory). If a copy of
this .dll file resides in the \WINNT\SYSTEM32 directory, you may see the above
errors.

WORKAROUND
==========

Perform the following steps to work around this behavior:

1. Use Windows Explorer to search for all the files named Nnotes.dll.

2. Remove all instances of the Nnotes.dll file except the one that exists in the
   \NOTES directory.

3. Add <drive>:\NOTES to the system's PATH environment variable, where
   <drive> is the drive letter such as C or D.

4. Restart the Exchange Server computer for the change to take effect.

After the server has been restarted, the Exchange Notes Connector for Lotus Notes
should start and operate without the "Unable to find path to server" error.
