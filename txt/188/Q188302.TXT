TITLE   :XADM: Clean Mailbox Command Cannot Delete Based on Date Received
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

If you use the Clean Mailbox command on the Tools menu in the Microsoft Exchange
Server Administrator program to delete messages that are older than a certain
number of days, the age of the messages is calculated based on the date the
message was last modified. You cannot cause the age of the messages to be
calculated based on the date the message was originally received.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft recognizes the need for people to use the Clean Mailbox command to
delete messages based on the date the messages were received. We have modified
the Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 Administrator program so that when you
delete messages that are older than a certain number of days, the age of the
messages can be calculated based on either of the following criteria:

 - The date the message was last modified.

 - The date the message was received.

After this feature is enabled, select Last Modified Date in the Clean Mailbox
dialog box to delete messages based on the date the messages were last modified.
To delete messages based on the date the messages were received, select Received
Date in the Clean Mailbox dialog box. To view the Clean Mailbox dialog box,
follow these steps:

1. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program. To do so, click Start, point
   to Programs, point to Microsoft Exchange, and then click Microsoft Exchange
   Administrator.

2. In the left pane, click the Recipients container under the appropriate site.
   In the right pane, click a mailbox, and then on the Tools menu, click Clean
   Mailbox.


This supported feature is now available, but has not been fully regression tested
and should be applied only to systems having a specific need for it. Unless you
are severely impacted by the lack of this feature, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this feature. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.


We have also modified the Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 Administrator
program to support this feature. This feature is included in the latest
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 U.S. service pack. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
