TITLE   :Global ASA Not Firing When Visual InterDev Made IIS 4.0 App
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::1.0,4.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnokeyword

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual InterDev, versions 1.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After creating a new application with Visual InterDev on Internet Information
Server 4.0 (IIS), the code in the Global.asa for this application does not
execute. A common symptom is while an administrator is logged into the IIS 4.0
computer, applications are created successfully, and when an administrator is
not logged into the IIS computer, projects are not created as applications.

CAUSE
=====

If the virtual directory that contains the Global.asa is not set as an
Application Root, the code in the Global.asa will not be executed. Visual
InterDev will be unable to create an application root if the Microsoft
Transaction Server (MTS) system package logon identity is set to "Interactive
user - the current logged on user" and no one is currently logged on or the
current logged on does not have the proper permissions to create an MTS package.

RESOLUTION
==========

During the installation of Internet Information Server 4.0, a user can specify
the account for MTS sessions to run under. By default, the Interactive User is
specified. What this means is that when there is no Interactive User (for
example, an administrator is not logged onto the Web server), administrative
operations that require authentication, such as creating an Application Root,
fail.

Use the following steps to resolve existing problems:

1. Bring up the Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

2. Right-click the directory that contains the Global.asa that is not firing and
   select "properties."

3. Select the Directory or Virtual Directory tab.

4. Click the Create button to establish this directory as an application root.

While the above steps will resolve existing problems, you can use the following
steps to prevent future problems:

1. Bring up the MMC for the server.

2. Expand "Microsoft Transaction Server."

3. Expand "Computers."

4. Expand "My Computer."

5. Expand "Packages Installed."

6. Right-click "System" and bring up the Property page.

7. On the Identity tab, change from the interactive user to a user that is an
   administrator* on the machine.

8. Close the Property page.

9. Reboot.

*Following are steps to create an account to use for the MTS System Package:

Follow these steps to use the user manager:

1. Create a new local group and name it MTS Administrators.

2. Create a new user and name it MTS Administrator.

3. Make the new user a member of the both the Administrators group and the MTS
   Administrators group,

4. Give the new user the advanced user right to log on as a service.

Internet Information Server 4.0 product documentation under Getting Started
Release Notes for Microsoft Transaction Server
