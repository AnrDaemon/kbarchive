CAUSE

RESOLUTION

You need to manually register the Msstkprp.dll file.

Step-by-Step Procedure
----------------------

1. Copy the Msstkprp.dll file from \OS\System folder on your Visual Basic CD to
   your Windows\System folder (or the System32 folder if you are using Microsoft
   Windows NT).

2. Use the RegSvr32 utility to manually register the Msstkprp.dll. On the
   Windows Start menu, click Run, and then type the following command:

   "Regsvr32 C:\Windows\System\Msstkprp.dll" (without the quotation marks)

MORE INFORMATION
