======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to a network share on a Microsoft Windows NT server,
the connection attempt may not succeed and you may receive the error message
"Access Denied," even though you do have permissions to the network share.

For example, this error message may appear when you click Start, click Run, and
then type a command such as the following sample command in the Open box:

   \\<servername>\<sharename>

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur if the Windows NT server has a large number of shares
(approximately 1,000 or more), especially if the share name appears towards the
end of the list of share names (sorted alphabetically). Under such conditions,
the list of network share names may exceed 64 kilobytes (KB), and the share name
may not appear within the first 64 KB of this list.


RESOLUTION
==========
