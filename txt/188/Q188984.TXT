 - Microsoft Cluster Server

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Cluster Server does not support the ability to fail over Microsoft
Office products. These products are not cluster-aware, although it is possible
to install Office into the shared small computer system interface (SCSI) drive
they do not fail over correctly and are not supported as a failover application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The commercially reasonable effort to make this work in a limited fashion on a
Windows 95 client is to disable Osa.exe and Findfast.exe from the Startup group
on the client computer. This lets the client quit the application and restart
the application if need be. On a computer running Windows NT Workstation or
Windows NT Server, you can quit the process by going to the Processes tab in
Task Manager, and then by clicking End Process on the Osa.exe application.


Additional query words: reboot mscs w2000mscs osa exe
