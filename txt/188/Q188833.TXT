SUMMARY
=======

Collaboration Data Objects (CDO) only publishes three months of Free/Busy data.
Until recently, this limit could not be configured.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Exchange Server version 5.5 Service Pack 2 introduces a new user option of
"FreeBusyMonths" that is added to the CDO Session object. This user object
contains the number of months of Free/Busy data to publish, which must be
greater than or equal to 2. The default value is three months. This new user
object can be accessed by the GetOption() and SetOption methods of the Session
object.


For example, the following line of code demonstrates how to set the
FreeBusyMonths option to 12 months. The code snippet assumes that objSession is
a valid CDO Session object:

   objSession.SetOption "FreeBusyMonths", 12

You can find the current value of FreeBusyMonths as follows:

   CurrentValue = objSession.GetOption("FreeBusyMonths")

This feature is available in the latest service pack for Exchange Server version
5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
