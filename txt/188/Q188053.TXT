SUMMARY
=======

Writeqdf.Exe is a utility that comes in the Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit 1.
This utility has the capability to import and export Systems Management Server
queries. The query is saved as a query definition file (.qdf), which can then be
used to import the queries to other sites.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The .qdf is a format for storing "canned queries" for distribution between
Systems Management Server sites.

You can import queries to site servers by using the /IMPORT flag and export
queries from site servers by using the /EXPORT flag.

The purpose of the WRITEQDF tool and .qdf files is to give administrators an easy
method for distributing their standard queries between Systems Management Server
sites within their company.

Syntax
------

      WRITEQDF <server> <account> <password> <database> <QDF file> <ID>
      </IMPORT or /EXPORT>

For example, to export, you would use a command like:

      WRITEQDF ncpesdm15 sa "" sms12 NCS00051 /export

NOTE: ncs00051 is the query ID seen in the Queries window of the Systems
Management Server Administrator program.

For example, to import, you would use a command like:

         WRITEQDF ncpesdm15 sa "" sms12 offpro97.qdf /import

You do not need to specify the query ID when importing, because the imported
queries will use the ID scheme of the site you are importing to.

Note that if you run WRITEQDF with the /IMPORT switch and use the same .qdf file,
you will see duplicate queries, but with different Query ID numbers.

If the account you use to access SQL Server has a blank password, you will need
to include two double quotation marks together to represent the password on the
WRITEQDF command line.
