TITLE   :SMS Admin Shows Incomplete List of Paths for Software Inventory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbInventory kbsmsAdmin smsadmin smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the client Inventory Agent (for example, Invwin32 and/or Invdos) performs a
software inventory, it will scan the local drives for files that match the
criteria defined in the Inventory Package properties.

If you create an Inventory Package to search for multiple files that exist in the
same directory on the client, Systems Management Server will only report the
first file that is found. This occurs regardless of the search logic. It makes
no difference whether you use the AND operator or the OR operator.

Software inventory does continue to search the directory for other files that
have been defined, but it does not actually report the information about the
other files found in SMS Admin. If multiple files are present, only the first
file defined in the Software Inventory package will be displayed in the client's
Packages icon in Personal Computer Properties.

WORKAROUND
==========

Create a separate Software Inventory package for each file that you need to
locate.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
