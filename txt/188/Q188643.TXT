The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Exchange Server it is possible to create Custom Views for the
Exchange Server clients to view; however, it is not possible to remove the
Global Address List entry from view.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you create the Custom Views using Address Book Views and Search
permissions, the clients will only be able to view the containers that they have
permissions to view (as described in the Microsoft Knowledge Base article,
Q182902, "XADM: How To Setup Container Level Search Control"). Although it is
not possible to hide the words, "Global Address List," it is possible to alter
or limit what the clients see in the Global Address List when they connect to
the Exchange Server computer. The Global Address List will contain all
recipients listed in the containers in which the user has permissions to view.
