-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to use Pfadmin.exe to remove mailboxes from the
permissions list of Microsoft Exchange Server public folders.

Pfadmin.exe ships with the Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit, Second and Third
Editions, and allows an Exchange Server administrator to manipulate public
folders.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To remove a mailbox from the permissions list of a public folder, perform the
following steps:

1. On the Exchange Server computer or another server or workstation, install
   Pfadmin.exe from the BackOffice CD by copying the files Pfadmin.exe and
   Aclcls.dll to the local hard drive.

2. Install the Exchange client or Microsoft Outlook, on the computer used in the
   previous step.

3. Log on to Windows NT as the Exchange Service Account or an account that has
   Service Account Admin privilege on the Exchange Organization Site and
   Configuration containers.

4. Create a MAPI profile called "PFProfile". Add the Exchange Server Service to
   the profile and configure this service with a valid mailbox and server name.

5. Type the the following command from an MS-DOS command prompt:

   PFADMIN "PFProfile" SETACL "<Folder Path>" "<Mailbox Name>"
   remove no

   Where <Folder Path> is the full path to the public folder <Mailbox
   Name> is the display name of the mailbox to be removed from the
   permissions list of the folder specified by <Folder Path>

   NOTE: The above command will only remove the mailbox from the folder
   specified. If you wish to recursively remove the mailbox from the permissions
   of the specified folder and all its sub-folders, then do not type "no"
   (without the quotation marks) at the end of the above command.

   Make sure that you are using version 1.30 or later of Pfadmin.exe
