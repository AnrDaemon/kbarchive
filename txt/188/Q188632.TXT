TITLE   :XFOR: Internet Mail Service Missing from Control Panel
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Remove All and Reinstall to recover a Microsoft Exchange Server
computer, and you recover the database files (Priv.edb or Dir.edb), the Internet
Mail Service Connector may appear in the Organization\ Site\ Configuration
Container\ Connections Container, but the Internet Mail Service service may be
missing from the Control Panel Services.

CAUSE
=====

If the Internet Mail Service was previously installed and configured on this
Exchange Server computer, the directory or information store database may have
had knowledge of that connector and restored that information to the Exchange
Server computer, but removed the service reference from the registry.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Delete the Internet Mail Service Connector from the three connections
   containers in the Organization, Site, and Configuration containers.

2. Run the Internet Mail Service Wizard to configure the Internet Mail Service
   connector and create the Internet Mail Service in Control Panel Services.
