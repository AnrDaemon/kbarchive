TITLE   :XCLN: Attachment Dropped During Forward of Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Messaging, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

An Internet message with more than one attachment is received by an Exchange
Internet Mail Service and passed to a Microsoft Mail postoffice through the MS
Mail Connector Interchange (MSMI). The message is then opened by an Exchange
client using the Microsoft Mail Service Provider (to access the MS Mail
postoffice). When the message is opened, all attachments are present. When the
message is forwarded, one of the attachments is missing from the forwarded
message.

CAUSE
=====

The message attachments were processed incorrectly when the message was moved
from the MS Mail postoffice into the Exchange client's Inbox in the user's
personal folder (PST) file.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange client
version 5.0 and the Windows Messaging Client for Windows 95 RTM.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next service pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
