SUMMARY
=======

When using the Windows NT trusted domain model in your Systems Management Server
sites, you should consider the following:

 - There should be one Global Systems Management Server Service Account in the
   trusted domain. Do not place multiple Local Systems Management Server Service
   Account in each domain.

 - The Systems Management Server Service Account must be a member of the Local
   Administrators group in all domains in the site.

 - The Systems Management Server Service Account must have Log On As A Service
   rights in all domains in the site.

When installing new sites and when configuring senders, you must specify the
(trusted) domain and the Systems Management Server Service Account using the
correct syntax: <domain>\<account>.

You should also note that if you are using the Windows NT master domain model,
all clients will appear in the Systems Management Server Administrator under the
master domain by default, even if they belong to another (trusting) domain. To
prevent this from occurring, and to make it easier to locate a particular
client, you can modify the Smsls.ini file to make clients appear in a domain
other than the master domain.
