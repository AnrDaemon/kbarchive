SUMMARY
=======

To make security debugging easier, you may want to disable caching of the
anonymous user account in Internet Information Server version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can do this by setting the PasswordCacheTTL property to zero (0). By
default, Internet Information Server will cache the anonymous user account for
10 minutes. To change the PasswordCacheTTL value to zero (0), type the following
at the command line:

   adsutil set w3svc/1/PasswordCacheTTL "0"

The following sample code can be called from Visual Basic, ASP, and Windows
Script Host with minimal changes in each environment:

      Dim oServer
      Set oServer = GetObject("IIS://LocalHost/W3SVC")
      oServer.PasswordCacheTTL = 0
      oServer.SetInfo
      Set oServer = Nothing

Please note: This procedure affects all Web server instances and decreases server
performance; it is intended for debugging purposes only.
