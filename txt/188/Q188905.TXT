TITLE   :FIX: Sharing a File from Command Line Causes Corruption
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe500bug kbSSafe600fix kbAnalyze kbSSafeAnalyze

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After running Analyze.exe with the -f switch, you may find the following message
in the Analyze.log file:

   The project <Project Name> contains a child that does not recognize
   this project as a parent. The child will be added to the project.

CAUSE
=====

A file is shared to a project that contains a shared and deleted copy of the
same file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Avoid sharing a file from the command line when the file contains a deleted link
to the target project. If you want to share the file, either recover the file or
purge the shared file and share it again.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been corrected in Visual
SourceSafe 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Assume that you have a file named $/Proj1/File1 and a project named $/Proj2.
File1 is shared from Proj1 to Proj2, then deleted (not destroyed) from Proj2. If
you try to share the file again from the SourceSafe explorer, the following
error occurs:

   A deleted link to File1.txt already exists ...

Sharing the file from the command does not create an error, but Analyze displays
the following error:

   The project Proj2 contains a child that does not recognize this project as a
   parent. The child will be added to the project.


Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create two projects and name them $/Proj1 and $/Proj2.

2. Add a file named File1.txt to $/Proj1 .

3. Right-click project Proj2 and then from the Context menu, choose Share.

4. In the Share dialog box, select the file File1 under $/Proj1.

5. Click Share, and then click OK.

6. Delete the file, File1.txt from $/Proj2.

7. Repeat steps 3-5.

8. The following error message appears:

   A deleted link to File1.txt already exists.

9. From the command prompt, run the following commands:

   ss cp $/proj2
   ss share $/proj1/File1.txt

   The files share and no error occurs.
