TITLE   :WD97: "Header Record Delimiters" Appears Repeatedly in Merge
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word97 kbmerge

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a single field data file is in a paragraph delimited form, the dialog box

   Header Record Delimiters

will appear at several points during the mail merge process. The default field
delimiter is displayed as [none]. To properly close this dialog box, leave the
settings as they are displayed and click OK.

NOTE: The information in this article applies only to data files that consist of
a single field. If this dialog box appears when using a data file with two or
more fields, there is an error in the header record.

CAUSE
=====

This dialog box is prompting you to select the character to separate fields and
records in the data file. For example, in many multiple-field data files, a
comma is used to separate each field and a paragraph (hard carriage return) is
used to separate each record. In the case of a single field data file, there is
no field separator.

This dialog box appears every time the data file is read during the mail merge
process. For example, the dialog box may appear in any of the following
situations:

 - Immediately after you select the data file name from the Mail Merge Helper
   Attach Data File dialog box.

 - After you click OK in the Data Form Window.

 - After you close a file opened in View Source mode.

Click OK to remove this dialog box from the screen in all of these cases.
Clicking Cancel may cause Word to open the source file in View Source mode.

If you open the data file in View Source mode immediately after you cancel the
Header Record Delimiters message, click the file and click Yes when prompted to
save the changes. Clicking No and canceling the Header Record Delimiters message
breaks the link between the data file and main document.

WORKAROUND
==========

To convert the data file to a single column table, follow these steps:

1. Open the data file.

2. On the Edit menu, click Select All.

3. On the Table menu, click Convert Text To Table.

4. Set Number Of Columns to 1 and set Separate Text At to Paragraph.

5. Click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
