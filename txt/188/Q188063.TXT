The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Package Command Manager (PCM) as a service cannot be used to distribute and run
the Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 3 upgrade.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use PCM as a service, you must use the Package setup to set the package to
run as Automated Command Line and System Background Task. For this to function,
the program must NOT require user input of any kind. The setup program employed
by Systems Management Server to apply service pack upgrades does not support the
use of silent or unattended installations. Therefore, it is not possible to
update a primary site to Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 3 by means
of the PCM service. You must use PCM as an application, and it will require user
interaction to install successfully.
