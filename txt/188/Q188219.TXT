Changes to ASP files may not take effect if ASP file caching is turned off. ASP

files on the Process Options tab in the Application Configuration property
sheet. It can also be turned off by selecting the property sheet for the
computer name. Select WWW Service from the Master Properties list box and then
click Edit. On the Home Directory tab, click Configuration. On the Process
Options tab, select the Do not cache ASP files check box. The Process Options
tab is available only if the "Run in Separate Memory" option is checked on the
Home Directory tab of the property sheet.

CAUSE
=====

The Script Engine cache and Template cache are not synched properly.


RESOLUTION
