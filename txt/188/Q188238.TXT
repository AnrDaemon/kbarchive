======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Server Manage Agent service (MngAgent.exe) may generate an application
exception error when APPC sessions are not properly cleaned up. When this
problem occurs, the Windows NT Application Event Log will contain a message
similar to the following:

   Event ID: 624
   Source: SNA Server
   Description: Creating dump file C:\SNA\traces\snadump.log for
   mngagent.exe

If Drwtsn32.exe is the default debugger on the computer running Windows NT Server
and SNA Server, an entry similar to the following will be included in the
drwtsn32.log in the Windows NT directory:

   Application exception occurred:
      App: exe\mngagent.dbg (pid=<process ID #>)
      When: <date> @ <time>
      Exception number: c0000005 (access violation)


CAUSE
=====

Partner APPC sessions are not being cleaned up properly when SNA Server receives
notification from a client to close an APPC session. This eventually leads to
the application exception error.
