TITLE   :XFOR: Application Error With Multipart/Alternative Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the Internet Mail Service is configured so that outbound messages containing
attachments are encoded using Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME), an
application error similar to the following may occur if a message with a content
type of multipart/alternative causes a non-delivery report (NDR) to be sent:

   The instruction at "0x00439585" referenced memory at "0xcccccc34". The
   memory could not be "read".

CAUSE
=====

When the Internet Mail Service is configured in this manner, the NDR is encoded
using MIME. The header of the original message is used to encode the NDR, but
the message body is not used. This causes a problem when the original message
has a content type of multipart/alternative.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
