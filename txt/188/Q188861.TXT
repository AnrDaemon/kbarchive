TITLE   :HOWTO: Use the Remote Data Control to Pass Bookmarks
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows

KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If two RemoteData controls (RDCs) have the same result set, they can use the
same bookmark.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample uses two forms, each with its own RDC, to demonstrate that
one RDC can use the bookmark set on the result set of another RDC. If you set a
bookmark to the result set of the RDC on Form1, you can use the same bookmark
for the result set of the RDC on Form2. The RDC on Form2 opens the result set
and points to the same record that was saved to the bookmark.

NOTE: Each RDC must have the same SQL property or the bookmark does not work.
Also, each RDC must be bound to the same source in the DataSourceName property.

Steps to Create Sample
----------------------

1. Open a Standard EXE project in Visual Basic.

2. Add a form so that you have Form1 and Form2 in your project.

3. Add a RemoteData control to Form1 and another one to Form2.

4. Add a TextBox control to Form1 and another one to Form2

5. Create a Microsoft Access DataSourceName for the Northwind database in the
   ODBC Administrator. Set the DataSourceName property for each of the RDCs to
   your Northwind DataSource. Set the SQL property for each of the RDCs to the
   following:

         Select * From Customers

6. Set the DataSource property for each TextBox control to MSRDC1.

7. Create a Command button on form1. Paste in the following code:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
           Dim varBookmark As Variant

           varBookmark = Form1.MSRDC1.Resultset.Bookmark
           Form2.MSRDC1.Resultset.Bookmark = varBookmark
           Form2.Show
         End Sub
