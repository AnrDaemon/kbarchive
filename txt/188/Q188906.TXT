TITLE   :PRB: No Command Line Equivalent for Move...File
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:_IK kbSSafe600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use the Visual SourceSafe Move command on the command line,
providing the path to a file in a SourceSafe project, the following message
appears:

   This command only works on projects.

CAUSE
=====

The Move command is designed to move Projects only, not move files.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A new feature in Visual SourceSafe is the ability to move files from one project
to another. This operation is available in the graphical user interface in the
"Move..." command under the File menu. There is not a command line equivalent
for the command.

The user can move a file from one project to another in Visual SourceSafe by
selecting the file and choosing the "Move..." command located under the File
menu. When you move a file this way, the file is shared to the destination
project, and then deleted but not purged from the source project.

To move a file from one project to another utilizing the command line, you use
the SourceSafe CP, SHARE and DELETE commands. For example, to move the
Myfile.txt file from $/source to $/destination, execute the following commands:

   SS CP $/destination
   SS SHARE $/source/myfile.txt
   SS DELETE $/source/myfile.txt
