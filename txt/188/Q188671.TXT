======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how an Exchange administrator can determine when
permissions have been modified on the Organization, Site, or Configuration
objects in the Exchange Administrator program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following event appears in the application log of the event viewer after an
administrator has modified the permissions on one of these objects:

   Event ID 1175
   Source  MSExchangeDS
   Type  Information
   Category  Security

With the following descriptions:

 - If the change is made at the Organizational level: Description: The Security
   attributes of object /o=<Organization Name> were modified.

 - If the change is made at the Site level: Description: The Security attributes
   of object /o=<Organization Name>/ou=<Site Name> were modified.

 - If the change is made at the Configuration level: Description: The Security
   attributes of object /o=<Organization Name>/ou=<Site
   Name>/cn=Configuration were modified.

With diagnostic logging set to Maximum on "Security" in the properties of
Directory Service/Diagnostic Logging, the following event is logged:

   Event ID 1053
   Source MSExchangeDS
   Type Information
   Category Security

With the following descriptions:

 - If the change is made at the Organizational level: Description: The security
   descriptor granted 0x80 access on object /o=<Organization Name> for
   this user.

 - If the change is made at the Site level: Description: The security descriptor
   granted 0x80 access on object /o=<Organization Name>/ou=<Site
   Name> for this user.

 - If the change is made at the Configuration level: Description: The security
   descriptor granted 0x80 access on object /o=<Organization
   Name>/ou=<Site Name>/cn=Configuration for this user.

In the previous Events, "admin" permissions were granted to a user; this equals
"0x80" in the description. This number varies depending on which permissions
were modified.

The description does not state which user made the modification to the objects;
however, in the application log under the USER column, it states which user
caused the event to be generated.
