TITLE   :Random Stop 0x50 Errors on Cirrus Video Adapters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

On systems with some Cirrus-compatible video adapters, Windows NT may randomly
and infrequently stop responding (hang) and report the following blue screen
error message:

   STOP 0x00000050 error
   PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA.

CAUSE
=====

The GDI in Windows NT requires 8-byte alignment on the bitmaps it is expected to
draw on. Cirrus's driver provides 4-byte alignment instead of 8. This may cause
problems on some video adapters where output requests are delivered to GDI.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
