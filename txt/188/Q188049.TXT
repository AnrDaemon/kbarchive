======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Account Changer utility (Acctchg.exe) changes the information that Systems
Management Server services use to access the SQL Server database. Acctchg.exe,
included in the BackOffice Resource Kit, affects only the services on the
specified site server. Account Changer does not make any changes to SQL Server
itself; this must be done manually while running Account Changer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To change the Systems Management Server account information, perform the
following steps:

1. Run Acctchg.exe and specify a site server. ACCTCHG shuts down that site and
   waits.

2. Use SQL Server tools to make whatever changes you need. For example, change
   the SQL Server account and password, rename the Systems Management Server
   database, or move the database to another SQL Server computer.

3. Resume ACCTCHG by returning focus to the window that is running ACCTCHG and
   press any key.

4. ACCTCHG prompts you for the following information to be used from now on by
   the Systems Management Server services in the specified site:

    - SQL Server name

    - SQL Server database name

    - SQL Server account

    - SQL Server password

5. ACCTCHG restarts the site.

Acctchg.exe runs on: Alpha, MIPS, x86.
