The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you paste or paste link a large Microsoft Excel spreadsheet in a Microsoft
Word document, Word may not include all the columns or rows of the spreadsheet.

CAUSE
=====

By design, when you paste or paste link the spreadsheet in a format other than
Rich Text Format (RTF), Word cuts off the columns and rows that exceed the
margins of the current page.

In other words, if you paste or paste link the spreadsheet in any of the
following formats, Word cuts off any columns and rows that exceed the right and
bottom margins:

 - Microsoft Excel 5.0 Worksheet Object

 - Unformatted Text

 - Picture

 - Bitmap


WORKAROUND
==========

If your Microsoft Excel spreadsheet exceeds the margins of your current page and
you do not want Word to cut off any columns or rows, paste or paste link it in
RTF file format. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the Edit menu, click Paste Special.

2. In the As box, select Formatted Text (RTF).

3. Select the Paste or Paste Link option, and then click OK.

NOTE: If the spreadsheet fits on the current page but not within the margins, you
may be able to paste the entire spreadsheet as an object by decreasing the
margin settings for that section. For example, if Word is cutting off only one
column of your spreadsheet, change the left and right margins from 1 inch to 0.5
inch.
