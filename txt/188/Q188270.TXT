TITLE   :FP97: Cannot View Global IP Restrictions in FrontPage Explorer
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q194282.

SYMPTOMS
========

The global IP restrictions on the server are not listed on the Computers tab in
the Permissions dialog box (click Permissions on the Tools menu).

NOTE: This behavior only occurs in FrontPage when using Microsoft Internet
Information Server versions 3.0 and earlier. All the NCSA derivatives accurately
display IP restrictions.

CAUSE
=====

The information that appears in the Permissions dialog box is pulled from the
Svcac1.cnf file. The global IP restrictions of the Web servers are stored in the
server's configuration file rather than the Svcac1.cnf file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
