TITLE   :SMS: Program Group Control Logs "Fatal error!" Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbPGC smspgc

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Program Group Control reports the following error in the Pgc.log file of a
client:

   Program Group Control ==> Fatal error! NNP Not running

CAUSE
=====

Program Group Control requires that the Network Naming Provider (Nnp.exe) be
loaded on a Systems Management Server Windows 95 client.

WORKAROUND
==========

Check the registry entry on the Win95 machine under the

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\RunServices
   \<drive>:\Ms\Sms\Bin\Nnp.exe

registry key that loads this executable file. Also ensure that this file exists
in the specified path.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Systems Management Server Client installation creates this registry entry. You
may have to restart the client computer for this to be loaded.

Network Naming Provider (NNP) is a system application (running at Ring 3) that
provides the non-real time component of the Systems Management Server Router.
NNP loads at boot time, reads the system registry for Systems Management Server
information, formats that information, and passes it to the Logical Network
Redirector (LNR). In addition, NNP verifies server and share status as needed,
and updates the information for LNR.

In Systems Management Server 1.2, Windows 95 introduced the NNP to dynamically
choose a distribution server. If the distribution server is unavailable, another
distribution server is chosen.
