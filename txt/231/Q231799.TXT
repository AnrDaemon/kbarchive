SYMPTOMS
========

An originator who sends a MIME message with Outlook Express through an
administrative management domain (ADMD) to an Exchange Server 5.5 SP1 computer
receives a non-delivery report (NDR). The following events are also logged in
the application event log:

   Event ID: 290
   Type: Warning
   Description: NDR generated, reason code unable-to-transfer and diagnostic code
   content-syntax-error.

   Event ID: 62
   Type: Warning
   Description: A delivery failure occurred to the message...

   Event ID: 210
   Type: Warning
   Description: Content conversion from 56010A01 (P2-88) to 2A864886F7140501
   (MDBEF).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is due to problems in the way that Exchange Server handles general
text body parts.
