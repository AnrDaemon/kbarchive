TITLE   :XFOR: New Internet Mail Service Feature for Setting Size Limit
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFEA exc55sp1 exc55sp2 EXC55SP3Fea

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 Service Packs 1, 2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Internet Mail Service enables setting the same Inbound and Outbound size
restrictions.

The current behavior is by design. Currently, the product enables for a size
limit to be set for the Exchange Server Internet Mail Service that is used for
both incoming and outgoing messages. A new feature was added to enable
administrators to control the size of incoming and outgoing messages
independently.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This feature is available in the latest service pack for Exchange Server version
5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this feature should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Internet Mail Service

+-------------------------+
| File name    | Version  | 
+-------------------------+
| Msexcimc.exe | 5.5.2591 | 
+-------------------------+

This feature was first included in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3.


The combination of two new registry settings, and an update to the Exchange
Server Internet Mail Server, may implement the new feature.

The registry setting used to re-map the attribute is:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters

Value: OutboundSizeLimit REG_DWORD and Value: InboundSizeLimit REG_DWORD.

These values are set in bytes, which is not the same way the "Message Size" is
set in the Exchange Server Administrator program. The Exchange Server
Administrator program "Message Size" is set in (K).

Please note that the new feature should not be used in coordination with the
previous limit settings found on the General tab of the Internet Mail Service
Property page of the Administrator program. Before you implement this feature,
set the Message Size option to No Limit. The registry settings should take
precedence, but in some cases, the size limitation may not be applied as
expected. If only one limit is being used for either Outbound or Inbound, it is
recommended that you create both registry values with a value. A setting of 0
indicates no limit. The maximum registry value allowed is 4,294,967,295.
