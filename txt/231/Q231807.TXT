TITLE   :WD97: Wildcard Calculates Search and Replace Text Improperly
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you find or replace text using wildcard criteria of any character occurring
from n to m occurrences (?{n,m}), Word may find or replace text that exceeds m.

In the text example:

   sample a 123
   sample ab 123
   sample abc 123
   sample abcd 123

to find all occurrences of text beginning with the word "Sample ", followed by
just one to three characters and ending with " 123", you would build a wildcard
search criteria of:

   Sample (?{1,3})( 123)

in the Find what box (in the Find and Replace dialog box on the Edit menu).

This criteria, however, will find the last line in the example above, which
contains more than three characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
