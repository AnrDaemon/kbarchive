TITLE   :MapPoint 2000: Data Import Wizard Assigns ZIP Heading to Column
PRODUCT :Microsoft Automap
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbui kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MapPoint 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Data Import wizard in Microsoft MapPoint 2000 may incorrectly assign the ZIP
heading to a column that does not contain zip codes.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if either of the following conditions are true:

 - The imported data includes only one column of all five-digit numbers, and
   this column does not contain zip codes.

 - The imported data includes more than one column of all five-digit numbers,
   and the first such column does not contain zip codes.

NOTE: MapPoint 2000 automatically assigns the ZIP heading to the first column of
data that contains all five-digit numbers.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, manually change the column heading in the Data Import
wizard. To do this:

1. On the File menu, click Import Data.

2. Click to select the document you want, and then click Open.

   NOTE: If the document you want to open is a Microsoft Excel workbook, click
   the worksheet containing the data you want to import, and then click Next.

3. Click a pre-defined heading in the heading box, or type the heading you want
   in the heading box.

4. Click Finish.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft MapPoint 2000.
