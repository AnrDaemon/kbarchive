-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After installing Service Pack 4 for NT 4.0 you may temporarily lose the Paste
functionality of the Visual C++ editor. The copied text can be seen in the
Clipboard when this problem occurs. This problem is intermittent.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may be due to the changes in the heap manager allocation pattern
after installing NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4).

RESOLUTION
==========

You can add the Visual C++ executable, MSDEV.exe, to the Image File Execution
Options list in the registry. See the directions in the Resolution section of
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q195009 Application Access Violation or Hang After Applying SP4

Adding MSDEV.exe to this list causes the SP4 heap manager to revert to SP3 and
earlier allocation patterns for Visual C++. This has been shown to fix the paste
problems some users experience.
