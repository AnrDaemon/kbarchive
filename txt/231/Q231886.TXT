SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Bring Your Own Transaction (BYOT), the import transaction may fail
with XACT_E_TIP_PULL_FAILED. The following message may be logged in event
viewer:

   The BYOT Gateway failed to import the transaction using Transaction Internet
   Protocol (TIP). Make sure that the installed DTC supports the TIP protocol.

   Server Application ID : {A20B779B-03F6-11D3-926A-00C04F8EF295}
   Server Application Name : server_name
   Error Code = 0x8004d021 :
   COM+ Services Internals Information :
   File: .\byotex.cpp, Line: 105

CAUSE
=====

This error is misleading because import transaction can fail even if Microsoft
Distributed Coordinator (MS DTC) supports Transaction Internet Protocol (TIP).

This error is returned when a PULLED command is sent to the Transaction Manager
(TM), and the TM sends back a NOTPULLED token. Any TM that is TIP-compliant can
send a NOTPULLED token. A TM can return this token if for any reason the Pull
relationship is not established. For additional information, see the "More
Information" section to follow.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MS DTC returns a NOTPULLED token under the following circumstances:

 - The Transaction identifier (TrID) that is included in the PULL command is not
   valid. TIP specification does not define a format for TrID. Each TM defines
   its own TrID. For MS DTC, the valid TrID should comply with the following
   format:

   oletx-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

   which is 43 characters long (including terminal NULL).

 - The application was badly designed. The transaction was committed before the
   complete transaction tree was set up.

 - The specified TrID is not in the list for the active transactions. As a
   result, the transaction is stopped or timed out.

Additional query words: error 0x8004d021
