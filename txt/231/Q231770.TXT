======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual C++ 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After successfully installing the Windows CE Toolkit for Visual C++ 6.0, the
AppWizards for generating Windows CE projects are not listed in the New Project
dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows CE Toolkit for Visual C++ 6.0 setup may incorrectly install files if
the Visual Studio \COMMON directory and the Visual C++ \VC98 directory are
located under different parent directories.

During the installation of any Visual Studio product, the user will be required
to specify the location where Visual Studio common files are to be installed.
During the Visual C++ install, the user will then be additionally required to
specify the location where Visual C++-specific files are to be installed. If the
user specifies a different parent directory for \COMMON and \VC98, the product
may not install correctly. The symptom described above is a result of the
Windows CE AppWizard files (*.awx) being installed in an incorrect directory.

In a default installation, the files would be stored in the following location:

   <System-Drive>:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual
   Studio\Common\MSDev98\Bin\IDE

RESOLUTION
==========

Workaround #1:

Uninstall and re-install Visual C++ to reside in the same parent directory as the
Visual Studio Common directory. This is the preferred solution.

Workaround #2:

Locate the directory that contains the following files in the Visual Studio
directory structure:

   cedllwz.awx
   ceexewz.awx
   celibwz.awx
   wceapwz.awx
   wceatl.awx
   wcedlwz.awx
   wcectl.awx

If the setup program executed correctly, these files will be located in the
following directory:

   <drive>:<Visual Studio-root>\Common\MSDev98\Bin\IDE

If the files are not located in this directory, copy the entire contents of the
incorrect directory to this correct location.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
