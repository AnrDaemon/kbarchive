SYMPTOMS
========

When you use file compression utilities to reduce the storage size of Word
documents that contain a large percentage of graphics, the compression ratio may
be lower than expected.


CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Word is designed to compress the pictures or graphics inserted into
documents automatically. Word natively stores JPEG images and converts all
raster formats to Portable Network Graphics (PNG). PNG is a compressed format.

Applying additional compression to well-compressed images does not yield a
significant reduction in the amount of storage space. Only non-JPEG/PNG data
like text and other data can be reduced by a compression algorithm.
