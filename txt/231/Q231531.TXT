The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MapPoint 2000 
 - Microsoft MapPoint 2001 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to save a Microsoft MapPoint mao as a Web page to a network
server, you may receive the following error message:

   You don't have permission to save files in this location. If you are
   attempting to save to a floppy disk, verify that the disk is not
   write-protected.

NOTE: Because you can save a folder in MapPoint to the server without receiving
this error message, you do have permission to save files and folders to the
server.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if your network operating system does not support long
file names.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
