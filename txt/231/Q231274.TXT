======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you search for files on a Macintosh client computer, the computer may
temporarily stop responding (hang). This behavior occurs even though the
CatSearch function is disabled on the Macintosh volume the client is searching.

CAUSE
=====

The Macintosh client may be running an AppleScript that requests a CatSearch,
even though the CatSearch function is disabled.

When the CatSearch function is disabled on a Macintosh volume, the information is
passed to Macintosh clients when volume parameters are passed, and the clients
do not search volumes by requesting a CatSearch. Instead, they perform an
Enumerate request. However, Macintosh clients can run an AppleScript that
overrides the information passed to the client so the client can request a
CatSearch.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, alter or remove the AppleScript.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can verify whether or not the Macintosh client is using the CatSearch
function by performing a network trace during the slowness between the Macintosh
client and the Windows NT Server-based computer hosting the Macintosh volume.
