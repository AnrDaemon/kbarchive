TITLE   :Raptor CIFS Firewall Disables Access to Network Monitor Agents
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms120 kbNetMon

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When it is running on Sparc/Solaris, Network Monitor 4.0 cannot connect to a
remote agent through an agent's Raptor version 5.0.3 firewall.

CAUSE
=====

Raptor 5 includes a new proxy service called Common Internet File System, or
CIFS (also known as SMB), to handle NetBIOS traffic. This advanced proxy
provides fine control to administrators over the kind of NetBIOS traffic that is
allowed (files, printers, read-only, and so on), and provides better logging.

The CIFS proxy, however, does not understand Network Monitor's remote agent
connections. Network Monitor stops responding (hangs) when it attempts the
connection to the remote agent, even though there may be a rule permitting CIFS
traffic.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, reconfigure the Raptor firewall to use compatible
proxy services:

1. Disable the new CIFS proxy.

2. Define a generic service proxy (GSP service) on TCP port 139.

3. Use this new service instead of CIFS proxy in your rules.

4. Restart the firewall.
