TITLE   :SMS: Canned Queries Do Not Complete
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbQuery kbsms200sp2fixkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you execute a canned query, such as 'All Systems' and 'All Client Systems'
that are included in Systems Management Server 2.0, the query may fail to
complete.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because these queries create very large temporary tables in
the tempdb database. If the table runs out of space, the queries do not
complete.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This hotfix can be used for both Systems Management Server 2.0 and Service Pack
1 sites. To install the hotfix, follow these steps:

1. Stop the Systems Management Server Site Component Manager and Systems
   Management Server Executive services on the Systems Management Server site
   server.
