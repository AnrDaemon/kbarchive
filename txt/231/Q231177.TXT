TITLE   :BUG: Permission Denied Error by Building From PWB
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER:winnt:6.11,6.11a,6.11c,6.11d,6.12,6.13,6.14

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.11, 6.11a, 6.11c, 6.11d, 6.12, 6.13, 6.14 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The first time an assembler project is built in the Programmer's Workbench
(PWB), there are no problems. Subsequent attempts to build the project cause an
error similar to the following:

   file.$c\temp\pw02681.msg permission denied

CAUSE
=====

PWB is a MS-DOS application that does not work properly when run on Windows 95
and later.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the problem, select DOS Shell from the PWB file menu and build
your project by using the NMAKE utility as the following code illustrates:

   Syntax: "nmake /fMyProject.mak"

You may also be able to work around the problem with one of the following
methods:

1. Use the real-mode version of NMAKE, the Nmaker.exe file. First, locate
   Nmake.exe in the \Bin directory under the root Macro Assembler (MASM)
   installation directory. Then rename Nmake.exe to Nmakep.exe, and rename
   Nmaker.exe to Nmake.exe. The protect-mode version of NMAKE can still be
   accessed using Nmakep.exe.

2. Use a 32-bit version of the Nmake.exe file, such as the versions included
   with Visual C++ 32-bit Editions.

   For Visual C++, NMAKE can typically be found in the \Bin directory under the
   root Visual C++ installation directory. Copy Nmake.exe from the Visual C++
   \Bin directory to the MASM \Bin directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
