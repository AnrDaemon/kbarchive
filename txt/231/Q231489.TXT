PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0; winnt:1.2,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug smsinst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the "Install File(s)" or "Copy Local File(s)" script items and you
specify a source by using wildcards, Systems Management Server Installer may
request a reboot even if the files being copied are not in use.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use any of the following methods:

 - Obtain the latest version of Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer
   from the following Microsoft Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/smsmgmt/downloads/

 - Set the RESTART variable to a null value at the end of the installation
   script to prevent the restart requirement by using the "Set Variable" script
   item.

 - Instead of using wildcards with the "Install File(s)" or "Copy Local File(s)"
   script items, use individual script items for each file to be replaced.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior does not occur when you use the latest version of Systems
Management Server Installer. It occurs only if you attempt to install files in a
folder that has files in use. If the destination folder is empty or does not
contain files that are in use, the restart request is not generated. Typically,
Systems Management Server Installer marks these files to be replaced at the next
reboot and prompts you to restart the computer at the end of the installation.
You can control this activity by using the RESTART variable.
