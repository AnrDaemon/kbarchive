KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbinterop kbtool kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MapPoint 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to link or import data from a Microsoft Excel workbook to
Microsoft MapPoint 2000, you may receive the following error message:

   Only 1000 records may be placed at one time using Street Address.

When you click OK, the remaining records in the workbook are not mapped.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if both of the following conditions are true:

 - The Excel workbook from which you link or import data contains more than 1000
   records.

 - The records you link or import include street addresses.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, use either of the following methods:

 - Make sure the workbook from which you link or import data contains a maximum
   of 1000 records.

 - Do not include street addresses in the records you link or import.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can map all records in a workbook that contains over 1000 records by using
geographic information that is less specific than street addresses, such as ZIP
codes.

Additional query words: mp2000 many over exceeds limit
