TITLE   :Netdde.exe Does Not Relay WM_DDE_TERMINATE to Remote Clients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4,4.0 SP5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a remote client in a Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) conversation with a server
computer running Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 or 5 sends WM_DDE_TERMINATE to
the server, Netdde.exe does not relay the server's WM_DDE_TERMINATE response
back to the remote client.

In addition to causing the client to never receive WM_DDE_TERMINATE, this also
has the undesirable effect of leaving child windows orphaned.
