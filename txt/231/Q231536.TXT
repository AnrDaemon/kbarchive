TITLE   :MapPoint 2000: Unable to Save More than One Map to Floppy Disk
PRODUCT :Microsoft Automap
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MapPoint 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to save a Microsoft MapPoint 2000 map to a floppy disk, you may
receive the following error message:

   The disk is full. Please delete unneeded files or save your map to another
   disk or drive.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you attempt to save more than one map as a Web page
to the same floppy disk.

NOTE: You receive this message even if sufficient space remains on on the floppy
disk to store the additional map.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, save only one map to a floppy disk when you save a
map as a Web page.

If you want to save multiple maps to the same floppy disk, you must save the
additional maps in the MapPoint Map or Map Template formats.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft MapPoint 2000.
