KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbtool kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MapPoint 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you link or import currency data from a Microsoft Excel workbook to
Microsoft MapPoint 2000, the currency data may be sorted improperly in the Data
Mapping wizard.

In addition, data tips (shaded areas or circles) that represent currency data may
be improperly shaded on the map and improperly sorted in the map legend.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if one or more cells in a column of currency data in the
workbook are not formatted as currency.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, format the entire column of currency data in the workbook
as currency before you import or link the data to MapPoint 2000. To do this:

1. Start Excel.

2. Open the workbook from which you want to link or import data to MapPoint
   2000.

3. Click the worksheet that contains the data you want to link or import.

4. Select the column that contains the currency data.

5. On the Format menu, click Cells.

6. On the Number tab, click Currency in the Category box.

7. Click OK.
