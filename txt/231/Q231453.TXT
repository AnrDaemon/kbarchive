   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to post a form through ASP to a Microsoft IIS 4.0 computer with
Internet Explorer 5.0 and session variables used in the POST to the server, the
session variables may not display in the browser, as in previous versions of
Internet Explorer .

CAUSE
=====

Internet Explorer 5.0 has added a feature called NTLM pre-authorization. When an
Internet Explorer 5.0 browser connects to an IIS 4.0 Web site that uses NTLM
security, Internet Explorer 5.0 negotiates security. If an NTLM challenge is
received, these credentials are used for any subsequent request for that Web
site. In this case, when an Internet Explorer 5.0 browser connects, it receives
an NTLM challenge, but when a sub folder on the same Web site does not use NTLM,
no challenge is received by Internet Explorer 5.0, which causes the browser to
not send the POST data to the server.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\InternetSettings

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

   Value Name: DisableNTLMPreAuth
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Value: 1

4. Quit Registry Editor.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem only occurs when you use Internet Explorer to connect to an IIS 4.0
computer where NTLM security is placed on the parent virtual directory and
anonymous security is placed on any sub directory below the parent directory.

Additional query words: preauth
