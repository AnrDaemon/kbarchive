SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to give users local administrative privileges on
their workstation using User Manager for Domains.

MORE INFORMATION
================

User Manager for Domains lets you grant these permissions without visiting each
workstation. On the server (or on a workstation with server tools loaded):

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools (Common), and
   then click "User Manager for Domains".

2. On the User menu bar, click Select Domain.

3. In the Domain box, type "\\<ComputerName>" (without the quotation
   marks) (where <ComputerName> is the name of the computer), and then
   click OK. This starts User Manager for Domains for the computer name you
   specified.

4. Double-click Administrators in the list of groups at the bottom of the "User
   Manager for Domains" dialog box.

5. In the Local Groups Properties dialog box, click Add. In the List Names From
   box (these are the domains in which you can add users from), click the user
   (or global group) that needs administrative rights, and then click Add. The
   user name is displayed in the Names box. Click OK.

6. In the Local Group Policies dialog box, click OK.

When you give users local administrative privileges on their workstation, they
are still ordinary users in the domain, but are simultaneously an Administrator
on their computer running Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server.
