STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in LinkAge Message Exchange 3.2.
This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To implement the different settings to disable meeting request support, obtain
the hotfix mentioned above. Then, modify the Exchconn.ini file and add the
following line:

   "MtgRequestSupport = No" (without the quotation marks)

When the parameter is placed under the [LME] section, it turns off meeting
request support for both the Exchange PROFS Connector and the Exchange Notes
Connector.

When the parameter is placed under the [LME-PROFS] section, it does not turn off
meeting request support for the Exchange Notes Connector.

When the parameter is in place, all meeting objects such as
Accept/Tentative/Decline responses are downgraded to normal messages. When the
parameter is set to YES or does not exist, functionality is not changed.

The INI parameter/switch is for both Notes and PROFS. The switch can be turned on
specifically for a particular connector, depending on the location of the
parameter in the INI file. For example:

   [LME]
   MtgRequestSupport = No

This will turn off all meeting request support for ALL connectors.

   [LME-PROFS]
   MtgRequestSupport = No

In this case, only the Exchange PROFS Connector maps a meeting request to a
normal message, and if there is an Exchange Notes Connector running on the same
computer, the Exchange Notes Connector still supports the meeting request
properly.
