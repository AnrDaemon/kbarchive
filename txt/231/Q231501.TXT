TITLE   :MapPoint 2000: Cannot Find Address Located on Numbered Street
PRODUCT :Microsoft Automap
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MapPoint 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to find an address located on a numbered street using Microsoft
MapPoint 2000, you may receive the following error message:

   No match was found. Check the spelling of the address and type it again.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you type the street name using a cardinal number, as
in the following example:

   1000 42 Street

NOTE: This error message can also indicate that the address you typed does not
exist in the program's database.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, type the street name using an ordinal number, as in the
following example:

   1000 42nd Street

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because numbered street names use ordinal numbers, you must add a suffix to the
street name. An example of each suffix and a corresponding street name is listed
in the following table.

+--------------------------------------------------+
| Street name | Suffix | Corresponding street name | 
+--------------------------------------------------+
| 21 Street   | st     | 21st Street               | 
+--------------------------------------------------+
| 42 Street   | nd     | 42nd Street               | 
+--------------------------------------------------+
| 63 Street   | rd     | 63rd Street               | 
+--------------------------------------------------+
| 96 Street   | th     | 96th Street               | 
+--------------------------------------------------+
