======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Program Group Control (PGC) Migration Wizard, the resulting
program name may be truncated, in which case you receive the following error
message:

   error occurred while committing data to WMI: WBEM_E_FAILED

The following message is reported in the Smsprov.log file:

   The program name must be at least 1 and less than 50 characters in length.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if the program name exceeds the maximum 50-character limit,
which results in an incomplete program migration.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, ensure that when you create program names, they
are within the character limit of 1 to 50 characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
