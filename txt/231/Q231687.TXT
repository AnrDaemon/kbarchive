PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5

KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to change the display name of GroupWise users as they appear in
the Microsoft Exchange Server global address list. This article explains how to
change the display name to be in the format of LastName, FirstName. By default,
the GroupWise custom recipients are displayed in the format of FirstName,
LastName.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default in Exchange Server, users are displayed in the global address list in
the format of FirstName, LastName. In GroupWise, users appear in the address
book as LastName, FirstName. For this reason, you may want to change the way the
GroupWise users appear in the global address list to match the way they appear
in the GroupWise system.

To accomplish this, you need to modify the Mapgwise.tbl file, which is located in
the Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn\DxaGwise directory.

IMPORTANT: You should make a backup of the Mapgwise.tbl file before making any
changes to it. By default, the Mapgwise.tbl file appears as follows:

   TA = "GWISE:" DOMAIN "." POSTOFFICE "." OBJECT
   DN = DOMAIN "." POSTOFFICE "." OBJECT
   ALIAS = OBJECT
   FULLNAME = ISEQUAL(FIRSTNAME AND(" ", LASTNAME), "", ISEQUAL(FIRSTNAME, "",
   ISEQUAL(LASTNAME, "", OBJECT, LASTNAME), FIRSTNAME), TRIM(FIRSTNAME AND(" ",
   LASTNAME),"B"))
   FIRSTNAME = FIRSTNAME
   LASTNAME = LASTNAME
   DEPARTMENT = DEPARTMENT
   TITLE = TITLE
   PHONE = PHONE
   FAX = FAX
   SMTPADDR = SMTPALIAS

To change the display name to be LastName, FirstName, modify the file so that it
appears as follows:

   TA = "GWISE:" DOMAIN "." POSTOFFICE "." OBJECT
   DN = DOMAIN "." POSTOFFICE "." OBJECT
   ALIAS = OBJECT
   FULLNAME = ISEQUAL(LASTNAME FIRSTNAME, "" , OBJECT, TRIM(ISEQUAL(FIRSTNAME,
   "", LASTNAME, ISEQUAL(LASTNAME, "", FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME ", "
   FIRSTNAME)),"B"))
   FIRSTNAME = FIRSTNAME
   LASTNAME = LASTNAME
   DEPARTMENT = DEPARTMENT
   TITLE = TITLE
   PHONE = PHONE
   FAX = FAX

Stop and restart the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise. In the
Exchange Server Administrator program, in the Microsoft Exchange Connector for
Novell GroupWise Properties, click the Dirsynch Schedule tab. Click the
"Immediate Full Reload of GroupWise to Exchange Directory Synchronization"
option. You may want to do this during off-peak hours so that the impact on your
messaging environment is minimal.

The GroupWise users should now be in the format of LastName, FirstName.
