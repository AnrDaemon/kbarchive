SYMPTOMS
========

When you play Microsoft Midtown Madness on a Microsoft Windows 98-based computer
configured to use multiple monitors, Midtown Madness may attempt to redetect the
video adapters installed in the computer each time you start a game.

This behavior can occur if one or more video adapters installed in the computer
does not support Microsoft DirectDraw.

==========

You may be able to resolve this issue by installing the latest version of the
video driver available for each of your video adapters. Contact your hardware
manufacturer for information about how to obtain the latest video drivers for
