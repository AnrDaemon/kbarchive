The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After adding clients to a Systems Management Server site, administrators may
observe the following symptoms involving account lockouts and/or software
distribution failure:

 - Software distribution fails to domain controllers because the
   SMSCliToknAcct& domain account is locked out.

 - Software distribution fails to site systems that are not domain controllers
   because the SMSCliToknAcct& is locked out in the local accounts database.

 - The Systems Management Server Client Service fails to start on site systems
   that are not domain controllers because the SMSCliSvcAcct& account has
   been locked out.

 - The SMSCliToknAcct& in the domain is continually locked out.

 - The SMSCliToknAcct& on individual site systems that are not domain
   controllers is continually locked out.

 - The SMSCliSvcAcct& on individual site systems that are not domain
   controllers is continually locked out.

To work around this problem, disable account lockouts on the domain and on
individual site systems that are not domain controllers.


CAUSE
=====

The Systems Management Server Client services incorrectly attempts to use the
local SMSCliToknAcct& and the local SMSCliSvcAcct& credentials when
attempting to connect to site systems such as client access points (CAPs) or
distribution points.

On site systems that happen to be Systems Management Server clients and are not
domain controllers, both the SMSCliToknAcct& and SMSCliSvcAcct& accounts
exist in the local accounts database but have different passwords than those
similarly named accounts in the client's local accounts database. The continual
attempts by individual clients to connect with the client-specific accounts can
cause these two accounts to get locked out on the site systems as a result of
logon failures.

On site systems that are domain controllers, only one account with the same name
exists, the SMSCliToknAcct& account, which is shared among all the domain
controllers. If any of the domain controllers for a given domain are configured
as a client access point or distribution point, clients may incorrectly attempt
to use the local account credentials to access these site systems. This can
result in logon failures due to the password mismatch. Successive logon failures
can cause lockouts of the SMSCliToknAcct& domain account.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Systems Management Server 2.0.
This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack
Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SMSCliToknAcct& account is used to launch installations in several
specific situations:

 - The Run with administrative rights option is enabled for a program that isn't
   also configured to use the Windows NT client software installation account.

 - The program is set to run Whether or not a user is logged on and the program
   isn't configured to use the Windows NT client software installation account.

 - The program is set to run Only when no user is logged on and isn't configured
   to use the Windows NT client software installation account.

The Systems Management Server client service runs under the SMSCliSvcAcct&
account on Windows NT-based clients that are not domain controllers. On domain
controllers the client service runs under the context of a machine-specific
domain account named SMS&_<servername>. The SMSCliSvcAcct& account
lockout doesn't occur when using domain controllers as site systems because
there is not an account named SMSCliSvcAcct& automatically created on domain
controller clients.

This issue will not affect the majority of client systems in a site, only those
which are site systems or domain controllers.
