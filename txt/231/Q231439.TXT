   Category: None
   Server specific error 1276

NOTE: Error 1276 (0x4fc) refers to ecDomainError.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur when you reinstall Exchange Server if you use the display
name instead of the directory name that is used during a clean installation of
Exchange Server. This issue can also occur if you use a different organization
or site name instead of the names that were used in the original installation of
Exchange Server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, completely uninstall Exchange Server and then reinstall
Exchange Server by using the original directory name instead of the display name
for the organization and site. For additional information about how to remove
Exchange Server completely, click the article number below to view the article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q259158 XADM: How to Manually Remove Exchange Server 5.5 Completely

When you reinstall Exchange Server, always use the directory name instead of the
display name that is listed in the properties of the organization and site that
were used in the original installation of Exchange Server. In most cases, the
directory name and display name are the same. If they are different and you use
the display name, event ID 1088 is logged.

To verify the directory name if there is more than one server in the site or
organization, use the Exchange Server Administrator program to connect to one of
the Exchange Server computers and check the directory name for the organization
and site by clicking Properties on the File menu for both the Organization and
Site objects. Use these names to reinstall Exchange Server. Log on by using the
Exchange Server service account to reinstall Exchange Server.

To verify the directory name if there is only one server in the site or
organization, use the Exchange_Server_Setup.log file. This file is always
located in the root folder in which Exchange Server was originally installed and
is appended each time that Exchange Server is reinstalled or an Exchange Server
service pack is applied. If the logical drive for Exchange Server reinstallation
has changed, a new Exchange_Server_Setup.log file is created. Also, if the
entire logical folder or hard disk has been rebuilt, the
Exchange_Server_Setup.log file contains only the new information.

Use Notepad or another text editor to search the Exchange_Server_Setup.log file
for the first occurrence of the word "Creating." This section contains the
original organization, site, and computer name. Because the file is appended
each time that Setup is run, there may be multiple Setup details in the file.
