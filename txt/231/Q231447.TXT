SYMPTOMS
========

When you search for a file on your computer using the "Find Files or Folders" or
the "Search for Files or Folders" feature and you are searching by date, the
search may not work correctly.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if a file is dated earlier than 1/1/1980 or later than
12/31/2099. The search engine uses the MS-DOS date and time format, and because
it is limited to 2-digit dates, MS-DOS is limited to 100 years of dates and a
conversion is necessary. Dates earlier than 1980 are treated as being in the
twenty-first century (2000-2079). Dates between 2080 and 2099 are treated as
being in the twentieth century (1980-1999).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
