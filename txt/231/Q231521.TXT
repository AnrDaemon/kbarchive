PRODUCT :Microsoft Automap

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbtool kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MapPoint 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft MapPoint 2000 to display demographic data, the Microsoft
Excel workbook you create if you export the map to Excel may contain more data
than is displayed on the map.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if either of the following conditions are true:

 - You use the Data Mapping wizard to filter the data you want to display on the
   map.

 - You skip one or more columns of data when you import the data you want to
   display on the map.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, delete any column of data from the workbook that does
not contain demographic data portrayed on the map. To do this:

1. Select the column you want to delete.

2. On the Edit menu, click Delete. Repeat this step for each column you want to
   delete.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
