The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If users want to export a Visual Basic DataReport to an .Rtf file, they must use
automation. There is not a built-in option to send the report directly to this
file format. You can send a report to a .Txt file, and then use OLE automation
to save that file as a .Rtf file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Accomplish:

1. Create a Standard EXE Project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. From the Project menu, select Add Data Report and Add Data Environment.

3. In the DataEnvironment, create a Connection to the Nwind.MDB and add a
   command that uses the Customers table.

4. Drag-and-drop the CustomerID and CompanyName fields to the Detail Band of the
   DataReport.

5. Select the DataReport and, in the Properties sheet window, set the DataSource
   property to DataEnvironment1. Set the DataMember property to Command1.

6. Select Form1 and add a CommandButton. Change the Caption property to Show
   Report. In the Click event for the CommandButton, add the line:
   "DataReport1.Show." (without the quotation marks)

7. Add another CommandButton and change the Caption property to Export Report.
   Add the following code to the Click event:

       ' export report to TXT file
       DataReport1.ExportReport rptKeyText, "c:\Report\mytext1.txt"

       Dim obj As Object
       Set obj = CreateObject("Word.basic")
       obj.fileopen "c:\report\mytext1.txt"
       obj.FileSaveAs "c:\report\myrtf.rtf", 6
       Set obj = Nothing
       MsgBox "Your document was converted to RTF format"

8. Be sure that the folder "C:\Report" exists.

9. Press the F5 key to run the program. Click the Show Report button to see the
   information from the Customers table. Click the Export Report button to
   export to the .Txt file, and subsequently create the .Rtf file.
