=======

This article provides a list of tools you can use to simulate load for your Web
applications. By simulating load for your application, you can test concurrency
issues as well as better understand how your application behaves under stress.
Testing load and concurrency by refreshing a browser is not considered a valid
test.

With these tools you can stress test your Web server to see how it reacts when
several hundred users access your application at peak times. These tools can
also be used to test the server-side components for performance, locks, and
other scalability issues. A Web application that relies on databases can also be
tested on parameters such as concurrency, transactions, number of users, locks,
pooling, and so forth.
