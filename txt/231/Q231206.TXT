PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbtool kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the full version of the Network Monitor tool on a Microsoft
Windows 2000-based computer, the Network Monitor driver is not added to Local
Area Connection properties. Note that this problem does not occur unless you
install the full version of the Network Monitor tool.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if a Local Area Connection Properties dialog box is open
when you install the Network Monitor tool. The Network Monitor installation
program cannot automatically add the Network Monitor driver if this dialog box
is open.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

Method 1
--------

Verify that there are no Local Area Connection Properties dialog boxes open
before you install Network Monitor.

Method 2
--------

Install the Network Monitor driver again from the Local Area Connection
Properties dialog box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
