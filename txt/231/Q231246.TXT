======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Call DLL Function feature in Microsoft Systems Management
Server (SMS) Installer, which calls a certain function in a specified DLL, the
script may fail or cause the SMS Installer to stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

All DLL functions called by the SMS Installer script must be declared as
CALLBACK functions; otherwise, the Setup program may stop responding. Previous
versions of SMS Installer tolerated DLL functions that were not called as
CALLBACK functions. Therefore, it is possible that DLL functions that worked
correctly with previous versions of SMS Installer may not work correctly in the
current version of SMS Installer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Declare all DLL calls as CALLBACK functions in the DLL code, as in the following
sample:

   BOOL CALLBACK MyFunction(lpDllParams DLL32CALLPARAMS);
