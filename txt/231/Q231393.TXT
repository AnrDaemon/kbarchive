TITLE   :BUG: Using DCOM with an Active Document
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbcode kbActiveDocs kbDCOM kbDownload kbVBp600bug kbCodeDownload kbGrpDSInet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Navigating to an Active Document that uses Distributed Component Object Model
(DCOM) results in the following message:

   Internet Explorer is opening file of unknown type: <Name of
   Document>.VBD from...

This happens when CliReg32.exe is included in the CAB instead of downloaded from
the Microsoft Web site, or installed as a separate CAB from the local server.

CAUSE
=====

When packaging up a DCOM Active Document using the Visual Basic Package and
Deployment Wizard (PDW), the user gets the option to include CliReg32.exe in the
current CAB; however, selecting this option does not work properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Choose to download CliReg32.exe from the Microsoft Web site, or download
Msracli.cab from the Microsoft site and refer to in from your local Web server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you look in the code download error log file, you should see the following
error:

   Code Download Error: (hr = 80070057) The parameter is incorrect.

Use the following steps to view this file:

1. From the Internet Explorer 4 View menu, select Internet Options. Or from the
   Internet Explorer 5 Tools menu, select Internet Options.

2. On the General tab, click Settings.

3. Click the View Files button.

4. Sort the files by clicking on the Name column header.

5. You should see at least one file named something like this:

   ?CodeDownloadErrorLog!name={0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}

   Where the zeroes contain the class ID of your Active Document.

6. Close the dialog boxes that you opened in steps 2 and 3.

7. Drag the error log into Internet Explorer.

NOTE: CliReg32.exe could be packaged in its own CAB, but not in the same one as
the .vbr or .tlb files. Note that the PDW assumes the .inf file name is
Msracli.inf when you choose a local CAB. To avoid changing each .inf file
generated for any DCOM project, name the .inf in your CLIREG CAB Msracli.inf.
