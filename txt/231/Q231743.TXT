 - Microsoft Word for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word 97, when you print a document with a table of contents, or
with several lines containing dot leaders with right-aligned tabs, the dot
leaders may not line up correctly, or the dot leaders may print over text in the
document.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because of an issue with the printer driver.

This behavior can occur if all of the following conditions are true:

 - The dot leader lines are formatted in 11 point Arial font.

 - You are using a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Workstation-based computer.

 - Microsoft Windows NT Service Pack 3 is installed on the computer.

 - The document is printed to a Hewlett Packard (HP) LaserJet 4si or 5si
   printer.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4, or contact
Hewlett Packard to obtain an appropriate printer driver for the LaserJet 4si or
5si printer.
