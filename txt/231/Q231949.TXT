SYMPTOMS
========

When you start your computer, Windows NT 4.0 does a CPUID check for an Intel
processor. If the processor is a Pentium II or Pentium III, code paths are
opened to allow write-combining. The AMD Athlon processor also has the
write-combining functionality, but the feature is not enabled when the kernel is
initialized.

write-combining functionality for the AMD Athlon processor.
