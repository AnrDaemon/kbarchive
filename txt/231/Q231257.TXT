TITLE   :SMS: Software Metering Does Not Reserve License When Checked Out
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbClient kbSecurity kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbAudit kbsmsMeter

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a computer checks out a license, and then restarts when it is connected to
the network, the license is released upon startup. The workstation can continue
to use the checked-out license, and the server can also allocate that license to
other computers. The server retains the record of the checked-out license but
does not indicate that the license is "in use" for that client.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, release the checked-out license (close the
appropriate program) before you restart the computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version for Microsoft Systems
Management Server version 2.0.
