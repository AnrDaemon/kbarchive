TITLE   :SMS: Remote Tools Command Line Tool Fails with Valid IPX No.
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You use the Remote.exe command line tool to try to start a remote control
session with an IPX client, and you receive the following error message:

   Security rights to run Remote Tools on this client have been denied.

CAUSE
=====

You have omitted the extraneous zeroes that appear as the first part of the
client?s IPX network address.




WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you must supply all of the leading zeroes for the
client's IPX network address. You should take note of the network address, which
will be similar to "00000000:0050BAD49253."

Type the following command but replace the network address with that of your
client computer.

   "remote.exe 1 00000000:0050BAD49253" (without the quotation marks)


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 2.0.
