The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0

SUMMARY
=======

In the Visual C++ Integrated Development Environment (IDE) you can open a file
belonging to a Project via the Open item on the File menu or from the FileView
tab in the Workspace window. You can open files that don't belong to the current
project using the File menu's Open item only. The window displaying the file
contents opens up docked or with certain dimensions that cannot be specified by
anyone.

This article explains how to control the dimensions of the window that is
launched when an existing file is opened in the Visual C++ editor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The dimensions of the windows containing the file data can be controlled using
Visual C++ Automation. The Visual Basic Scripting Edition code below captures
the DocumentOpen event and then specifies the Window dimensions:

   sub Application_DocumentOpen(theDocument)
     theDocument.ActiveWindow.Height = 500
     theDocument.ActiveWindow.Width = 500
   end sub

Use the following steps to use the above macro in Visual C++:

1. Open an existing file with the .dsm extension or create one.

2. Paste the above code in the file.

3. In Visual C++ do the following:
   a. From the Tools menu, select Customize.

   b. Select the Add-ins and Macros Files tab

   c. Click the Browse button to load the DSM file containing the above Macro.
      Once the file has been selected in the Browse dialog box, your DSM file
      will appear in the Add-ins and macro file list with a checked box next to
      it.

   d. Click Close to continue.

If you modify the macro, you should reload it by right-clicking within the Visual
C++ editor window that has the corresponding .dsm file open and selecting the
Reload Macro File item from the shortcut menu.

This macro works for the text-based files only, For example, it has no effect in
the Resource Editor. You can also implement this as an Add-In written in Visual
C++ or Visual Basic. It handles only opening existing files. To handle creation
of new documents, you should use the NewDocument event.
