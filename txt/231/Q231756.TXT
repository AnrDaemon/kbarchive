TITLE   :The Convert.exe Tool Uses 512-Byte Clusters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Convert.exe tool to convert a partition from a FAT file system
to an NTFS file system, the NTFS partition uses 512-byte clusters.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Convert.exe tool uses the default cluster size of 512 bytes. Using a smaller
cluster size allows more efficient use of space on the hard disk and greater
probability that the Convert.exe tool has sufficient disk space to perform the
conversion.

To change the cluster size, use the /a switch with the Format utility to specify
the desired cluster size. For information about default cluster sizes, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q140365 Default Cluster Size for FAT and NTFS

Additional query words: utility sector fat32 convert.exe
