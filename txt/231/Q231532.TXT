KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork kbsetup kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MapPoint 2000 
 - Microsoft MapPoint 2001 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install Microsoft MapPoint on a Novell NetWare server, you
may receive the following error message:

   The specified volume does not support long file names. To force short file
   names, exit now and restart Setup using the /F command line.

If you attempt to install MapPoint using the /F command line, you receive the
same error message.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if long filename support is disabled on the Novell
NetWare volume.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, enable long filename support on the Novell NetWare
volume. To do this, install the appropriate namespace for your version of Novell
NetWare (Long.nam or Os2.nam) on the Novell NetWare volume.

To enable long filename support on Novell NetWare 3.11, download and install the
311ptd.exe operating system patch from the following Novell Web site:

   http://support.novell.com

After you enable long filename support using the instructions included in this
patch, you must add the following lines to the System.ini file:

   [NWRedir]
   SupportLFN=2

MORE INFORMATION
================

NetWare volume, contact your system administrator, Novell, or a local authorized
