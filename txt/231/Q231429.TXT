TITLE   :XFOR: Can Send But Cannot Receive Inbound Internet Mail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Exchange Server Internet Mail Service, you can send Internet
mail but you cannot receive it.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) Service from
the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack has been installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, open Control Panel, double-click Services, and then
disable the SMTP Service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SMTP Service is an optional service which can be installed when you install
Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0. Do not install the SMTP Service
when you install IIS on an Exchange Server computer. IIS is required by Outlook
Web Access (OWA); during IIS installation, the SMTP Service may be installed by
mistake.

The Internet Mail Service needs exclusive use of TCP port 25 to successfully
transport SMTP mail. If another program reserves port 25, the Internet Mail
Service may start successfully, but incoming mail may not be accepted. For
