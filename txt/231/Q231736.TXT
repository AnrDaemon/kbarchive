PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kberrmsg

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running AutoCAD R14 by Autodesk and you are opening a file from a
third-party Server Message Block (SMB) server, you may receive the following
prompt in AutoCAD even though the file is not open on another client:

   Do you wish to open for read-only?

This problem can occur on third-party file servers that use the SMB redirector
network interface. (Third-party UNIX connectivity software that uses SMB
services includes Samba, Syntax, and Digital Pathworks.)

CAUSE
=====

Autodesk has identified an operating system timing conflict that some
third-party file servers interpret as a file-sharing violation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Autodesk has developed a patch for AutoCAD release 14.01 to resolve this problem
by changing which calls AutoCAD makes during save operations. The patch is
available from the following Autodesk Technical Assistance Web site:
