-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Starting the Open file dialog box in VC++ through the keyboard shortcut key or
from the File menu will result in the following error:

   Access Violation (0xC0000005) in DEVSHL.DLL at 0x5003eaed.
   DevShl.Dll referenced memory at 0x0000000. The memory could not be read.

The same error occurs when you select Add to Project from the Files submenu from
the Project menu.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when there are too many ActiveX document servers registered
on the computer.


RESOLUTION
==========

Unregister any known ActiveX document servers that are not needed on the system.
In most cases, running the server executable with a /UNREGISTER switch will
unregister the server.

Another solution is to use a Developer Studio Add-in to place the open and
add-to-project features in Visual C++ For more information, see the following
Knowledge Base article:

   Q241396 FileTool.exe replaces the open and add-to-project features in VC++
