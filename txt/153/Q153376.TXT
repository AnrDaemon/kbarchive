TITLE   :Redial on Link Failure Problems After Upgrade
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you upgrade Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 to Windows NT 4.0, the Redial On Link
Failure option may not work properly.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior was observed in builds through 1345.03 (RC1) and may occur in
subsequent builds of Microsoft Windows NT 4.0. After the upgrade from 3.51, the
new TAPI API set is not used for modems already defined in Remote Access Service
(RAS).

Instead, the older style components are left in place and the Modem.inf file is
used instead of UNIMODEM. Without using UNIMODEM, the TAPI API set may not
monitor the status of the connection properly. RAS may attempt to redial if a
connection attempt fails, but may not redial on failure of an established
connection.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.
   Double-click the Network icon.

2. Click the Services tab and select Remote Access Service.

3. Click Remove, and then click OK.

4. Restart the computer.

5. Rename the System32\Ras directory to System32\Ras.old.

6. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.
   Double-click the Network icon.

7. Click the Services tab, and then click Add.

8. Select Remote Access Service to re-install RAS, and then click OK.

9. Restart the computer.

10. Copy the phonebook files from System32\Ras.old to the System32\Ras
   directory.

11. Make any other necessary configuration changes to RAS as required.
