The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Visual Basic 4.0's Data Control does not send notifications to its clients when
the RecordSource property is changed. Close the form containing the Datacontrol;
then open it again. Or run the program, and go back into the IDE. The correct
list of fields will now show up in the Listfield property of the DBList control.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Add a Data control and a DBList control to a new form in a new project in
   Visual Basic 4.0.

2. Set the Database name property of the DataControl to biblio.mdb and the
   RecordSource property of the Data control to the Authors table.

3. Set the Datasource property of the DBList to Data1 and the ListField property
   to author.

4. Change the Recordsource property of DataControl to the Titles table.

5. Go back to the DBList control, and click the pick list button of the
   Listfield property. You will not see the new fields for the new table.

NOTE: The Remote DataControl works correctly in this respect.
