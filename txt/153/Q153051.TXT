TITLE   :Jetpack.exe May Complete and Not Compress DHCP or WINS Database
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When Jetpack.exe (Jetpack) is used to compact Wins.mdb or Dhcp.mdb, it may
complete without an error and still be using the original Wins.mdb or Dhcp.mdb.
This happens when Jetpack is run and a temporary file is specified on a
partition other than the one where the original .mdb file is located. Jetpack
will display a message that it is moving the temp file to the original location
and then respond that Jetpack completed successfully.

CAUSE
=====

After Jetpack writes the new .mdb files to the location specified on the command
line, it removes the original and moves the Temp.mdb while renaming it Wins.mdb
or Dhcp.mdb. Jetpack can only move files that are located on the same partition.
When Jetpack moves a file to a different partition, it actually copies the file
then renames it if necessary. When Jetpack can not move the file successfully it
does not report an error and gives a message that Jetpack was successful.

RESOLUTION
==========

It may be necessary to run Jetpack with the temp file located on a different
partition than the original WINS or DHCP database due to disk resources. If this
is necessary, copy the temp file back to the Wins or Dhcp directory and rename
it to Wins.mdb or Dhcp.mdb prior to restarting the WINS or DHCP service.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT version 4.0.
