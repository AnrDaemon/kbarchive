The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 95, 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade to Microsoft Windows 95 from Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11, and you upgrade to Schedule+ version 7.0 from Schedule+ version
1.0, you may get the following error message:

   Your local shared Schedule+ was previously synchronized with another version.

NOTE: You will not be able to access your existing Schedule+ appointments.

CAUSE
=====

The Schedule+ version 1.0 .CAL file that the Setup program is trying to migrate
may be corrupt.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

1. Export the appointments out in Schedule+ Interchange format.

2. Run Schedule+ by pressing the CTRL and SHIFT keys while you double-click the
   icon.

   The following dialog box will appear:

   You have launched Schedule+ with the CTRL and SHIFT keys held down. If you
   continue, Schedule+ will clear your schedule data. A backup copy of the data
   will be saved in your Windows directory.

   Are you sure you want to clear your schedule data?

3. Answer Yes.

4. Import the file previously exported in step 1.
