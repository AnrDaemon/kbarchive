TITLE   :Pager Notification Not Supported with Some Voice Modems
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95 msphone1

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Phone, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you enable the Pager Notification feature in Microsoft Phone, you may not
receive pager notification from Microsoft Phone when you receive new messages.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur for either of the following reasons:

 - The Pager Notification feature is not properly enabled or configured.

 - Your voice modem does not support the generation of DTMF codes during a voice
   call.

   NOTE: Microsoft Phone provides no indication of whether or not your modem
   supports the generation of DTMF codes during a voice call.

RESOLUTION
==========

To verify that you have properly enabled and configured the Pager Notification
feature, follow these steps:

1. Start Microsoft Phone.

2. On the Options menu, point to Mailbox Settings, and then click the
   appropriate mailbox.

3. Click the Notification tab, and then click the "Notify me when new messages
   arrive" check box to select it.

4. In the Number box, type the phone number for your pager.

5. Click the Pager check box to select it.

6. In the Pager Message box, type a message to be sent to your pager when you
   receive new messages.

7. Configure the When To Notify Me settings the way you want them.

8. Click OK.

If you still do not receive pager notification when new messages arrive, contact
your voice modem's manufacturer to determine whether the voice modem supports
the generation of DTMF codes during a voice call. Without this support,
Microsoft Phone 1.0 is unable to perform pager notification.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following voice modems are known not to support the generation of DTMF codes
during a voice call:

 - Voice modems based on the Cirrus chip set

 - Voice modems included with Compaq Presario model CDS 520, 720, and 920 series
   computers
