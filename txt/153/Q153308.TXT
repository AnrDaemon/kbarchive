SUMMARY
=======

The TAB key is often used to navigate sequentially through multiple controls on
a form. The order in which you move through the controls depends on their
TabIndex value, not their position on the form. This article provides you with a
simple method you can use to set up a required tab sequence.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, the TabIndex property is set when you place a control on a form
relative to the other controls on the form. To set up a required tab sequence,
in the design environment, select the control you wish to be last in the tab
sequence. Set its TabIndex to Zero. Select each control in the opposite
direction from that which the user will use to navigate through the form, and
set each control's TabIndex to Zero.

Each time you set the TabIndex for a control, all the other controls have their
TabIndex recalculated so as you set them to Zero all the other controls are
incremented by one.
