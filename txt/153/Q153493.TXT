SUMMARY
=======

This article demonstrates how to return files to a particular version without
losing the individual file history. If you use the Rollback feature of
SourceSafe or Visual SourceSafe, you lose the history of the file.

================

Step-by-Step Procedures
-----------------------

1. Perform a Get on the version you want to roll back to in the working
   directory of the project.

2. Highlight the latest version of the file in the Visual SourceSafe Explorer,
   and hold the SHIFT key down while clicking CheckOut. Select the "Do not get
   local copy" option. This checks out the files but does not Get them to the
   working directory.

3. Check in the files that are checked out, and SourceSafe will bring in the
   older version. The history of the files will remain intact.
