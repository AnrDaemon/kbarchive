TITLE   :Shared Applications and Drive Mapping Problems
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPGC smspgc

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The following problems may occur with shared applications and drive mappings:

 - When you use MSOFFICE as a shared application, more than one drive may be
   mapped to the MSAPPS and OFFICE shares.

 - Shared applications do not use existing connections to the appropriate
   shares. Drives mapped prior to going into Windows are not used and new drives
   are mapped for each application launched.

 - Not all of the connections are deleted after closing a shared application.
   Some are deleted within three minutes but others remain indefinitely.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
