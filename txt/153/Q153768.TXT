======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

By default, unattended setup installs Windows NT to drive C (the first partition
on the first drive in the system). In some cases, you may want to separate the
Windows NT boot partition (the partition where the operating system files are
located) from the system partition (the partition where Boot.ini, Ntdetect.com,
and NTLDR reside).

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use a Winnt.exe feature to separate the boot partition from system
partition. This feature is unrelated to unattended setup. The /T: option is used
to specify the location where the $Win_nt$.~ls directory will be placed during
setup when Winnt.exe is used. The /T: option defaults to drive C.

Example:

On a single drive divided into two partitions, both partitions are formatted FAT
to create a drive C and a drive D. The source for I386 is on a server and has a
mapped driver letter of X:

x:\winnt /b /t:d: /s:x:\ /u:x:\unattend.txt

After the first reboot, if you stop the installation and go to MS-DOS, you will
see that the $Win_nt$.~bt directory is on drive C and the $Win_nt$.~ls is on
drive D. During the GUI portion of setup, you will notice that files are copied
to their appropriate directories on drive D not drive C.
