The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When NTBACKUP attempts to read the catalog file of a tape backup volume, one of
the following error messages is displayed:

   Catalog Information: Unable to load catalog data from tape.

-or-

   Catalog Error: Error writing a catalog file, check available space.

CAUSE
=====

This error may be caused by insufficient available space on the target drive for
catalog file expansion, occurring when the target drive has approximately 99
percent or more of its space allocated.

RESOLUTION
==========

Currently, there are only two workarounds for this problem:

 - Delete files on the target drive to create more available space

   -or-

 - Replace the target drive with a larger-capacity hard disk drive
