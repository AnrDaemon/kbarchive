SUMMARY
=======

This article shows by example how you can determine at any given point if the
text entered into a text box can be undone.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can send an EM_CANUNDO message to a TextBox control to determine whether an
operation on it can be undone; that is, whether the control can respond to the
EM_UNDO message. If the TextBox control can correctly process the EM_UNDO
message, the return value from SendMessage() is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic 4.0. Form1 is added by default.

2. Add a text box (Text1) to Form1.

3. Add the following code to the General Declaration portion of Form1:

      Const EM_CANUNDO = &HC6
      Private Declare Function SendMessage Lib "user32" Alias _
                "SendMessageA" _      (ByVal hwnd As Long, ByVal wMsg As Long,
      ByVal wParam As Long, ByVal _    lParam As Long) As Long

      Private Sub Form_Click()
        Dim lRet As Long

        lRet = SendMessage(Text1.hwnd, EM_CANUNDO, 0&, 0&)
        Debug.Print lRet
      End Sub

4. Press F5 to run the program. Type some text into the text box and click
   Form1. The Debug window will display a value of 1 indicating that the text
   just entered can be undone. Note that if no text is typed into the text box
   and the form is clicked, SendMessage() will return 0, as there is nothing to
   undo.
