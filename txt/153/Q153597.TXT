TITLE   :XADM: Japanese Version Cannot use "Service" as Service Account
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0, Japanese version 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Exchange Japanese version 4.0, running on the Japanese version of
Microsoft Windows NT 3.51, if the Windows NT Primary Domain Controller (PDC) is
Japanese and the Microsoft Exchange Service Account is specified as "service",
Microsoft Exchange will use "NT AUTHORITY\SERVICE" as the Microsoft Exchange
Service Account, rather than "service".

WORKAROUND
==========

You can use any name other than "service" as the Microsoft Exchange Service
Account.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Japanese
version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.



Additional query words: Service, Japanese, DBCS
