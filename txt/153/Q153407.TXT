TITLE   :SMS: Inventory Does Not Collect Windows NT Service Pack Versions
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


On a Windows NT client computer, the Service Pack version information is not
collected by Systems Management Server inventory.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The CurrentVersion value is collected during inventory in the following
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree:

   \SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT

Therefore, Windows NT 3.51 is displayed. However, the CSDVersion value is not
collected during inventory.

The ability to see which service packs have been installed is important for
managing computers in a network enterprise. Some software only runs on specific
Service Pack versions, and an administrator needs to be able to determine which
computer has been upgraded and which one still requires upgrades to a specific
Service Pack. This feature allows us to see whether the update to a new service
pack has been successful. Windows NT resets the value CSDVersion at every boot
time to match the kernel that is loaded. Therefore, if an update job fails, the
computer still displays the previous service pack version that was inventoried.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
