The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The WINS Server Service fails to start and the following error message appears
in the system event log:

   Event ID 4179

   WINS Could not create the notification socket. Make sure the TCP/IP driver is
   installed and running properly.

CAUSE
=====

During the WINS Server service initialization, the service checks for the port
number that the Name service will bind to. The service does this by calling the
GetServByName API. This API must locate the Services file under System32\Drivers
directory. If the Services file is missing, the GetServByName API will fail. The
result is that the WINS Service will raise an exception indicating that the
service could not create the notification socket. This exception will be logged
in the error log as Event ID 4179.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure that the Services file is in the System32\Drivers directory. The
Services file provides service-name-to-port-ID resolution for Windows Sockets
applications.
