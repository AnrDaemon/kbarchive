TITLE   :Sms.ini Not Updating Server/Share Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup smssetupkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


During a site or domain change, Invwin32.exe leaves old server names and share
names in the Sms.ini. This will cause problems for other client components (such
as PCM and PGC.) The other client components attempt to use one of the old
server names, assuming they are logon servers for the new site/domain.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
