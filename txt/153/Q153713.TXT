The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, versions 3.11, 3.11a, 3.11b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

By default, a client computer running Windows for Workgroups using the Microsoft
TCP/IP-32 protocol refreshes its name with the Windows Internet Name Service
(WINS) server every 16 minutes.

This behavior is different from the behavior of client computers running WINS on
Windows NT Workstation, which refresh initially at one-eighth and subsequently
at one-half of the WINS Renewal Interval (as defined on the WINS server).

MORE INFORMATION
================

To change the interval at which a client computer running Windows for Workgroups
TCP/IP-32 refreshes its WINS registration, perform the following steps:

1. Open the System.ini file in a text editor such as Notepad.

2. In the [NBT] section of the System.ini file, add the following entry:

   " InitialRefreshT.O.="X" " (without the quotation marks)

   Where "X" is the WINS refresh interval in milliseconds. The minimum (and
   default) setting is InitialRefreshT.O.=960000 (16*60*100=960000, or 16
   minutes) and the maximum is 4294967295, or about 50 days.

The default refresh interval of 16 minutes may cause unwanted network traffic on
networks using dial-up routers.

For additional TCP/IP settings, see the TCP/IP-32 Help file, Mtcpip32.hlp.
