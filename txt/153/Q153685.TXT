TITLE   :FP: FrontPage Appears to Hang When Using Dial-Up-Adapter
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER::; WINDOWS:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for Windows 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q194237.

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use a Dial-Up-Adapter to connect to the Internet and you are not
currently connected, your computer may appear to hang (stop responding) when you
use FrontPage Explorer or FrontPage TCP/IP Test.

CAUSE
=====

If you are using DNS for name resolution, any call to the TCP/IP stack attempts
to resolve to an IP address. If you are not connected to your Internet service
provider, the DNS server available is not available. The computer attempts to
wait until a DNS server replies.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, follow these steps:

1. Find the Hosts file (located in the C:\Windows\ folder). If it does not
   exist, rename Hosts.sam to Hosts.

2. Open the Hosts file in a text editor (such as Notepad), and add the following
   line to the end of the file

   "127.0.0.1 <fqdn>" (without the quotation marks)

   where <fqdn> is the Fully Qualified Domain Name as specified on the DNS
   Configuration tab of the TCP/IP Properties tab (double-click the Network icon
   in Windows Control Panel). For example, if the Host is named Example and the
   Domain is called Microsoft.com, add the following line to the Hosts file:

   "127.0.0.1 example.microsoft.com" (without the quotation marks)
