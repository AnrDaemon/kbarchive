TITLE   :Saving Key in RegEdt32 May Cause Access Denied Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to save a Registry key within Registry Editor you receive the
following error message:

   Access Denied: Insufficient Privilege To Save Key.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs by design when the top level of a Registry hive is selected
for a Save Key operation. This occurs even if you are logged on as the
Administrator with Full Control permissions on the top level of each Registry
key.

This error also occurs because these hives, HKEY_USERS and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE,
consist of other hives, namely HKEY_CURRENT_USER or HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT.

NOTE: This error does not occur when HKEY_CURRENT_USER and HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT is
selected and Save Key is selected.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can successfully save subhives elsewhere in the tree, or save the complete
Registry. To save the complete Registry, you must either perform a complete tape
backup with the Backup Registry option selected, or use the Regback utility
included as part of the Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit.
