======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Phone, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Phone to dial a local number with the same area code as
the current location, a 1 may be dialed before the local phone number.

CAUSE
=====

If you click the Dial As Long Distance check box in the Dialing Options dialog
box to select it, whether you click Cancel or OK, the Dial As Long Distance
check box remains selected for that phone number and any other local phone
number with the same prefix. Once the check box is selected, the prefix of the
number being dialed is added to the list of toll prefixes associated with the
current location.

RESOLUTION
==========

To remove the local prefix from the list of toll prefixes, use either of the
following methods:

 - In Microsoft Phone, click Dialing Options, enter the local number or another
   local number with the same prefix, click the Dial As Long Distance check box
   to clear it, and then click OK.

 - Remove the prefix from the list of toll prefixes manually. To do so, follow
   these steps:

   1. In Microsoft Phone, click Connect Using on the Tools menu.

   2. Click Fax Properties, click the Dialing tab, and then click Toll Prefixes.

   3. Click the prefix, click Remove, and then click OK.

      NOTE: These settings are global settings that affect fax calls as well as
      calls placed with Microsoft Phone.
