KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbVBp400bug kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A dual-boot system with Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT has the Enterprise
Edition installed while the system is running Windows NT. The system is rebooted
under Windows for Workgroups and the Enterprise Edition is installed in the same
Visual Basic directory using the Reinstall option. Upon starting Visual Basic
under Windows for Workgroups, the Startup windows indicate that the Standard
edition is starting. The Standard Edition of Visual Basic is 32-bit only.

CAUSE
=====

The Reinstall option of the Setup program does not reregister files if the files
are on the system.

RESOLUTION
==========

Rename or delete the file vb4stp16.stf and reinstall the Enterprise Edition
under both operating systems. This file is located in the default Visual Basic
directory. Deleting or renaming this file will cause the files to be correctly
registered during the reinstallation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. Microsoft is researching this issue and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

   Visual Basic.

2. Reboot the computer under Windows for Workgroups and install the Enterprise
   Edition using the Reinstall option of the Setup program in the same Visual
   Basic directory.

3. Start Visual Basic under Windows for Workgroups. Note that the Startup screen
