TITLE   :Double Quotes in Software Inventory Package Causes Event ID 118
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When you create a software inventory package and specify "Microsoft Excel.exe"
(including the double quotation marks) as a filename, the following error
message appears in the Systems Management Server Administrator User Interface:

   Couldn't create a new package.

In addition, the following event is logged in the Application Event log:

   Event ID: 118
   Non-fatal Error in module: SMS_MAINTENANCE_MANAGER
   Operation:   Parse
   Object:      File
   Object name: Package Rule File
   Error code:  1

   Cannot compile the package rule file
   <drive>:\SMS\site.srv\maincfg.box\pkgrule\package.rul for site UUU.
   MachineName = GREEBO
   SiteCode = UUU
   Component = SMS_MAINTENANCE_MANAGER

NOTE: The package does not appear in the Administrator User Interface. The
package information is written to the Package.rul file in the
\sms\site.srv\maincfg.box\pkgrule subdirectory.

CAUSE
=====

Maintenance Manager cannot compile the PACKAGE.RUL with packages that contain
filenames in double quotation marks. Therefore, when Maintenance Manager
compiles, the PKG_16.CFG files it creates are 0 bytes in size and an event is
written to the Application Event Log.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Manually remove the problem package(s) from the Package.rul file.

2. Do not use double quotation marks (") in a package filename.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
