TITLE   :WINS Server's Version IDs Might not Update
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Version ID's for Workstation and Messenger service entries in WINS might not get
updated.

CAUSE
=====

When a WINS Server is started, it is possible that the Workstation and Messenger
services will start before the WINS Server Service starts. Therefore, the
initial registration will not occur and the Version ID for these entries will
not be updated. Refreshes will continue, which will be evident by a change in
the expiration date.

Under normal conditions, an entry will not disappear from the database and when
the Verify Interval occurs, the entry will be verified and then properly
updated. In a Replication scenario, if the WINS Servers entries are lost from
the partners database, these entries will not replicate.

RESOLUTION
==========

Manually stop and restart the Workstation and Messenger Service on the WINS
Server to have the names re-register. They should then have updated Version ID's
and replicate during the defined time interval.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.


Additional query words: 3.5 3.51 4.0
