TITLE   :Some IPC$ Connections Cannot Be Disconnected
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to a Microsoft Windows NT version 3.51 server share, an initial
connection is made to IPC$ and the connection is assigned to the username in
Server Manager. This connection should drop off after the username has been
authenticated, but it does not. However, it can be disconnected manually in
Server Manager as long as the connection is still associated with the username.

Once you disconnect from the resource, the IPC$ connection is enabled until
Autodisconnect disconnects it. At the point that you disconnect from the
resource, the IPC$ connection is associated with your computer name. The IPC$
connection cannot be broken in Server Manager. Autodisconnect will break it
unless it has been made unavailable.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Enable Autodisconnect and set for a time appropriate for your environment.
   This can be done via the command line:

   NET CONFIG SERVER /AUTODISCONNECT:<minutes>

   NOTE: The Windows NT Server service is self-tuning, normally the server
   configuration parameters are auto-configured (calculated and set) each time
   you boot Windows NT. If you run NET CONFIG SERVER in conjunction with the
   /AUTODISCONNECT, /SERVCOMMENT or /HIDDEN switches, the current values for the
   automatically tuned parameters are displayed and written to the registry.
   Once these parameters are written to the registry, you cannot tune the Server
   service using Control Panel Networks. If you changed any of the Server
   service settings, Windows NT is no longer able to automatically tune the
   Server service for your new configuration. To avoid losing the Server
   service's auto self-tuning capability, make the change through registry
   editor instead from a command line or Control Panel Network.

   base:

   Q138365 How the Autodisconnect Works in Windows NT

2. Make an explicit connection to the IPC$ share and then disconnect from it.

   NET USE \\servername\ipc$
   NET USE \\servername\ipc$ /d

   -or-

3. Upgrade to Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0, where this problem has been
   corrected.
