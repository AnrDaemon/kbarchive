TITLE   :XCON: Dynamic RAS Connector Ignores Defined Prefix and Suffix
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Microsoft Exchange Dynamic RAS Connector dials to create a connection,
it will ignore any prefix or suffix defined in the Phone Number Settings entry
in the NT RAS phone book. This causes the dial attempt to fail if the prefix or
the suffix is required for the connection.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, enter the required prefix or suffix on the Phone Number
line in the phone book entry.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: RAS prefix suffix pbx pots
