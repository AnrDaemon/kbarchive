TITLE   :AcmeWkSt.exe Does Not Use Existing Installed Directory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPCM smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When using Package Command Manager (PCM) to install an application like
Microsoft Office 4.2c, ACMEWKST will not detect previous installations of the
application(s). This makes it very difficult to upgrade existing applications.
Currently, ACMEWKST will install the application to the drive with the most free
space. If the drive with the most free space is not the same drive where the
application to be upgraded is installed, you end up with two installations of
the application, one on each drive.

CAUSE
=====


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. A fix to this problem is in development, but has not been fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this
fix. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information on the
availability of this fix.
