TITLE   :PRB: Exclamation Mark in Folder Name Causes Genmenu Error

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you generate a menu in a folder when name of that folder contains an
exclamation point (!), the following error appears:

   File '<hard drive name>:<folder name>:<file name>.DBC' does
   not exist. Line number 649

Here 'hard drive name' is the name of the Macintosh hard drive, 'folder name' is
the name of the folder up to the exclamation point, and 'file name' is the text
after the exclamation point. After you click the OK button, another error
appears:

   Menu <file name> is invalid
   Line number 657

Here 'file name' is the name of the menu file that Genmenu.prg attempted to
create.

The same errors occur in Visual FoxPro for Windows; however, the line numbers and
the path structures differ. Remove the exclamation point from the folder name.

CAUSE
=====

The Genmenu program has difficulty parsing a path that contains a folder name
that contains an exclamation point. The program is treating the exclamation
point as a separator between a database and a table name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
