TITLE   :Install Not Found Installing IIS on MSDN Level III CD
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Internet Information Server (IIS) from the MSDN Level III
Backoffice compact disc 2 Setup program, you are prompted to enter Internet
compact disc 4. The Setup program then displays the following message:

   Backoffice 2.0 Installer cannot find the required files in the specified
   path. In particular, the following file was not found:
   f:\insertsrv\i386\install.exe.

CAUSE
=====

The file Install.exe was not included on the Internet Server compact disc.

RESOLUTION
==========

A replacement for Install.exe is posted on Microsoft's FTP server. These files
are self-extracting.

For each platform the URLs are:

   Alpha
   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com:/developr/msdn/newup/IIS_ALPH.EXE

   i386
   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com:/developr/msdn/newup/IIS_I386.EXE

   MIPS
   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com:/developr/msdn/newup/IIS_MIPS.EXE

   Power PC
   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com:/developr/msdn/newup/IIS_PPC.EXE

If you run the Setup program on an I386 platform:

1. Copy the i386 directory tree to a temporary directory on your hard drive:

   xcopy /s d:\inetsrv\i386 c:\temp\i386
   xcopy /s d:\inetsrv\docs c:\temp\docs
   xcopy /s d:\inetsrv\help c:\temp\help

2. Uncompress Install.exe file from the appropriate self extracting file and
   place it in the C:\Temp\i386 directory.

3. Copy the inetsrv file from the \Inetsrv directory compact disc to c:\temp
   (one directory level up from where Install.exe was copied).

   copy d:\inetsrv\inetsrv. c:\temp

4. Run Install.exe from C:\Temp\i386.

If you are installing Internet Server on a RISC platform computer, substitute the
appropriate directory names for your platform.
