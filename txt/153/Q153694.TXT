TITLE   :FIX: SQLNumResultCols Fails with Incorrect Syntax Near 'SET'
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.65
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 2.65 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Calling SQLNumResultCols after SQLPrepare of a SELECT statement that contains a
subquery in the select list will fail with:

   szSqlState = "37000", pfNativeError = 156
   szErrorMsg="[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]
   Incorrect syntax near the keyword 'SET'."

CAUSE
=====

When the SQL Server ODBC driver constructs the T-SQL statement that will be sent
to the server to resolve the number of columns that will be returned in the
resultset, it incorrectly parses the initial query and excludes the final table
name. For example:

      SQLPrepare(hstmt, "SELECT t1.c1, (SELECT t2.c1 FROM t2)
                         FROM t1", 44)
      SQLNumResultCols(hstmt, pcol1)

This results in the following statement being sent to the server on the call to
SQLNumResultCols:

      SET FMTONLY ON SELECT t1.c1, (SELECT t2.c1 FROM t2)
      FROM SET FMTONLY OFF

Hence, causing SQL Server to report "Incorrect syntax near the Keyword 'SET'."

WORKAROUND
==========

Where possible convert the offending query to a SQL Server VIEW.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SQL Server ODBC Driver
version 2.65.0201. This problem was corrected in U.S. Service Pack 1 for
Microsoft SQL Server version 6.5. For more information, contact your primary
support provider.
