TITLE   :BUG: MSDEV May Leave Orphaned Threads in the Memory After Exit
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:4.00 4.10 4.20
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbide kbVC kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Visual C++ Developer Studio may leave orphaned threads in memory after
exit.

The Developer Studio disappears from the taskbar on Windows 95 or the task list
on Windows NT, but the process sticks around with two threads, and it is visible
from PView. Notice that the Developer Studio Debugger can attach to this process
in a subsequent debug session.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Developer Studio is orphaned in memory only when switching the books in the
"Select Reference" dialog box after using the F1 key. To work around the
problem, change the book selection from the Help menu by choosing Open
Information Title before using the F1 key for online help.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start the Visual C++ Developer Studio.

2. Highlight a keyword in either a source file, a header file, or a help topic
   file that has entries in different information titles. For example, the word
   "printf" or "UNICODE" is in both the Visual C++ Books Online and the
   Microsoft Developer Library.

3. Press F1 to bring up the "Select Reference" dialog.

4. Switch to the other book in the combo box named "Titles which have index
   entries for :" and Display the topic.

5. Exit the Developer Studio.
