TITLE   :Sender Disconnect Results in Sharing Violations
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:smssenders kbSMSSenderkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the sender encounters either a redirector error or a network error, it
terminates abruptly and may not close the file it was writing to. This causes
the Windows NT Redirector to give an Error 32 (Sharing Violation).

CAUSE
=====

When a sender encounters a failure to write a buffer to a remote site, and when
it terminates due to this error, a single attempt is made to CloseHandle() on
the file handle it was writing to. If this handle close fails, entries remain in
the session tables of the Windows NT redirector. Minutes later, SMS dispatches a
new thread on a retry and the Windows NT redirector returns Error 32 (Sharing
Violation) because the session table still indicates that file name has a open
in another thread.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management
Server version 1.2.
