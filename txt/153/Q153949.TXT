TITLE   :CSNW Does Not Support MS-DOS Name Space Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a connection is made to a Novell NetWare Server, Client Services for
NetWare (CSNW) checks whether the volume supports OS/2 name space. If it does,
CSNW enables long file name support on that connection. However CSNW only
provides long file names for that connection . An application that needs MS-DOS
name space will fail.

CAUSE
=====

CSNW does not support MS-DOS name space if long file name support is enabled on
a connection.

RESOLUTION
==========


To correct this problem, first apply the updated Nwrdr.sys mentioned below and
then do the following:
