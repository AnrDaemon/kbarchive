The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Close Combat for Windows 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error when you start Close Combat:

   [ufs]Reference is invalid

CAUSE
=====

This error can be caused by the following situations.

Cause 1
-------

You receive the above error if the Campaign, Myob, or Replay folder is deleted
from the Close Combat\Games folder. To correct this problem, see the RESOLUTION
section below.

Cause 2
-------

This problem also occurs when you change the default location and do not specify
a directory (for example, if you enter d:\ instead of d:\cc\. If you change the
default location, make sure you specify a directory for the new location. To
correct this problem, see the "How to Re-install Close Combat" section below.

Cause 3
-------

This error may also occur if you install Close Combat to a drive other than
"C:\". When you select a different drive (for example, X), Setup defaults to
"X:\" and copies all the files to the root of the drive, causing the
"[ufs]Reference Is Invalid" error. To correct this problem, see the "Installing
to a Drive Other than C:\" section below.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem can be corrected by reinstalling Close Combat or creating the
missing folder(s).
