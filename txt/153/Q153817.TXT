SYMPTOMS
========

If a client has a removable media drive, such as ZIP Disk or Bernoulli, and
inventory is run against the client when there is no media in drive, inventory
fails with the following error messages:

   HARDWARE INVENTORY PHASE
   -[22%]-
   Not Ready Reading Drive D
   Abort, Retry, Fail?

NOTE: If you press A for Abort, you are instructed to select another default
drive and INVDOS halts. If you press F for Fail, INVDOS continues.

   SOFTWARE INVENTORY PHASE
   -[100%}-
   Not Ready Reading Drive D
   Abort, Retry, Fail?

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, create an SMSSAFE.TMP to skip the inventory check
for the drive. Insert the necessary media into the drive prior to inventory.
