TITLE   :XFOR: Apple Talk MTA not Transferring Mail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When messages are sent to the Apple Talk queue and are not delivered to the
%exchange_root%\connect\msmcon\maildata\macgate\store\pctomac directory, the
service account is not able to access the mailbag on the Microsoft Mail
Connector postoffice.

CAUSE
=====

The Apple Talk service will attempt to deliver a message from the Apple Talk
queue to the Microsoft Mail Connector postoffice. If the postoffice mailbag used
by the Apple Talk queue is corrupt, doesn't exist, or is inaccessible due to
permissions problems, messages will appear to be stuck in the queue.

RESOLUTION
==========

The mailbag on the Microsoft Mail Connector postoffice used by the Apple Talk
service needs to be recreated or rights need to be given to the service account
for the specified directory. The 00000002.mbg mailbag and 00000002.key keyfile
are used by the ATMTA to deliver mail from Microsoft Exchange to Apple Talk.
