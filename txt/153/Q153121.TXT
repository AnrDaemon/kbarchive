SUMMARY
=======

This article contains information about migrating users from a Microsoft Windows
for Workgroups postoffice (WGPO) to Microsoft Exchange Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Migrating users to Microsoft Exchange Server from a WGPO is the same as
migrating users from a Microsoft Mail 3.x postoffice. The basic architecture of
a WGPO and a Microsoft Mail postoffice is the same; therefore, using the
Microsoft Exchange Migration Wizard against a WGPO to migrate users to Microsoft
Exchange works the same way with Windows for Workgroups as it does with
Microsoft Mail.

Two things to be aware of when migrating from a WGPO:

 - When you use the Migration Wizard, an administrator account needs to be
   selected. With Microsoft Mail 3.x, the account named ADMINISTRATOR was the
   primary administrator account. With a WGPO, a user account with
   administration rights is the primary account. This user account is the
   account that is used as the administrator account by the Microsoft Exchange
   Migration Wizard.

 - With a WGPO, the default location for a user's mail message file(MMF) is the
   user's local hard disk drive. Migrate the user to Microsoft Exchange and then
   import the data from the local MMF to the Microsoft Exchange Server-based
   inbox or to their local Personal Information Store (PST) file.

For details on migrating Microsoft Mail users to Microsoft Exchange, see chapter
4 of the Microsoft Exchange Migration Guide. Also see the document on the
Microsoft Exchange Server compact disc about Migrating Microsoft Mail users to
Exchange. The document can be found with the following path:
