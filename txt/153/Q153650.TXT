OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbdocerr kbDatabase smsdatabase smsdocerr

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


Page 213, Chapter 6, under the "Removing Collected Files from a Site" section, of
the Systems Management Server 1.0 and 1.1 Administrator's guide states the
following:

   Using SMS Database Manager, you can remove both the record of the collected
   file in the site database and the collected file on the site server. For
   information about the SMS Database Manager, see the SMS Utilities Help file."

When you select "Delete Collected Files" in DBCLEAN, the files from the drive are
not physically removed. It only deletes the pointers to them from the Systems
Management Server database. In addition, a SMS Utilities Help file does not
exist.

WORKAROUND
==========

To remove the collected files, you must manually delete them from the site
server. The collected files are stored in the following subdirectory:

   SMS\site.srv\dataload.box\files.col\<site code>\<UID Code>\<SMS ID>

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
