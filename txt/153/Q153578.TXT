TITLE   :PGC Does Not Remove Some Icons from SMS Program Groups
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui kbPGC smspgc

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


In some situations, it is possible for Program Group Control (PGC) to create an
icon for a program group, then later not remove that icon when the program is
removed from the group through the SMS Administrator.

Another problem can arise when a user adds a non-SMS icon to an SMS program
group. PGC will not remove that icon the next time it updates the program group.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when both the NAD database and the registry no longer
contain a reference to the icon, yet the icon still exists in the program group.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SMS versions 1.0 and 1.1. A fix
to this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.
