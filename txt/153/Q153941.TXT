TITLE   :Install May Stop Responding on SCSI Drives Greater Than 8.4 GB
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT on a very large capacity SCSI drive (such as a
Seagate ST410-800N 10 GB SCSI drive), the system may stop responding during the
three-boot-floppy disk phase of the installation process, when Windows NT
attempts to load the SCSI device driver.

CAUSE
=====

The Translation For Drives Greater Than 2GB option may be enabled on a SCSI
controller with the large capacity SCSI drive attached.

The maximum drive size that can be translated by a SCSI controller BIOS is
computed as follows:

   255 heads x 63 sectors/track x 1024 cylinders x 512 bytes/sector =
   8,422,686,720 bytes or 8.4 GB

RESOLUTION
==========

Disable Translation For Drives Greater Than 2GB in the SCSI adapter BIOS before
you install Windows NT.
