SYMPTOMS
========

VPOWERD may cause a page fault (Fatal Exception error 0E) on the first reboot
during Windows 95 Setup on certain computer models that support advanced power
management (APM).


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

 - Disable the APM feature during Windows 95 Setup.

    - If you are not using an automated Setup, click the Custom button in the
      Setup Options screen, and then click the Advanced Power Management check
      box to clear it in the Computer Settings screen.

    - If you are using an automated Setup, add the following line to the
      [System] section of the Msbatch.inf file:

   "Power"="No APM" (include the quotation marks)

   This method disables all APM functionality in Windows 95.

 - You may be able to resolve this issue by upgrading the computer's BIOS.
   Contact the computer's manufacturer for information about a possible BIOS
   upgrade.
