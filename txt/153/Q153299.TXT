The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If SMS is installed within a subdirectory structure (for example, \Ntapps\Sms),
SMS will create this structure on each logon server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SMS takes the structure that it is installed in and re-creates it on each logon
server. Consequently SMS may not necessarily be installed in a structure
beginning with \SMS.

Additional query words: prodsms sms
