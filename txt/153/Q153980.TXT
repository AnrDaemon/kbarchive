TITLE   :Madge Smart Ringnode 16/4 Does Not Work on Shared Installation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:msnets win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a Madge Smart Ringnode 16/4 Token Ring network adapter with a
server-based installation of Windows 95, Windows 95 may not load the graphical
user interface (GUI). This does not affect stand-alone installations of Windows
95 installed from the server-based installation share; it affects only shared
installations.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 initially connects to the network server using NDIS 2 network
drivers. Windows 95 then unloads the NDIS 2 drivers and attempts to switch to an
NDIS 3.1 driver. The transition fails because the NDIS 3.1 driver does not
contain the Fast Mac Plus code, which sends commands to the network adapter to
reattach itself to the ring. The Fast Mac Plus Code is located in a file called
Mdgmport.bin, which is not included with the Windows 95 NDIS 3.1 driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain a new monolithic driver developed by Madge that contains both the NDIS
3.1 driver and the Fast Mac Plus code.

To obtain the updated driver, contact Madge Technical Support and request the new
monolithic Windows 95 driver for server-based installations of Windows 95.
