TITLE   :All Drives in My Computer Are Hidden
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Although you have turned off the Hide Drives In My Computer option in System
Policy Editor, all the drives in My Computer may still be hidden.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if you use System Policy Editor to create a system policy
with the Hide Drives In My Computer option enabled. This option cannot be
disabled in a system policy once it has been enabled because of a setting in the
default template (Admin.adm).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, modify the default template. To do so, follow these
steps:

1. Make a copy of the default system policy template file (Admin.adm). This file
   is located in the Windows\INF folder. Note that this folder may be hidden.

2. Use Notepad to open the Admin.adm file.

3. Search for the text "hidedrives" (without the quotation marks). The default
   entry for this section should be:

   POLICY !!HideDrives
   VALUENAME "NoDrives"
   VALUEON NUMERIC 67108863; low 26 bits on (1 bit per drive)

4. Modify this section to read as follows:

   POLICY !!HideDrives
   VALUENAME "NoDrives"
   VALUEON NUMERIC 67108863 ; low 26 bits on (1 bit per drive)
   VALUEOFF NUMERIC 0 ; ******

5. Save and then close the file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Once you have enabled the Hide Drives In My Computer option in System Policy
Editor, the option cannot be permanently disabled using the default template. If
you disable the option in System Policy Editor, the change stays in effect only
until the next time you start System Policy Editor. After you start System
Policy Editor, the option becomes enabled again when you restart your computer.

System Policy Editor (Poledit.exe) is available in the Admin\Apptools\ Poledit
folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM. Use the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control
Panel to install System Policy Editor.

NOTE: System Policy Editor is not included in the floppy disk version of Windows
95. You can download Policy.exe, a self-extracting executable file containing
Poledit.exe, from online services. Please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base for information about downloading Policy.exe:
