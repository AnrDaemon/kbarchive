The above errors can occur when a Windows NT domain has FPNW Servers that use
the same computer name as the SMS Logon Servers(Windows NT domain controllers).

The FPNW Server Name is the name that NetWare client computers use to refer to
the server. This name must be different than the server's regular server name.

versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. We are currently researching this problem and will
