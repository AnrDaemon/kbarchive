The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you set up a new inventory package by importing Off95std.pdf from the
Primsite.srv\Import.src directory and you inventory a Windows 95 or Windows NT
client that runs Office95, the client's Packages group will not include
Office95.

CAUSE
=====

The inventory rule for Office95 in OFF95STD.PDF uses the Time property set to
12:00PM. It should be 12:00AM.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management
Server version 1.2.
