TITLE   :BUG: Printer Object Font Information is Lost After Printing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting kbVBp kbVBp400bug kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The printer object loses all of its font information, including font size,
boldness, underlining, etc., after an initial call to Printer.Print has been
made.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because of the way the Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me,
Windows NT, and Windows 2000 printer drivers work. They require applications to
re-send printer settings for each page. Visual Basic 4.0 does not automatically
do this.

This behavior is described in the article mentioned in the REFERENCES section
below.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, add the following statements to the beginning of
the Command1_Click procedure, as shown in the following example:

      Sub Command1_click()
        Dim PrinterFont As String   '*
        Printer.Print ""            '* Initialize printer object's device
                                    '* context
        PrinterFont = Printer.Font  '* Retrieve current font name
        Printer.Font = ""           '* Clear current font details
        Printer.Font = PrinterFont  '* Reset font information
        Printer.fontsize = 36
        Printer.fontbold = true
        Printer.fontitalic = true
        Printer.fontunderline = true
        Printer.print "This is a test"
        Printer.enddoc
      End Sub

Each time the CommandButton is pressed, the output should print correctly.

Starting a new page will also reset the Printer's font information to its
defaults, so you will need to reset the printer after each NewPage method. Page
level Information, such as orientation, will not need to be reset.

     ' If you have additional pages, use this syntax:
     Printer.NewPage
     Printer.Print ""     '* Reinitialize printer object's device
     Printer.Font = ""    '* Clear current font details
     Printer.Font = PrinterFont '* Reset font information
     Printer.FontSize = 36
     Printer.CurrentY = 0    '* Reset to the top of the new page
     Printer.Print "This is page two"
     Printer.EndDoc

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start Visual Basic with a New Project.

2. Add a CommandButton to the form.

3. Add the following code to the Click event of the CommandButton:

         Sub Command1_click()
            Printer.Fontsize = 36
            Printer.Fontbold = true
            Printer.Fontitalic = true
            Printer.Fontunderline = true
            Printer.Print "This is a test"
            Printer.Enddoc
         End Sub

4. Run this program and press the CommandButton. The output should have printed
   correctly.

5. Press the CommandButton again. This time the output will have lost all of its
   font attributes.
