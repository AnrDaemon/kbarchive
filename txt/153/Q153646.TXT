PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsmsAdmin smsadmin

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When you begin to run a query and then cancel the query or close the query
results window, the SMS Admin UI may stop responding.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Systems Management Server cannot cancel the query in the middle of a
single SQL statement. The SMS Admin UI regains control once the SQL statement
that was currently executing completes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server versions 1.0 and 1.1. It was corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

Additional query words: prodsms query UI
