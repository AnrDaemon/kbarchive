OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot change the Windows NT account information from within the Microsoft
Exchange client for Macintosh when the profile is configured to use AppleTalk
and the Microsoft Exchange Server is running under Microsoft Windows NT version
3.51.

Note: If the primary domain controller (PDC) is running Windows NT 4.0, please
see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q140641 Updated Samsrv.dll Supports AppleTalk and Banyan Vines Clients


WORKAROUND
==========

There are two ways you can work around this problem:

Workaround 1
------------

1. Open the Chooser and click AppleShare.

2. Select the AppleTalk Zone where the Microsoft Exchange Server is located.

3. Select the appropriate file server name.

4. Click Set Password and follow the prompts.

Workaround 2
------------

1. Make sure MacTCP 2.0.6 or higher, OpenTransport TCP/IP, is configured. This
   can be tested by using MacTCP ping, to make sure the Microsoft Exchange
   Server name can be resolved. Use Ping exchsrvr1.

2. Use TCP/IP in the profile instead of AppleTalk. To do this:

   a. Open the Microsoft Exchange Settings tool.

   b. Click Show Profiles, Add, and Next, and type a name.

   c. Make sure TCP/IP is selected.

   d. Enter the appropriate account and Microsoft Exchange Server name.

   e. Finish creating the profile and make it the profile to be used when
      starting the Microsoft Exchange client.

   f. Close the Microsoft Exchange Settings tool.

3. Start the Microsoft Exchange client.

4. To change the Windows NT password, on the Tools menu, click Options, and
   click Microsoft Exchange Server.

NOTE: This workaround will only work if the PDC is Windows NT version 3.51 or
higher. The Microsoft Exchange Server must also be at Service Pack 2 or later.

Workaround 3
------------

1. Upgrade the Microsoft Exchange Server computer to Windows NT 4.0.

2. Upgrade to Microsoft Exchange Service Pack 2. For information on obtaining
   this Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge
   Base (without the spaces):

   Windows NT PDC.
