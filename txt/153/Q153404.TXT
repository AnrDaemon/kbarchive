SUMMARY
=======

With the Microsoft Exchange client, it is possible to grant other users the
right to access your inbox.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To grant other users access to your inbox:

On your computer:

1. Click the "Mailbox-<username>" folder to highlight it.

2. On the File menu, click Properties.

3. On the Permission tab, click Add in the Name/Role list and add the desired
   user.

   NOTE: Setting the Default user will give everyone on the Microsoft Exchange
   server access to your folders.

4. After you select the user from the address list, click Add, and then click OK
   to accept the addition.

5. Select the desired Permission Roles for that user.

   You have to do this for each level of folders from the top level (usually the
   Mailbox-<username>) to the bottom-level folder, that is, any subfolders
   under Mailbox.

On the computer of the person you are giving access to:

1. On Tools menu, click Services, select the Microsoft Exchange Server
   Information service, and then click Properties.

2. Click the Advanced tab, and then click Add.

3. Type either the e-mail alias name or the user's Display Name.

4. Click OK to return to the mailbox.

Access to your mailbox now appears in the listed available folders.

The person you are giving access to may get the following error message when
trying to open or access the desired folder:

   The set of folders could not be opened. You do not have sufficient permission
   to perform this operation on this object. See the folder contact or your
   system administrator.

You probably have not given that user the correct permission to access your
folder. Make sure you have given the correct permission to all levels of folders
above the desired folder.
