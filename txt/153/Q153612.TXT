If Wsock32.dll Is Missing
-------------------------

If Wsock32.dll is missing from the computer, then extract the file from the

Compact Disc:

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, and then click MS-DOS Prompt.

   (without the quotation marks), where C is the drive on which Windows 95 is
   installed, Windows is the directory in which Windows 95 is installed, and D
   is your CD-ROM drive. (Make the appropriate changes if your system differs.)

   NOTE: Wsock32.dll may be in win95_12.cab if you are extracting the file off of
   the Windows 95 compact disc. In this case, type:

   extract /L c:\<windows>\system d:\win95\win95_12.cab

3. Type "exit" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER to close the MS-DOS
   Prompt.

4. Click the Start button, click Shutdown, click Restart The Computer, and then
   click Yes.

   a. If you have DMF disks, type "extract /L c:\<windows>\system
      a:\win95_12.cab wsock32.dll" (without the quotation marks), where C is the
      drive on which Windows 95 is installed, where Windows is the folder in
      which Windows 95 is installed, and where A is your floppy disk drive.

   b. If you have non-DMF disks, type "extract /L c:\<windows>\system
      a:\win95_19.cab wsock32.dll" (without the quotation marks), where C is the
      drive on which Windows 95 is installed, where Windows is the folder in
      which Windows 95 is installed, and where A is your floppy disk drive.
