SUMMARY
=======

Page 608 of the Visual Basic 4.x Programmers Guide in the Formatting section
indicates that:

   "Each column of the DBGrid control has its own font, border, word-wrap,
   color, and other attributes that can be set without regard to other columns."

This is an error in the documentation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

None of the explicitly mentioned properties can be set on a per-column basis.
The only properties of the DBGrid that can be set on a per-column basis can be
determined as follows:

1. Right-click the DBGrid.

2. Select Properties.

3. On the property sheet, select Columns.

Also, if you select a dbgrid on a form and hit the F1 key, you get a Help file
that contains the erratum.
