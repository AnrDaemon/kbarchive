TITLE   :Password Changed by Mac User not Synchronized with FPNW
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you change a user account's NT domain password from a Macintosh client, the
password is not synchronized with FPNW. If you try to log on to FPNW server from
a Novell client using this account with the new password, the logon will fail.

CAUSE
=====

The Service for Macintosh does not set the Netware compatible encrypted form of
the password stored in the user record.

WORKAROUND
==========

You will need to change the user account password from one of the following:

 - NT's User Manager from a workstation/server that has had FPNW (or FPNW tools)
   installed.

 - From the Change Password dialog from the cntl-alt-delete screen of Windows
   NT.

 - From a Netware compatible client or MS-DOS networking client running the
   chgpass that is included with FPNW.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in NT 3.51 and FPNW version 3.51.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
