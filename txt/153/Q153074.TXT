======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are an administrator for Windows NT 3.50 or a 3.51 Workstation or
standalone Server, and you try to delete all the users from built-in groups such
as Administrators, you will get an error message that says the action can't be
performed on built-in groups.

On domain controllers, however, the administrator can delete everybody from every
group. The built-in groups and accounts can't be deleted, but all the users can
be removed from the group.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is no workaround for this problem in Windows NT 3.50 or Windows NT 3.51.

STATUS
======

This problem is resolved in Windows NT 4.0.
