TITLE   :Netware Compatible Password not Automatically Expired
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When creating new users with the Netware compatible password option enabled, the
expired password option is not automatically set. This occurs with both User
Manager and the command line utility Net User Add.

CAUSE
=====

The Netware password expired flag will be reset every time the password
notification DLL is called. The password notification DLL is de-coupled with
User Manager. The password notification DLL is not called initially when a new
user is created because the password does not exist yet. After the account is
created, select NW compatible properties, and then select Netware compatible
password expired. The value will then stay selected.

RESOLUTION
==========

This is a design limitation of Microsoft Windows NT versions 3.51 and 4.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT versions
3.51 and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
