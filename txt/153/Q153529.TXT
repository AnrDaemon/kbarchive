======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server fails in logging in to SQL Server when you are using
SQL integrated security and attempt to specify an account from a Windows NT
domain that contains an underscore character, for example,
"North_America\bruce."

CAUSE
=====

An underscore ("_") in a domain name is mapped to a backslash ("\") by SQL
Server. For example, the domain account "North_America\bruce" would appear to
SQL Server as "North\America\bruce". For more information, see page 246 in the
"Microsoft SQL Server Administrator's Guide."

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, do either of the following:

 - Use standard security. To do this, perform the following steps:

   1. Start SQL Server Setup.

   2. Select Standard security under Set Security Options.

   For more information, see page 242ff in the "Microsoft SQLServer
   Administrator's Guide."

   -or-

 - Set the underscore character to "not used" by performing the following
   steps:

   1. Start SQL Server Setup.

   2. Under Set Security Options, click Mappings, and set the Set Map_ value to
      "not used."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2.
