SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use the Bulk Copy Program (BCP), a stand- alone
utility that ships with SQL Server. If you need to move large amounts of data
from Visual FoxPro to SQL Server, the Upsizing Wizard may be too slow. The Bulk
Copy Program utility only transfers the data, it does not create the tables. You
can use the Upsizing Wizard to create the tables or create them yourself in
ISQL/W. In order to prepare SQL Server to accept the data using the "fast"
version of BCP, you must execute the sp_dboption system procedure and set the
select into/bulkcopy option to true.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

Following are sample steps using the BCP utility to transfer data from an ASCII
file to SQL Server:

1. Execute from SQL Server:

   " sp_dboption Mydatabase,bulkcopy,true " (without the quotation marks)

2. Create a tab-delimited ASCII file from the Visual FoxPro Table. For example,
   use a low-level routine to output your fields into a text file:

         =FPUTS(fhandle, emp_id + CHR(9) + ;
                last_name + CHR(9) + ;
                first_name + CHR(9) + ;
                title + CHR(9) + ;
                PADR(DTOC(birth_date)+' '+'12:00AM',16,' ') + CHR(9) + ;
                PADR(DTOC(hire_date)+' '+ '12:00AM',16,' ') + CHR(9) + ;
                address + CHR(9) + ;
                city + CHR(9) + ;
                region + CHR(9) + ;
                postalcode + CHR(9) + ;
                STR(salary,12,2)  )

3. Create a bcp Format file necessary to transfer data. For example, from the
   bin directory under SQL Server:

   bcp mydatabase.dbo.employee out c:\temp\emp.txt /Sservename /Usa /Ppassword

   NOTE: This command should be on one line.

4. Follow the prompts, and type "\t" (without the quotation marks) for the field
   terminator for each field.

5. When prompted, save the format file with a meaningful name such as
   employee.fmt.

6. Edit the format file with an MS-DOS editor.

7. Change the second column for each row to SYBCHAR as in the following example
   using employee.fmt:

      6.0
      11
      1       SYBCHAR       0       6       "\t"       1       emp_id
      2       SYBCHAR       0       20      "\t"       2       last_name
      3       SYBCHAR       0       10      "\t"       3       first_name
      4       SYBCHAR       0       30      "\t"       4       title
      5       SYBCHAR       0       16      "\t"       5       birth_date
      6       SYBCHAR       0       16      "\t"       6       hire_date
      7       SYBCHAR       0       60      "\t"       7       address
      8       SYBCHAR       0       15      "\t"       8       city
      9       SYBCHAR       0       15      "\t"       9       region
      10      SYBCHAR       0       10      "\t"      10       postalcode
      11      SYBCHAR       0       8       "\r\n"    11       salary

8. Change the 5th column for the last row to "\r\n" as the end of file marker.

9. Transfer the ASCII file into SQL Server using BCP as follows:

   bcp mydatabase.dbo.employee in c:\temp\employ.txt /femployee.fmt
   /Sservernamec /Usa /P""

10. When completed, set the Bulkcopy option back to FALSE using Step 1 with the
   FALSE parameter.
