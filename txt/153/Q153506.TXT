TITLE   :PRB: Cannot Set Working Directory by Using .ini File
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbSSafe400 kbSSafe500

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Macintosh, versions 4.0a, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Defining a working directory from either the Srcsafe.ini or Ss.ini file does not
work. Any files that are checked out are stored to a different location from
that specified.

CAUSE
=====

The working directory is defined by default by whatever directory is defined in
MPW's Directory menu.

RESOLUTION
==========

Type the following statement in the appropriate .ini file (after a project
section) to cause Visual SourceSafe to use the working directory specified:

   Force_Dir=Yes

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
