SYMPTOMS
========

Visual Basic generates an error message if the MFC Class Wizard's stock Error
event is implemented in a custom OLE Control.

For example, if you go to the OLE Events tab in the MFC Class Wizard and add the
stock Error event, you will get the following definition in the control's ODL
file:

       dispinterface _DTestEvents
       {
        properties:
        //  Event interface has no properties

        methods:
         // NOTE - ClassWizard will maintain event information here.
         //    Use extreme caution when editing this section.
         //{{AFX_ODL_EVENT(CTestCtrl)

         [id(DISPID_ERROREVENT)] void Error(short Number, BSTR*
          Description, SCODE Scode, BSTR Source, BSTR HelpFile,
          long HelpContext, boolean* CancelDisplay);

          .
          .

         //}}AFX_ODL_EVENT
         };

This will generate the following event stub in Visual Basic:

      Private Sub Test1_Error(Number As Integer, Description As String, _
               Scode As Error, Source As String, HelpFile As String, _
               HelpContext As Long, CancelDisplay As Boolean)

      End Sub

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid the error generated by Visual Basic, you need to change the event
definition of the stock error event in the ODL such that the third parameter is
of type long instead of SCODE:

[id(DISPID_ERROREVENT)] void Error(short Number, BSTR* Description, long Scode,
BSTR Source, BSTR HelpFile, long HelpContext,boolean*CancelDisplay);

This will change the third parameter in the Visual Basic event stub from "Scode
As Error" to "Scode As Long," and the error will no longer be generated.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
