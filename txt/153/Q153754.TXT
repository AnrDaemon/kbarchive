TITLE   :XADM: Misleading NDR When Recipient has Incoming Size Limit
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you sent a message a Microsoft Exchange account that has a Maximum Incoming
Message Size limit and the message exceeds this limit, you will receive
Non-Delivery Report (NDR) similar to the following:

   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients:
   Subject: test
   Sent: 7/16/96 2:23:23 PM
   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:
   Curley on 7/16/96 2:23:23 PM
   Either the size of this message exceeds your maximum allowed message size or
   you have exceeded the storage limit on your mailbox.
   [MSEXCH:MSExchangeIS:MARVEL:XMEN]"

MORE INFORMATION
================

Notice that the NDR seems to imply that the sender has exceeded a quota or
message size limit although the sender does not have any restrictions and the
restrictions are on the intended recipient.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
