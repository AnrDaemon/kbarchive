TITLE   :SMS Client Files Not Removed After Upgrade
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup smssetup smsgeneral kbArtTypeINF

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A client deinstall does not remove all of the SMS client files.

CAUSE
=====

If the client has been upgraded the old cl_xx.txt and cl_xx.mod files are not
removed. When a deinstall is initiated SMS may find the old .txt and .mod files
and use those to remove the client files. SMS should instead use the new
client's .txt and .mod files to remove any client files.

For instance, if the client was upgraded from Windows 95 to Windows NT, the
\Ms\Sms\Data directory will still have the CL_W95.txt and CL_W95.mod files along
with the CL_NT.txt and CL_NT.mod files. If the client is then deinstalled SMS
may use the CL_W95.txt and CL_W95.mod for the remove file list instead of
CL_NT.txt and CL_NT.MoD.

RESOLUTION
==========

Manually delete the old client's .txt and .mod files. This has been fixed in
1.2. The client upgrade will now delete the old .txt and .mod files as part of
the upgrade.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. It has been fixed in Systems Management Server version 1.2.
