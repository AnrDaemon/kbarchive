TITLE   :Sender Manager Only Accepts UPPERCASE Site Server Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsmsUtil smsgeneral smsutil kbArtTypeINF

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When you start Sender Manager, the Site Server dialog box prompts for a site
server name. When you enter the site server name, the application capitalizes
the text.

Sender Manager then looks for the uppercase name in the registry of the site
server (SMS\Identification\Site Server). If the site server name is stored in
lowercase, it reports that there is no match.

CAUSE
=====

Although Sender Manager capitalizes the text, the case of the name does not
match the actual registry entry.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

Additional query words: prodsms sender manager servername
