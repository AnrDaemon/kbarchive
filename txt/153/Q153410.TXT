TITLE   :Some Mouse Actions Not Recorded with Capture Next Actions
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:msphone1

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Phone, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use a global or program-specific voice command created with
the Capture Next Actions feature in Microsoft Voice, the mouse actions performed
while creating the voice command may not run correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The Capture Next Actions feature is used to create voice commands by detecting
all the keyboard and mouse actions that occur when you are creating the voice
command. However, when you use the Capture Next Actions feature to create a
voice command, certain mouse actions are not recorded properly. This may result
in the voice command not working as you expect. Some of the mouse actions that
are not recorded include:

 - Drag-and-drop actions (only the positions of the mouse when the mouse button
   is pressed and lifted are recorded).

 - Scroll bar actions (no mouse action is recorded).

 - Title bar actions (neither double-clicking the title bar to maximize a
   program nor moving a window by dragging the title bar is recorded).

 - Desktop actions (clicking an object with the left or right mouse button is
   not recorded).

For example, if you use the mouse to drag a file from Windows Explorer to
WordPad, these actions are recorded by Microsoft Voice as "Press left mouse
button at <cursor location>" and "Lift mouse button at <cursor
location>" but no information about the object you moved is recorded. When
you run the voice command, no object is moved even though the mouse movement and
button actions are executed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Record the voice command again, substituting keyboard actions for mouse actions
as appropriate.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Voice version 1.0. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
