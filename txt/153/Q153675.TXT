-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If a general field contains an embedded or linked Word document, you can print
the Word document by using code and OLE automation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information about the behavior of embedded Word documents, please see
the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q105714 Document Object Margins Default to Zero Inches

   Q121049 Wrong Page Size for Word Document Object Opened to Edit

IMPORTANT: If you are using the APPEND GENERAL command, or Insert Object from the
Edit menu in the general field to create a new Word document, the document may
not print correctly if you do not follow the guidelines published in Microsoft
Knowledge Base article Q105714 (see above).


NOTE: This code sample only works with Word 95. It does not work with Word 97.

Code Sample
-----------

The following code demonstrates how to print the document.

   CREATE TABLE myword (wordfld G)
   APPEND BLANK
   APPEND GENERAL wordfld CLASS "Word.Document"
   ** The above lines are for demonstration only
   ** Normally the table will already exist and contain the document

   frmDummy = CREATEOBJECT("Form")
   frmDummy.ADDOBJECT("objWordDoc","OleBoundControl")
   frmDummy.objWordDoc.ControlSource = "wordfld"
   frmDummy.objWordDoc.DoVerb(1) &&starts an instance of Word
   objWordInst = GETOBJECT("","Word.Basic") &&create a reference to Word
   ** set paper size - see Q121049 referenced above
   objWordInst.FilePageSetup(,,"1","1",,"1","1","8.5 in","11 in")
   objWordInst.Insert("Brown Shoes Don't Make It")
   objWordInst.AppHide
   objWordInst.FilePrint
   WAIT WINDOW "Printing document" TIMEOUT 5
   objWordInst.AppClose
   RELEASE objWordInst
