SUMMARY
=======

The expiration date of a Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) database entry
is different for partners.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a Microsoft WINS enabled client registers its name in its local database,
the expiration date for the entry is calculated by adding the current clock time
and WINS configuration renewal time. The default is 96 hours, or four days, for
Windows NT 3.51; it is 144 hours, or six days, for Windows NT 4.0.

Once this entry replicates to a partner, the entry's expiration date is then
recalculated on the partner. The expiration date used on a replicated entry is
calculated by adding the current clock time on the partner server to the WINS
configuration verify interval on the partner server (the default is 576 hours,
or 24 days).
