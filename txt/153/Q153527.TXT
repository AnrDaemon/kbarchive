TITLE   :PRB: PRTINFO() Function Returns an Incorrect Value
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The PRTINFO(2) function returns an incorrect value when the current printer
driver is set to "Canon Bubble-Jet BJ330" and a user-defined page size (B4 :
250x354mm) is used.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The PRTINFO() function is used to return the current FoxPro for Windows printer
settings. It can accept the values 1, 2, 3, or 4 as parameters. When 1 is passed
to PRTINFO(), the page orientation for the printer is returned if it can be
determined. When 2 is passed to PRTINFO(), the paper size of the printer is
returned if it can be determined. If PRTINFO() cannot determine the paper size,
it should return -1. In this case, PRTINFO(3) and PRTINFO(4) can be used to
determine the paper length and width, respectively.

If the current printer is a Canon Bubble-Jet BJ330 and a user-defined page size
is B4 (250x354mm) for that printer, PRTINFO(2) will return an incorrect value.
This incorrect value is not documented. PRTINFO(2) should return 12.
