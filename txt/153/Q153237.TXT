TITLE   :File Manager Unable to Copy Long File Names to Write-Only Volume
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When File Manager is used to copy files with long names to volumes that you have
Write-Only access to, the short (8.3) name will be used. The write-only volume
may be local or remote.

CAUSE
=====

File Manager attempts to determine whether the destination drive supports long
file names by using the GetVolumeInformation API to collect information about
the destination drive. This API call fails with an Access Denied error when the
destination drive is one for which you do not have read access. Thus, the File
Manager cannot confirm whether long file name support is available. In this
situation, File Manager chooses to use the 8.3 name for the file rather than
attempt to copy the long file name to the destination.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you have read/write access to the root of the volume, the
GetVolumeInformation call will succeed. In this case, no resolution is required.
Otherwise, use one of the following workarounds:

 - If write-only access is required, assigning the write-only access to
   subdirectories of the shared root, where the root has read access, will
   permit files with long names to be copied to the subdirectories with names
   intact.

   -OR-

 - Alternatively, you can use the command-line COPY command. The COPY command
   does not attempt to verify whether long file name support is available before
   attempting to copy files, therefore it is not subject to this limitation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
