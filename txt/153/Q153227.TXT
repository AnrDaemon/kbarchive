TITLE   :SMS: PCM Requires Restart After Running a Package
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPCM smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you run a "Run Command on Workstation" job, the following message appears
on Windows clients:

   Reboot to Complete Installation

   Please close all running applications. The system must be rebooted to complete
   installation. Press ENTER to reboot.

This message appears even though a restart is not required.

CAUSE
=====

The following two files may exist in the Windows directory: _Mssetup.bat and
_Msrstrt.exe. Package Command Manager (PCM) looks for these two files to
determine whether a restart is required. Many setup programs use these files in
the installation process. It is possible that a setup program left them behind.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Setup programs may construct a batch file containing operations that must be
performed during a restart, by using ExitWindowsExec, and then restarting
Windows. In order to set up multiple programs before a restart, PCM prevents the
restart by displaying the message mentioned above, and then performs an
ExitWindowsExec when the user elects to restart. This also gives the user a
chance to save any work.

To copy system files that may be in use, or to coordinate multiple or unattended
setups, the batch file of each setup program can be concatenated to the
_Mssetup.bat file. If _Mssetup.bat does not exist, then the batch file of the
first setup program is renamed to _Mssetup.bat. The _Msrstrt.exe program is
called by ExitWindowsExec and runs the batch file _Mssetup.bat. It then deletes
both the batch file and _Msrstrt.exe.

the Microsoft BackOffice SDK.
