TITLE   :PGC Defaults to Wrong Drive Mode After Period of Inactivity
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother kbPGC smspgc

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


On a Windows 3.1/LAN Manager client, Program Group Control (PGC) launches
Solitaire as a shared application by establishing a connection using the next
available drive letter, even if the drive mode for this sharing package is set
up for "Runs with UNC name" or "Requires Specific Drive Letter." This result
occurs only after you wait 10 to 15 minutes after launching any other PGC shared
package. If the Specified Drive package is launched sooner, the expected results
do occur correctly.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
