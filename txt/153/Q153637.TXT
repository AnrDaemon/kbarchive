TITLE   :Remove Package From Server Job Fails if Files Are in Use
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbDespooler smsdespooler

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a "Remove Package From Server Job" command, the Systems Management
Server Despooler Service cannot delete files that are currently in use. The
Systems Management Server Despooler keeps track of files that cannot be deleted,
and it attempts to "deltree" the files at a later interval. If the distribution
server is a NetWare server and the files are in use, the Systems Management
Server Despooler incorrectly lists the file names. Therefore, the Despooler
fails to completely remove the files from the NetWare distribution server.

The Despool.log file displays a line similar to the following:

   Failed to deltree [ASCII 226]O[ASCII 248]w[ASCII 244][ASCII 239]v, Win32
   Error = 0

Note the file name above.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management
Server version 1.2.
