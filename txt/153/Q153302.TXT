TITLE   :Error Reading Site Control File from Parent Site
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbSCMan smssiteconfigman

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


If a secondary site installation is initiated at the same time the site is set to
report up to a parent site, the secondary site will appear to be under
construction at both the child and parent sites. However, when the secondary
site installation completes and reports status to the child site, the parent
site never receives the updated status for the secondary site installation at
the child site. Instead, the SMS Administrator will report an error reading the
site control file if you attempt to look at the secondary site properties from
the parent site's SMS Administrator.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
