TITLE   :TrueImage Errors When Printing from a Macintosh
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.10 3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print from a Macintosh to a non-PostScript print queue on a Windows NT
Server, you may receive the following error message:

   ID 4014
   source- macprint
   type- error
   Category- TrueImage print
   The TrueImage interpreter was unable to query the font list correctly to begin
   processing job.

CAUSE
=====

The PostScript interpreter in Windows NT 3.51 expects the PostScript format of
the Macintosh to follow the LaserWriter Plus standard. This is usually not a
problem because that is the printer (ppd) that defaults under Macintosh
Services. However, if you have changed that default, you will get the ID 4014
error as described above.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the driver back to the default, that is, LaserWriter Plus. This should
not adversely affect the print quality.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.x. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
