TITLE   :Add-in Display Adapters and Motorola Powerstack Computers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install an add-in display adapter on a Motorola Powerstack PowerPC
computer system, the new display adapter is not recognized by the system,
resulting in no video display.

CAUSE
=====

A problem exists in an older firmware revision (version 2.06a) that prevents
many ISA/PCI video cards from working. This firmware has limited support for
third-party video adapters because it cannot emulate the x86 code found in the
card's BIOS.

RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain the latest firmware revision (version 3.03.0x or later) from your
Motorola vendor or from Motorola directly. You can access the Motorola web page
on the Internet at http://www.mot.com.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The specific BIOS revision can be identified by the following behavior:

 - Version 2.06a starts with several system tests on a black screen, which
   transitions to another black screen with white lettering that displays the
   text "Version 2.06a" and continues with a blue screen and a small set of menu
   selections in white letters.

 - Version 3.03.0x boots to a screen with a bitmap background and two small
   windows. The upper window gives the version information and the lower window
   shows a small set of menu selections. This firmware does have x86 emulation,
   which supports cards that have Intel code in the BIOS.

The third-party products discussed here are manufactured by vendors independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
