If a project is shared and then later branched (as a separate step), the branch
or separate option is not available from the toolbar.

To be able to branch the project, you must select the project and then select
all the project's files.

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start Visual SourceSafe.

2. Select a project, and then right-click the project. Note that the share
   dialog box including the Branch or Separate Option is available.

If the project is shared and then later branched (in Visual SourceSafe version
4.0) or separated (in SourceSafe version 3.X), the shared project must be
selected first, and then all of the project files must be selected. If files are
not selected, the branch (or separate) option is not available.
