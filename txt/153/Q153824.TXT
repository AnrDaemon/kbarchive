TITLE   :CPS Winntp Ignores Defaults.inf During Profile
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - MSPRESS Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit, versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you're using the Windows NT Computer Profile Setup utility (CPS), the
Answer file is ignored during the Winntp.exe portion of setup. Network settings
are bypassed and often the computer displays dialog boxes prompting you for such
information as the machine name and user name.

CAUSE
=====

The values are now being ignored even though they may have worked previously.
This is caused by profiling a system with Winntp then making changes to the
configuration of that same computer and running Uplodprf.exe to upload those
changes onto the distribution server.

There is a key in the registry (at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\Setup) that shows
the command line setup uses. A normal setup (winnt /b, floppy initiated) will
show:

   CmdLine: REG_SZ: setup -g -i initial.inf... (partial line shown)

A profiled setup (Winntp.exe initiated) will show:

   CmdLine: REG_SZ: setup -g -i profile.inf...

WORKAROUND
==========

Make all changes to the master system, not the target systems.
