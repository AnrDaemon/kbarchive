TITLE   :PGC Cannot Find Server with NetWare, WFWNET, LANMan Connections
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPGC smspgc

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


If you have a NetWare, "WFWNET," and LAN Manager connection on a Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 computer, the Program Group Control (PGC) is unable to find a
server.


CAUSE
=====

APPCTL16.EXE and APPSTART.EXE cannot call NWGetDriveStatus in SMSNETNW.DLL to
enumerate the drive connections that exist. It starts with the lowest letter,
which is a LAN Manager or "WFWNET" connection. This returns error code 18, which
causes the symptom mentioned above.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, remove the LAN Manager or "WFWNET" connection.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
