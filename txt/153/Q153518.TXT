======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


On a Windows 95 system with an older Compaq Qvision video card, running the
Remote Control tool (Wuser.exe) can cause font display and screen redraw
problems. Text in menus is not displayed correctly and when applications are
minimized, garbage is left on the screen.

These problems occur at higher resolutions and color depths. Standard VGA
resolution 640x480 16 colors works correctly.

WORKAROUND
==========

The current workaround is to use 640x480 16 colors video resolution.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
