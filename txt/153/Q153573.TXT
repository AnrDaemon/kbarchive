TITLE   :If Data Loader Loses Its Link to SQL, Good MIFs May Be Rejected
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:smsgeneral kbArtTypeINF

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


If the Inventory Data Loader process loses its connection to SQL, it is possible
that the MIF that the Inventory Data Loader was processing might be treated as a
BADMIF and consequently not be processed; the MIF will instead be placed in the
BADMIF subdirectory. Once the SQL connection is re- established, the affected
MIF can be moved back to the Deltamif.col directory and subsequently be
processed.

The following is a sample from the Inventory Data Loader log file:

   Waiting for a MIF...
   finished processing current machine.
   Cannot process MIF 00000000.MIF, moving it to BADMIFS
   finished processing current machine.
   SQL problem detected, terminating the thread.
   SQL problem detected, terminating UMF processing thread.
   Processing a machine...

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. It has been fixed in Systems Management Server version 1.2.
