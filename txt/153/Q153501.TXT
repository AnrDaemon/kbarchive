SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Visual SourceSafe Explorer, the following message may appear
before or after you're prompted to log in:

   "Error reading from file"

CAUSE
=====

One possible cause is that the Names.dat file is corrupted. This file contains
the long filenames of both projects and files in the SourceSafe database.

RESOLUTION
==========

At the command prompt, type:

      analyze -f <path to data folder>

For example:

      analyze -f s:\\vss\data


STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
