======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network versions 2.6, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you upgraded from MSN 2.5 or earlier, when you attempt to connect to MSN, The
Microsoft Network, you may receive the following error message:

   Cannot locate the Microsoft Network Data Center.

The following behavior may also occur:

 - Microsoft Internet Explorer version 2.0 may be unable to resolve Web site
   addresses (such as www.msn.com and www.microsoft.com). When this occurs, you
   may receive the following error message:

   Unable to locate the site <site name>

 - When you ping a Domain Name Server (DNS) name (such as www.msn.com or
   www.microsoft.com), you may receive the following error message:

   Bad IP Address.

   However, you can successfully ping numerical DNS and Internet Protocol (IP)
   addresses.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur because earlier versions of MSN have been discontinued.
Files from these earlier versions can create this problem.

NOTE: This error does not occur with MSN version 2.6 or later.

RESOLUTION
==========

The best way to resolve this problem is to install the latest version of MSN
Explorer. This installation will remove old files and install software that does
not have this problem and that will be automatically upgraded in the future. To
install MSN Explorer, go to
    http://explorer.msn.com

Otherwise, to resolve this problem, remove files left from the earlier version of
MSN and install MSN version 5.x.

To remove files from earlier versions

You are going to need a copy of the Windows software your computer is running.
This can be found on your hard drive or on a Windows CD-Rom included with your
computer at the time of purchase.

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then click
   Add/Remove Programs.

2. Under the Install/Uninstall tab, if you see MSN, the Microsoft Network, click
   it and click Add/Remove, and then click Yes.

3. Under the Windows Setup tab, if you see The Microsoft Network clear the
   checkbox for it, and then click OK.

Windows may now copy system files. At System settings change, you must restart
your computer message click Yes.
Insert the MSN 5.x CD and follow the prompts to install the software.
