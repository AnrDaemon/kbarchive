TITLE   :FIX: Exception in DrawCli When Displaying Summary Information
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.1,4.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When displaying the Summary Info for an existing DrawCli file with Summary Info
saved, DrawCli may crash with the following error:

   Unhandled Exception : Access Violation

DrawCli is an MFC OLE sample that is shipped with Visual C++.

CAUSE
=====

CSummInfo::ReadFromStorage does not set CSummInfo::m_pSection. This behavior
leaves a dangling pointer into memory that has been deleted.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the ReadFromStorage as follows:

      BOOL CSummInfo::ReadFromStorage( LPSTORAGE lpRootStg )
      {
          if (lpRootStg != NULL)
          {
              LPSTREAM lpStream = NULL;

              if (FAILED(lpRootStg->OpenStream( szSummInfo,
                         NULL, STGM_SHARE_EXCLUSIVE|STGM_READ,
                         0, &lpStream )))
              {
                  TRACE(_T("OpenStream failed\n"));
                  return FALSE;
              }
              else
              {
                  if (!m_propSet.ReadFromStream( lpStream ))
                  {
                      TRACE(_T("ReadFromStream failed\n"));
                      return FALSE;
                  }
      // add the following line
                  m_pSection = m_propSet.GetSection(FMTID_SummaryInformation);

                  lpStream->Release();
                  return TRUE;
              }
          }
          return FALSE;
      }

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 4.2.
