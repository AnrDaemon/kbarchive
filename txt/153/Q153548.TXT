TITLE   :SCSI Drives Using FAT32 Should Be Repartitioned When Moved
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:diskmem win95 kbDiskMemory

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you move a SCSI hard disk formatted with the FAT32 file system from one
SCSI controller to another controller, you may not be able to reliably write
data to and read data from the hard disk.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you partition and format a hard disk using a SCSI
controller that fully supports interrupt 13 extensions and you then move the
hard disk to a controller that does not fully support the interrupt 13
extensions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To move a drive using the FAT32 file system to a different controller, you must
verify that both controllers fully support interrupt 13 extensions in the same
manner. If they do not, data loss may occur.

Microsoft only supports the use of fixed media on the same controller used to
partition and format the media.

NOTE: This information does not apply to removable media.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 95 uses logical block addressing (LBA) on most SCSI drives to access
data. With drives using the FAT32 file system with interrupt 13 extensions,
Windows 95 depends on the BIOS to fully support the interrupt 13 extensions.

This problem typically occurs only with drives 8 gigabytes and larger in size.
