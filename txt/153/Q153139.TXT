TITLE   :Removing Deleted or Renamed Servers from License Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Domain controllers that have been renamed or removed from Server manager still
appear in the Server Browser of License Manager, even though you expect these
domain controllers to disappear from the list.

CAUSE
=====

This information is replicated from the domain controllers to the primary domain
controller or Enterprise server.

RESOLUTION
==========

Stop the License Logging service, delete or rename the Llsuser.lls file in the
%Systemroot%\System32\Lls directory, and then restart the License Logging
service.

This procedure will clear all the entries for domain controllers and users that
have connected to the server. It will not reset your purchase history or any
license groups you have created.
