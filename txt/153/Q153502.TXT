TITLE   :PRB: Unable to Open Project Error When Running Analyze
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER::95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtshoot kbusage kbSSafe

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 95 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Running Analyze returns the following error message:

   "Unable to open project <DOS path>\a\aaaaaaaa" Continue Y?

CAUSE
=====

The analyze utility is unable to find the database.

RESOLUTION
==========

Ensure that Analyze is pointing to the correct database location. It should
include DATA. For example, if the database resides on a file server mapped to
drive F:

   Analyze -i- f:\VSS\data

The full syntax is:

   ANALYZE [-B<directory>] [-C] [-F] [-I-] [-V] [-X] [-?] [-H] <Full
   Database Path>

This particular message is corrected in later revisions of Analyze.exe. However,
later versions of Analyze (specifically 1309 or above) also fail if you don't
include the data directory as part of the entire path to the Database. In that
case, the following error appears:

   "File '<Path Used>\version.dat' not found"

where the Version.dat file is located in the data directory. For more information
about the newest analyze utility, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q190881 SAMPLE: Analyze6.exe Utility for Visual SourceSafe

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
