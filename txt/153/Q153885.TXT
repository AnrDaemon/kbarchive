KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Phone, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure the NUM LOCK, CAPS LOCK, or SCROLL LOCK key on the keyboard
to activate the Push-to-Talk feature in Microsoft Voice, the original function
of the key may become "locked" in either the on or off state. The indicator
light for the key may or may not reflect the current state of the key.

For example, if you configure the CAPS LOCK key to activate the Push-to- Talk
feature, when you press the CAPS LOCK key to activate Push-to-Talk, the CAPS
LOCK function may turn on and remain on. When this occurs, you cannot disable
the CAPS LOCK function and the CAPS LOCK indicator may remain lit.

CAUSE
=====

The state of the key is set the first time the key is pressed, but does not
change upon subsequent key presses.

RESOLUTION
==========

Configure a different key to activate the Push-to-Talk feature.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem may also occur when system resources are very low, or when the
processor is busy.
