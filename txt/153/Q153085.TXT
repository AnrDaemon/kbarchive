TITLE   :SMS: MIFs Not Collected on OS/2 Clients with Multiple Drives
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Client MIF files stored in the Noidmifs directory are not collected on computers
running OS/2, if the Systems Management Server client software has been
installed on a drive other than drive C. Forms that are filled out with the MIF
Entry program are stored as MIF files in the Ms\Sms\Noidmifs directory.

CAUSE
=====

The Systems Management Server client setup for OS/2 (Cli_os2.exe) determines the
drive on which to install the Ms\Sms directory structure. For example, if drive
D has more free space, Systems Management Server will install on drive D, and
that fact will be reflected in the Sms.ini file.

When the OS/2 inventory program (Invos2.exe) runs, it looks exclusively for MIF
files in the C:\Ms\Sms\Noidmifs directory. If it does not find this directory
structure, it creates the directory structure.

The result is a complete Ms\Sms directory structure on both drive D and drive C
that contains the following subdirectories and file:

   \Noidmifs
   \Idmifs
   Cmndhist.os2

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, force the Systems Management Server client to be
installed on drive C of each OS/2 client. For more information on this
procedure, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q127072 Installing SMS Client to Drive Other Than Most Free Disk Space

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
