 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 4.0, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When calling the COleDateTime::Format member function with VAR_DATEVALUEONLY or
VAR_TIMEVALUEONLY, you will get the following compiler error:

   

   error C2668: 'Format' : ambiguous call to overload function (new
                           behaviour; please see help)

CAUSE
=====

The problem is caused by not defining VAR_DATEVALUEONLY and VAR_TIMEVALUEONLY as
DWORD in Oleauto.h.

RESOLUTION
==========

The workaround is to type cast these constants to DWORD.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
