KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51

SUMMARY
=======

While trying to load any Windows NT Service Pack on a PowerPC platform you may
encounter the following error:

   A non-critical error has occurred, external library Getdest.dll could not
   process os loader boot variable.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The routine that is called from Getdest.dll is GetOsLoaderDest, and this error
message means that one of the following nonvolatile random access memory (NVRAM)
variables is not set correctly:

   SYSTEMPARTITION
   OSLOADER
   OSLOADPARTITION
   OSLOADFILENAME

Sample entries:

SYSTEMPARTITION multi(0)scsi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(2)
OSLOADER multi0)scsi0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(2)\OS\winnt\osloader.exe
OSLOADPARTITION multi(0)scsi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(3)
OSLOADFILENAME \winnt

Additionally a drive letter must be assigned to the file allocation table (FAT)
partition containing the Osloader.exe file in order for the Service Pack to
install properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Follow your PowerPC manufacturer's hardware guide to enter the computer's NVRAM
and verify the above NVRAM variables contain valid information.

STATUS
======

The PowerPC is manufactured by International Business Machines Corporation, a
vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
