TITLE   :Office95 Professional Falsely Reported in Inventory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbAudit kbInventory smsinv smsaudit

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you inventory MSOffice on a client that runs any version of Microsoft
Office other than Microsoft Office95 Professional, the client's Properties for
Packages will show that the client has Office Professional installed.

CAUSE
=====

The inventory rule in the package definition file (PDF) for Office95
Professional has only one rule with the file name Msoffice.exe. Since versions
of Office have an executable file named Msoffice.exe, all versions will be
inventoried as Office95 Professional.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the PDF that comes with MSOffice95 Professional.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management
Server version 1.2.
