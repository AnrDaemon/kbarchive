KEYWORDS:kbpolicy kbprint win95 kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to a PostScript printer, blank pages may not be printed. If you
try to print a 3-page document with one blank page, only the two pages that are
not blank may be printed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by a problem with the Windows 95 PostScript printer
driver.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

 - Insert text on a page that you want to be blank, and then format the color of
   that text to be white.

 - Install the Windows 3.x PostScript driver. For information about using
   Windows 3.x drivers in Windows 95, please see the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q132946 How to Install Windows 3.1 Drivers in Windows 95

   NOTE: Windows 3.x printer drivers cannot take advantage of some of the
   printing enhancements in Windows 95.

STATUS
======

This issue is resolved in Microsoft Windows 98.
