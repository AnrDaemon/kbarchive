SYMPTOMS
========

When you are viewing drives in My Computer, one or more of the drives may have
an incorrect icon associated with it. When you double-click the icon to view the
contents of the drive, the following error message may be displayed:

   Program Not Found
   Windows cannot find Autorun.exe.
   This program is needed for opening files of type 'File'.

You are then prompted for the location of the Autorun.exe file.

CAUSE
=====

An Autorun.inf file exists in the root folder of the drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

Delete or rename the Autorun.inf file in the root folder of the affected drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Autorun.inf file is used with CD-ROMs to automatically run specified
programs. When a non-CD-ROM drive contains an Autorun.inf file, AutoPlay is
started when you double-click the drive's icon. AutoPlay attempts to load
Autorun.exe (which is not present) to read the Autorun.inf file.

If the Autorun.exe file is also present in the root folder, the actions specified
in the Autorun.inf file are carried out if possible.

Additional query words: autoplay.exe
