TITLE   :SMS: Data Loader Uses UPDATE STATISTICS Command Multiple Times
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbDataLoader smsdataloader

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


The SQL Server updates the index statistics on some SMS tables during every Data
Loader service processing cycle. This almost constant updating is inefficient
and could adversely impact the performance of SQL and SMS on sites that process
a large number of systems and MIF files.

CAUSE
=====

The SMS Data Loader issues an UPDATE STATISTICS command to the SQL Server during
every processing cycle. In most cases, this is done to keep SQL Server indexes
efficient. Since this is done during every Data Loader processing cycle, this
could impact SQL Server and SMS Data Loader performance.

RESOLUTION
==========

This has been fixed in SMS 1.2. The SMS 1.2 DATA LOADER service will issue this
command to the SMS tables every 48 hours between the hours of 12:00am to 5:00am.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management
Server version 1.2.
