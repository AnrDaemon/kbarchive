PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


A program group created by Systems Management Server for a shared network
application is not deleted for more than one user on an Windows NT client
computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a program group is created by Systems Management Server Program Group Control
(PGC) for two or more users logging on to the same Windows NT computer (and then
the program group properties are changed in the SMS Administrator program so
that it is not available to either user), PGC removes only the group from the
profile of the first user that runs PGC.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, delete the program group manually.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
