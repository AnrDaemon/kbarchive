TITLE   :RAS Server Fails to Autodisconnect Inactive RAS Clients With TCP
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Your Windows NT Remote Access (RAS) Server fails to disconnect idle RAS clients
that have dialed in using the TCP/IP protocol or a combination of the TCP/IP
protocol with IPX or NetBEUI.

CAUSE
=====

When the TCP/IP protocol is used over the RAS connection, a Host Announcement
from the RAS client causes the RAS server to reset the RAS Autodisconnect
timer.

On a Windows NT machine, the Announce parameter defaults to 720 seconds (or 12
minutes). On a Windows NT RAS server, the RAS Autodisconnect parameter defaults
to 20 minutes. If your RAS client is also a Windows NT machine, the RAS
Autodisconnect timer will reset every 12 minutes, and therefore, the RAS client
will never timeout.

If you do not use the TCP/IP protocol over the RAS connection, a Host
Announcement from the RAS client will not cause the RAS Autodisconnect parameter
to reset.

By design, the RAS Autodisconnect parameter sets the time interval after which
inactive connections are terminated. This inactivity is measured by lack of
NetBIOS session data transfer. A Host Announcement is not considered NetBIOS
session activity.

RESOLUTION
==========

Configure the value of the RAS Autodisconnect parameter so that it is less than
the value of the Announce parameter (which specifies the interval of time that a
server uses between sending out a Host Announcement).

WARNING: Using the Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of the Registry Editor
can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

The Announce parameter can be configured via the following Registry parameter:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM

      \CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\parameters

         Announce   REG_DWORD   1 to 65535 seconds, Default: 720

The RAS Autodisconnect parameter can be configured via the following Registry
parameter:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM

      \CurrentControlSet\Services\RemoteAccess\parameters

         Autodisconnect   REG_DWORD   0 to 1000 minutes, Default: 20

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
