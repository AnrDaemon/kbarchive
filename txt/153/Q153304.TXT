TITLE   :USERTSR and USERIPX Options in Documentation Incorrect
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbdocerr smsdocerr

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


The documentation for the USERTSR and USERIPX options section in the "SMS
Administrator's Guide" is incorrect concerning /v and /y.

Page 389 states the following:

"/vflag" should read: "/v flag" -- the space is required

example:    usetsr /vVIEW       should be   usertsr /v VIEW
            usertsr /vNOVIEW    should be   usertsr /v NOVIEW

"/yflag" should read "/V flag" -- it is a capital V instead of y and a
space is required

example:    usertsr /yAUDIBLE   should be   usertsr /V AUDIBLE
            usertsr /yNOVIEW    should be   usertsr /V NOAUDIBLE

example:    usertsr /l2 /vVIEW /yNOAUDIBLE   should be   usertsr /l2 /v
VIEW /V NOAUDIBLE

The following line:

   Note that remote access and local flags (/v and /y options) can be set . . .

should read:

   Note that remote access and local flags (/v and /V options) can be set . . .

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
