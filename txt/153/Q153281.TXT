SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Forms Designer for Microsoft Exchange clients uses two files,
MAPIForm.VBX and MSRICHED.VBX, which are implemented as Microsoft Visual Basic
custom controls. These custom controls are not supported on Visual Basic
projects that have not been created with the Microsoft Forms Designer.

This is due to the dependency that the controls have to the Microsoft Exchange
messaging specific code generated from an install of a Forms Designer project.
