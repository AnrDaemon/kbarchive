TITLE   :XADM: Error When Selecting Security Tab for Mailbox.
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc4 exc5

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to select the Security tab of the properties page for a
Microsoft Exchange recipient in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program,
after properly configuring the Microsoft Exchange Key Management (KM) Server,
the following error might appear:

   Stop: The specified module could not be found.
   Microsoft Windows NT
   ID no: 0xc002007e

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program cannot
access Secadmin.dll. This file must be located in the <exchange_root>\bin
directory and the error will be displayed if the file is not present or is
damaged.

The KM Server Setup program will install a copy of Secadmin.dll in the
\security\bin directory, however, the file is also copied the
<exchange_root>\bin directory during the Microsoft Exchange Server
installation and it must remain there for KM Server administration to function
properly.

The error also shows when selecting the "Key Management Server Administrator"
button from the "Security" tab in the Encryption object found under the
Configuration container.

To solve the problem simply copy SECADMIN.DLL from the \security\bin directory
into the <exchange_root>\bin directory.
