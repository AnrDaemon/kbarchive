TITLE   :Quick Viewer Resizes Incorrectly During Remote Control
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


During a remote-control session, when you change from a DOS window to DOS full
screen, the Quick Windows Viewer resizes correctly. However, when changing from
DOS full screen to a DOS window, Quick Viewer (QV) does not resize correctly,
giving only a partial view of the client's screen. The QV window does not allow
rubber-banding and does not display the Maximize button.

In SMS 1.1, the workaround is to minimize then maximize, which then shows the
correct view.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
