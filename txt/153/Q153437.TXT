The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 1.0, 2.0 for Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Internet Explorer version 2.0 for Windows NT 3.51

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to connect to your Internet Information Server (IIS) web site via
Internet Explorer with only the server name as a URL you will get the following
the error message:

   You are not allowed to access this server.

CAUSE
=====

The default document that you have specified in your directory set up does not
exist.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Go to the IIS Manager and double click the web server. Select the Directories
   property tab.

   NOTE: The name of the default document and that the Enable Default Document
   check box is selected.

2. Check the home directory listed in the directory list to be sure that the
   default document file is there.

   A default document is included with IIS. It is not placed in the wwwroot
   directory by default as it is only a sample. The wwwroot directory is
   generally the home directory for the IIS web server.
