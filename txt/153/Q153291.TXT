SYMPTOMS
========

You may see the message "Not a valid password" displayed when AppWizard or
ClassWizard are used to create a CDaoRecordset-derived class.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Access database file being used to generate the class is secure
and AppWizard and ClassWizard fail to prompt for a user name and password before
trying to open the database.

RESOLUTION
==========

Relax the security on the database so the Wizards won't fail.

-or-

Create another database that has a duplicate schema to be used for generating
classes

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
