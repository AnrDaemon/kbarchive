SUMMARY
=======

Q. Will Visual SourceSafe 5.0 be able to read a Visual SourceSafe 6.0 database?

A. Visual SourceSafe 5.0 and 4.0a clients can read a Visual SourceSafe 6.0
database if the Visual SourceSafe 6.0 database has not been upgraded to the new
database format. Initially, when you create a new Visual SourceSafe 6.0 database
or upgrade from a previous version of the database, you are asked if you would
like to upgrade to the new database format. Click No if you want your Visual
SourceSafe 5.0 and 4.0a clients to be able to read a Visual SourceSafe 6.0
database. If your clients receive an "Incompatible database version" error
message after upgrading to Visual SourceSafe 6.0, the database format might have
been inadvertently upgraded. There is a command line utility named Ddupd.exe,
located in the win32 directory of the Visual SourceSafe server. This utility has
an -undo switch that converts the database from a 6.0 format to a 4.0a or 5.0
format. The syntax is:

   ddupd.exe <path to data directory> -undo
