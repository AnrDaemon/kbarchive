PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.00 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.00 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set up Windows NT 3.51 on an IBM Personal Computer Power Series 850
(Motorola PowerPC 604, 133Mhz) equipped with an IDE hard drive and CD-ROM drive,
you receive the following stop error message during the initial kernel-load
screen:

   Stop 0x0000007b INACCESIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE

CAUSE
=====

The IBM Power 850 systems have an IDE controller which is not compatible with
the Microsoft release of Windows NT 3.51. The IBM OEM-version of Windows NT 3.51
(called IBM PowerManage NT 3.51) has a fixed Atapi.sys that was not included in
the Microsoft distribution of Windows NT 3.51

RESOLUTION
==========

If you want to run Windows NT version 3.51, you must obtain IBM PowerManage NT
3.51. The IBM Power 850 system IS NOT listed on the Windows NT 3.51 Hardware
Compatibility List.

If you want to run version Windows NT 4.00, the IBM Power 850 system computer IS
listed on the Windows NT 4.00 Hardware Compatibility List. Windows NT 4.00 can
be correctly set up on the IBM Power 850 system computer.

STATUS
======
