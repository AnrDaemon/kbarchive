BUG #: 15563 (2.65.0201)

SYMPTOMS
========

When a 16-bit ODBC application calls SQLTables() using the Microsoft SQL Server
ODBC Driver version 2.65.0201 set in asynchronous mode, a "Timeout expired"
error message appears immediately after the second async retry.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs with any network library configuration and Windows NT local
pipes. The Timeout error message also appears regardless of other login or query
timeouts you configure on the client computer.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, upgrade to Microsoft SQL Server ODBC Driver version
2.65.0212, included in Microsoft SQL Server version 6.5 Service Pack 1.

To work around this problem, do not call the ODBC driver in asynchronous mode.
This can be done with different applications and they apply as follows:

 - For ODBC programs written directly to the ODBC API, call SQLSetStmtOption()
   with SQL_ASYNC_ENABLE (set to SQL_ASYNC_ENABLE_OFF).

 - For Visual Basic 3.0 and Access 2.0 applications, set DisableAsync to 1 in
   the [ODBC] section of in the Vb.ini, App.ini or Msacc20.ini respectively.

 - For Visual Basic 4.0, set the INIPATH property of DBENGINE to point to Vb.ini
   or App.ini that has DisableAsync set to 1.

For MSACC20.INI entry settings applicable to Access 95, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q139044 INF: How to Add Former MSACC20.INI ODBC Section to Registry

Jet 3.x (a base component of Access 95 and Visual Basic 4.0) registry information
is on Appendix C of the Microsoft Jet Database Engine Programmer's Guide. You
can obtain Jet 2.x database engine information from the Microsoft Developer
Network Library Level 1 by querying the following:

You can also reference the Technical Backgrounder called "Jet Database Engine
ODBC Connectivity."

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft client/server database applications, such as Access 2.0, Visual Basic
3.0 and Visual Basic 4.0 (16-bit), are designed on top of the Jet Database
engine. Therefore, they attempt to make calls to SQLTables() during several ODBC
operations, which include attaching to a SQL Server 6.5 table. These
applications utilize ODBC in asynchronous mode, by default. Unless the default
asynchronous behavior is turned off, the "Timeout Expired" error message will
occur with the driver version 2.65.0201.

NOTE: Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Query are not designed on top of the Jet
Database engine, thus the problem does not occur.

For more information about the Jet Database Engine, please refer to the Microsoft
Jet Database Engine Programmer's Guide published by Microsoft Press. The ISBN
number is 1-55615-877-7. You can order guide by calling (800) MSP-RESS.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SQL Server ODBC Driver
version 2.65.0201. This problem was corrected in Microsoft SQL Server ODBC
Driver version 2.65.0212. For more information, contact your primary support
provider.
