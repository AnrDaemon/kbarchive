SUMMARY
=======

You may want to have the 16-bit Windows on Windows subsystem start automatically
when you start up the Windows NT Server. Although this is the default on Windows
NT workstation, it is not the default on Windows NT Server. A change in the
registry is required to make the Windows on Windows subsystem start on boot.
This change is also required in order to start any 16-bit processes not started
from the GUI interface, if it is the first 16- bit process started on Windows
NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To start the Windows on Windows subsystem automatically on startup, add the
following command to the registry:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey in the
   system registry:

   System/Software/Microsoft/Windows NT/CurrentVersion/Winlogon

3. Edit the value Userinit and add ",win.com wowexec" to the end of the string.

4. Restart the computer.
