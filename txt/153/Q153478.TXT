The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use the client utilities provided with File and Print Services
for NetWare (FPNW) from an FPNW server without Gateway Services for NetWare
(GSNW) installed, you will receive the following errors:

 - When running MAP:
   Unexpected error 0x89ff during GetDriveStatus

 - When running CAPTURE:
   Unexpected error 0x89ff during PSJobGetDefault

 - When running SLIST:
   Unexpected error 0x89ff during ScanBinderyObject

 - When running LOGIN:
   Unexpected error 0x88ff during GetFileServerName

CAUSE
=====

FPNW provides these utilities for NetWare client compatibility. FPNW alone
provides NetWare Core Protocol (NCP) server services. GSNW is required for NCP
client services.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install GSNW on the FPNW server.
