RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, replace both of the above files on your hard drive with

NOTE: You must first remove or rename any existing copies of Commdlg.dll or
Comdlg32.dll from the Windows\System folder. For more information about how to
accomplish this task in Windows, please see your Windows printed documentation
or online Help.

To extract the file Commdlg.dll, do the following:

   file in the appropriate floppy disk or CD-ROM drive.

2. Click the Start button, point to Programs, and then click MS-DOS Prompt.

      cd\windows\system

4. Type the following command for your floppy disk or compact disc:

    - Floppy Disk:

      Type the following and press ENTER:

      extract <drive>:\Precopy1.cab Commdlg.dll

      where <drive> is the letter of your floppy disk drive.

    - Compact Disc:

      Type the following and press ENTER:

      extract <drive>:\win95\Precopy1.cab Commdlg.dll

      where <drive> is the letter of your CD-ROM drive.

To extract the file Comdlg32.dll, do the following:

1. Insert the Windows 95 floppy disk or compact disc containing the Win95_11.cab
   file in the appropriate floppy disk or CD-ROM drive.

2. Click the Start button, point to Programs, and then click MS-DOS prompt.

3. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER:

      cd\windows\system

4. Type the following command for your floppy disk or compact disc:

    - Floppy Disk:

      Type the following and press ENTER:

      extract <drive>:\Win95_11.cab Comdlg32.dll

      where <drive> is the letter of your floppy disk drive.

      Type the following and press ENTER:

      extract <drive>:\win95\Win95_11.cab Comdlg32.dll

      where <drive> is the letter of your CD-ROM drive.

When both files are extracted, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt
and press ENTER:

   exit

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you still receive the error message, you can correct the problem by
reinstalling Windows 95. However, this should be used as a last resort.
Reinstalling Windows resets many of your custom settings to the Windows
defaults.

For more information about how to reinstall Windows 95, please see your Windows
printed documentation or online Help.
