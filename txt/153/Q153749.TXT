TITLE   :No Single-Route Broadcast on Token Ring with Windows 95 TCP/IP
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbpolicy win95kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a Token Ring network with Windows 95, ARP resolves addresses
by first performing a local broadcast and then an All-Routes broadcast, but it
does not perform a Single-Route broadcast.

CAUSE
=====

The TCP/IP transport protocol included with Windows 95 uses this method of
address resolution to prevent any problems that may occur with older routing
bridges.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

TCP/IP resolves IP addresses to node (MAC) addresses using the ARP protocol. The
All-Routes broadcasts by the ARP protocol do not take advantage of intelligent
source-routing bridges that can route broadcasts through the single best route
and avoid redundant network traffic.

With this update, a Single-Route broadcast is made instead of an All- Routes
broadcast if the following registry string value is present and set to a value
of "1":

   HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\MSTCP\ArpTRSingleRoute
