TITLE   :Single Quotation Mark in NetWare Domain Name Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbHMan smshiermankbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


A NetWare domain name that includes a single quotation mark (for example, "TEST'S
NW DOM") is added as a domain but never shows up in the site's window. Computers
in that domain are identified in a pop-up dialog as belonging to a domain that
does not exist.

CAUSE
=====

Hierarchy Manager fails to add a domain name if the domain name contains a
single quotation mark. The Hman.log file shows multiple attempts to put the
NetWare domain name "TEST'S NW DOM" into the database, but it fails with SQL
errors that reference invalid SQL syntax.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
