TITLE   :SMS: Deleting Computers Fails with "Out Of Locks" Errors
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbConfig kbDatabase kbsmsAdmin smsadmin smsgeneral smsconfig smsdatabase kbArtTypeINFkb

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Deleting a large number of computers from the SMS Administrator tool fails with
"out of locks" errors. No computers are deleted, and the following error is
displayed:

   Couldn't delete all the items.

   Error attempting to delete the requested items. Items have been removed from
   the query result list but not necessarily from the database. Refresh the data
   to ensure the result is correct.

The following error is displayed in the SQL messages window:

   Msg SQL Server has run out of LOCKS. Re-run your command when there are fewer
   active users, or ask your System Administrator reconfigure SQL Server with
   more LOCKS.

   Msg The rollback transaction request has no corresponding BEGIN TRANSACTION.


CAUSE
=====

All the computers in the query window are locked during a delete. Each lock uses
32 bytes. For example, 10,000 locks uses 320,000 bytes, which are then
unavailable for caching the database.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, add more locks in SQL Server. If you must perform a
one-time delete of a large number of computers, you can increase the number of
locks specifically for the delete operation and then reduce the number of locks
later.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, and 1.1, and 1.2. This problem is not as severe under Systems
Management Server version 1.2.
