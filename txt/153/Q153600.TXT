TITLE   :Missing Extended Memory After Restarting from MS-DOS Mode
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:diskmem win95 kbDiskMemory

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you type "win" to restart Windows 95 from MS-DOS mode, your computer may
seem to have lost 2 MB of extended memory.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you are using QEMM version 7.50 with OEM Service
Release 2 (OSR2).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use any one of the following methods:

1. Type "exit" instead of "win" to return to Windows 95 from MS-DOS mode.

2. Upgrade to QEMM version 8.0 or later.

3. After you restart Windows 95 by typing "win," shut down and restart the
   computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In OSR2, loading Win.com automatically starts SmartDrive. This is not normally a
problem because SmartDrive is released by Win.com in the transition from real
mode to protected mode. QEMM, however, allocates specific extended memory that
Windows 95 cannot reclaim when Win.com unloads SmartDrive. The memory that
cannot be reclaimed is the memory used by SmartDrive.
