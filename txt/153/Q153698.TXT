TITLE   :Microsoft Word Grid Outline May Cause Slow Printer Spooling
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

When you print a Microsoft Word document at 600dpi in either PostScript or PCL,
and it contains tables, it will create a very large spool file. Microsoft Word
document tables that have a grid border with a line type of three-quarter point
dots or dashes will cause the spool file to contain an image; consequently, the
spool file is very large and takes a long time to generate.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
