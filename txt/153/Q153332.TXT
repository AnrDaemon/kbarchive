TITLE   :ECHO Command in a Batch File Does Not Echo /Q
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the ECHO command is used within a batch file, the following problem occurs.
In this example, test.bat is a batch file that contains the following line:

   echo %1

If you run:

   TEST.BAT /AAA/Q/BBB

what is displayed is:

    /aaabbb

In other words, /Q is stripped from the string. The problem occurs even when the
argument for the batch file is within quotation marks.

CAUSE
=====

/Q is misinterpreted as "quiet mode" option.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
