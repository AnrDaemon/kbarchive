TITLE   :WinNT Systems Running RAS May Exhaust Available DHCP Leases
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A RAS service configured to use dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) to
allocate IP addresses for dial-up clients may acquire more IP address leases
than needed, thereby depleting available addresses.

The leased addresses are indicated by a telephone icon in the Active Leases
window of DHCP Manager.

This problem can occur when portable computer users on the network who have
installed RAS and configured it for dialing out and receiving calls start their
systems on and off the network.

CAUSE
=====

During initialization, the RAS service acquires new leases because it fails to
read information regarding previously acquired leases. The previously leased
addresses, now orphaned, will only be returned to the pool of available
addresses when their leases expire.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
