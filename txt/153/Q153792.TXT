TITLE   :BUG: MESSAGEBOX() Function Displays Incorrect Icon
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The MESSAGEBOX() function does not display a question mark icon when the second
paramenter, nDialogType, is 32. When the nDialogType parameter is 32, the
function displays the information icon.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Help file states that passing 32 to the MESSAGEBOX() function produces a
question mark icon within the MESSAGEBOX() dialog. However, the MESSAGEBOX()
function in Visual FoxPro for the Macintosh displays an information icon
instead.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Enter the following commands in the Command window:

      ? MESSAGEBOX("Information Icon",64)
      ? MESSAGEBOX("Question Mark",32)

When the nDialogType parameter equals 64, the information icon correctly appears.
Passing 32 as the nDialogType parameter, however, does not produce a question
mark icon.
