TITLE   :Deinstal.bat Does Not Always Set Setup Phase to Deinstal
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup smssetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


Deinstal.bat does not always set SetupPhase to "deinstal" in the Sms.ini.

The deinstal command window shows:

   Running cli_nt  /r
   The name is not recognized as a command
   Phase 1 of client deinstal is complete

The Sms.ini file shows that SetupPhase is still "installed" instead of being
changed to "deinstal."

MORE INFORMATION
================

This seems to occur only when you map a drive (for example, F) to
\\servername\sms_shr, then type "f:\deinstal" (without the quotation marks). The
problem does not occur if you first switch to the drive and run "deinstal".


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
