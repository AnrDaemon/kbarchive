When you use the Estimators in the Microsoft Reader's Digest Complete
Do-It-Yourself Guide, you are only able to enter English measurements, such as
inches or feet. Metric measurements, such as centimeters or meters, cannot be
entered. This is true regardless of the measurement system you select in the
Regional Settings Control Panel.

MORE INFORMATION

You can use English to Metric converter in the Estimators to convert any metric
measurements to English measurements.
