TITLE   :WFW TCPIP32b Client Does Not Hold Lease if DHCP Not Available
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER::3.11,3.11a,3.11b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, versions 3.11, 3.11a, 3.11b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A computer running Windows For Workgroups (WFWG) with TCPIP32 DHCP client
installed and that is also running the Shiva Remote client that is supplied with
Microsoft Exchange, is unable to access TCP/IP resources after being restarted.
Carrying out an ipconfig command from an MS-DOS command prompt shows an IP
address of 0.0.0.0. The client previously had a valid DHCP lease before
restarting.

CAUSE
=====

The client does not retain the previous lease after being restarted. Instead, it
issues a new discover <request packet?> each time it is restarted. The
DHCP server was temporarily unavailable when the WFWG client restarted and was
unable to lease a new address.

There are 2 files that may have been replaced as a hotfix, Vdhcp.386 and
Vnbt.386. The file dates would be from 1996. These files are necessary for the
Shiva remote client to accept a TCP/IP address from a PPP server. However, these
files are the cause of the client not retaining a valid lease after restart.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups TCPIP32
version 3.11b. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
