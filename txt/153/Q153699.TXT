SUMMARY
=======

When getting properties on the IMC, Administrator reports the following three
errors:

   The character set files could not be found. Current settings will be shown.

   The MIME character set that is currently configured is shown, but is no
   longer available. Check the character sets to ensure that they have been
   installed correctly.

   The non-MIME character set that is currently configured is shown, but is no
   longer available. Check the character sets to ensure that they have been
   installed correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Verify that a TRN file is available for the MIME and non-MIME character set
   (that is, ANSI.TRN and ISO88591.TRN by default).

2. Verify the share point for the \Exchsrvr\Connect directory. If the share is
   missing, re-create it as connect$ share, give the Service Account and
   Administrators' group full permissions, and give Everyone read permissions.
