TITLE   :Microsoft Phone Does Not Translate Letters to Numbers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Phone, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Phone may incorrectly dial a phone number that contains letters.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Phone does not translate letters into corresponding DTMF tones if the
"Use country code and area code" check box in the Dialing Options dialog box is
not selected.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the Dialing Options dialog box, click the "Use country code and area code"
check box to select it. This setting causes Microsoft Phone to translate letters
into the corresponding DTMF tones needed to place a call. For example, the phone
number 425-936-ABCD would be translated to 425-936-2223.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the "Use country code and area code" check box is not selected, Microsoft
Phone interprets letters in a phone number literally. For example, the phone
number 425-555-ABCD would be dialed as 425-555-ABCD, which would result in the
call not being completed because there are no tones assigned to the letters
"ABCD."
