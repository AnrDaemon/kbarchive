TITLE   :XCON: MTA Terminates Unexpectedly in Large Nested DL Expansion
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) version 5.0 may terminate
unexpectedly when performing distribution list (DL) expansion on a large, nested
DL. An event similar to the following may be logged in the application event
log:

   Event ID:9405
   Source:MSExchangeMTA
   Type:Error
   Category:Field Engineering
   Description:
   An unexpected error has occurred which may cause the MTA to terminate. Error:
   Access violation (0xc0000005) at Address 0x775e5a50 reading from 0xc. [BASE
   DISP:FANOUT 15] (16)

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem may occur if, for example, there are 26 DLs nested beneath a single
DL where the number of members to any one of the nested DLs may range from 0 to
600 or more. When a message is sent to the DL that contains the 26 nested DLs,
the MTA may terminate unexpectedly with the 9405 event ID.

The following event may occur and the MTA may stop before logging a 9405 event:

   message NMI2171: Internal Processing Error, severity 14

   (DB Server DISP:FANOUT(12) Proc 26) 04-18-97 02:13:47pm
   Error reading attribute
   Called from MTA Proc 223
   Database error code     ODXOINIU - Object does not exist
   Object at fault         06000000
   Attribute identifier    28
   Value number            44
   Referenced object       00000000     (00000000 => N/A)
   Referenced object error 0

The DISP:FANOUT indicates a problem expanding an object, in this case, a large
distribution list that contains a number of other distribution lists. The
presence of the 06000000 as the Object at Fault is another indication of this
particular issue.

STATUS

version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 5.0
