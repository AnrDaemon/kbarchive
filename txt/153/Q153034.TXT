SYMPTOMS
========

Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.

When you use the Microsoft Access for Windows 95 Upsizing Tools to upsize your
Microsoft Access database to Microsoft SQL Server, your selected tables are not
exported to Microsoft SQL Server. When you view the report created by the
Upsizing Tools, you may receive the following error message:

   TABLE: <Table Name> was skipped, or export failed.

CAUSE
=====

In the properties of your ODBC Data Source you have the "Convert OEM to ANSI
Characters" check box checked, and you have selected a translator.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can use the following steps to work around this behavior:

16 bit ODBC
-----------

1. In Control Panel, click the ODBC icon. Find your ODBC Data Source and click
   Setup.

2. Click the Select button in the Translation section and click to select <No
   Translator>. Then click to clear the "Convert OEM to ANSI Characters
   Option.

32 bit ODBC
-----------

1. In Control Panel, clich the 32bit ODBC icon. Find your ODBC Data Source and
   click Configure.

2. Click Next three times. You should see the question: "Do you want to perform
   character set translation?"

3. Check the "Do not perform character translation" option.
