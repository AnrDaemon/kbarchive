For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q194057.

SYMPTOMS
========

In FrontPage Explorer, when you open an internal Web after a proxy server has
been defined, the following error message may appear:

   The server may not have the FrontPage Server Extensions installed, or the
   server may be misconfigured, or you may have specified an invalid proxy
   server, or the Web you are accessing may have been deleted (HTTP error 404)

CAUSE
=====

The ability to access internal host names is unavailable in FrontPage Explorer
when a proxy server is designated, unless one of the following conditions is
true:

 - The internal host names are specified in the "List of Hosts without Proxy"
   (on the Tools menu, click Proxies).

   -or-

 - The IP address of the Web Server is specified in the Open Web dialog box.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, follow these steps:

1. Open FrontPage Explorer.

2. On the Tools menu, click Proxies.

3. Under "List of Hosts without Proxy," list all internal host names that you
   want to be accessed inside the proxy.

NOTE: When you specify multiple host names to be used without a proxy, use commas
to separate the names as in the following example:

hostname1,hostname2

MORE INFORMATION
================

Wild card characters (* or ?) can not be used to specify host IP addresses in
the "List of Hosts Without Proxy" list.
