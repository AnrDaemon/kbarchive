TITLE   :SMS: Inventory of NetWare Servers Is Delayed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbInventory kbMaintMan smsinv smsmaintman

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


The following tasks performed by the Maintenance Manager service may be delayed:

 - RAW inventory files remain on logon servers awaiting collection

 - Updated Resync.cfg file not posted to logon servers

 - Site property changes involving clients are not reflected in Domain.ini on
   the logon servers

 - A site component addition or removal involving logon server components does
   not reach the logon servers

 - NetWare logon server performance may appear to be degraded by excessive disk
   activity. When you check with the Monitor utility on a NetWare server, you
   may see sporadic processor utilization and hard disk activity.

CAUSE
=====

The Systems Management Server Maintenance Manager service performs inventory on
the NetWare server every 24 hours. This includes software inventory, if defined.
On NetWare servers with large volumes, this can take a considerable amount of
time. Combined with the fact that a number of NetWare logon server may be
defined, the Maintenance Manager service can take an extended period to perform
the software inventory.

Inventory is initially taken for NetWare servers during the first cycle of
Maintenance Manager after startup. Inventory is again taken 24 hours after the
last inventory of a NetWare server is taken. There is no way to alter the
24-hour inventory period in Systems Management Server 1.0 or 1.1.

WORKAROUND
==========

Disable software inventory for each package for which inventory is defined on
the site server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management
Server version 1.2.
