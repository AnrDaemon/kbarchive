TITLE   :XCLN: Err Msg: MAPI Was Unable to Load Emsmdb.dll
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message appears:

   The set of folders could not be opened. An unexpected error has occurred.
   MAPI was unable to load the information service Emsmdb.dll. Be sure the
   service is correctly installed and configured.

CAUSE
=====

The error message references Emsmdb.dll, but the correct DLL, Emsmdb32.dll, does
reside in the <Winroot>\System directory. The wrong file is being
referenced because the Wsock32.dll is not the right version; Wsock32.dll
therefore references Emsmdb.dll instead of Emsmdb32.dll.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

 - Replace Wsock32.dll with the Windows 95 version.
