TITLE   :BUG: Access Driver DBQ=, DefaultDir= Incorrect with Large mdb
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbBug kbISS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 3.4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

If the path to an mdb file is over 85 bytes, then after a SQLDriverConnect call,
the ends of the DBQ= and DefaultDir= strings in the szConnStrOut parameter will
be overwritten.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have an mdb file in a deeply nested directory whose path exceeds 85
bytes, such as the following:

   c:\nested01\nested02\nested03\nested04\nested05\nested06\nested07\nested
   08\nested09\general.mdb

and if you create a data source on it, then, after a SQLDriverConnect using that
data source, the szConnStrOut variable will have two problems:

1. The end of the DBQ= string will be overlaid with the literal DBQ.

2. The end of the DefaultDir= string will be overlaid with the literal
   DefaultDir

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the ODBC Access 3.40.2505
driver. Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, move the mdb file to a directory that has a shorter
path name.
