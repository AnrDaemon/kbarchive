TITLE   :SMS PCM: "General File Transfer Error" Distributing Netscape
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPCM smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you distribute Netscape for installation at a workstation using a "Run
Command on a Workstation" package, the following error message appears:

   General File Transfer Error

CAUSE
=====

The Setup process loses connection to the distribution server during file
transfer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, use the "-SMS" (without quotation marks) parameter with
Setup.exe on the command line of a Systems Management Server package. This
forces an active connection between the client to the distribution server and
allows Setup.exe to run on remote computers.
