SUMMARY
=======

Remote OLE Automation involves cross-machine calls across a network, which can
really slow things down, so it is important to keep a few things in mind while
making such remote calls. This article lists the ways in which you could
optimize the performance of your remote calls.

MORE INFORMATION
================

First, always use Early Binding. This reduces the number of calls between
objects by about 50%. This can make a big performance difference when remoting
objects (especially over RAS). The only time you should use late binding is if
you do not know ahead of time what the object is that you will be connecting
to.

Second, when calling methods on objects, create a method that accepts 'n' number
of parameters than exposing 'n' properties on the object, setting each, and then
calling the method. This is faster because the OLE call is the more expensive
part in terms of execution time. Passing relatively large amounts of data within
the call works well. The one limitation to keep in mind while doing this is that
if you are using a 16-bit object, you can't pass more than 64k of data at one
time.
