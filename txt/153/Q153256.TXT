SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to build the Wrui3270.exe sample application from the SNA SDK with
Microsoft Visual C++ version 4.0, the build would fail with the following
compiler output:

   

   LINK : warning LNK4049: locally defined symbol _exit imported
   rui3270.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __imp__printf
   wrui3270.exe : fatal error LNK1120: 1 unresolved externals
   NMAKE : fatal error U1077: 'link' : return code '0x19'
   Stop.
   Error executing NMAKE.
   n3271.exe - 3 error(s), 1 warning(s)

CAUSE
=====

The make file was compiling with options from one C Runtime library and linking
with another, leading to the unresolved externals.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server 2.0, 2.1,
2.11, and 2.11.sp1. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA
Server 2.11 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack,
