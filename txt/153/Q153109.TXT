TITLE   :Error Installing WFW Client from DEC OEM NT Server 3.51 CD
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You want to install the Windows for Workgroups client from a network boot disk.
You run the Network Client Administration to make a network installation startup
disk. When you try to run the installation from the Clients\WFW\Netsetup
directory on the Windows NT Server 3.51 compact disc, the following error
appears:

   Path Not Found

This occurs when you are using the origianl equipment manufacturer(OEM) version
of the Windows NT Server 3.51 compact disc from Digital Equipment Corporation
(DEC).

CAUSE
=====

The Autoexec.bat file created on the network installation disk contains the
following entries:

   net use z: \\NTSERVERNAME\Clients
   echo Running Setup...
   z:\wfw\netsetup\setup.exe /#

The \Wfw\Netsetup directory located under the share "Clients" is valid on a
Microsoft Windows NT Server 3.51 compact disc that comes directly from
Microsoft, but the directory does not exist on the OEM version compact disc from
DEC.


WORKAROUND
==========

Replace the OEM version of the Windows NT Server V3.51 compact disc on your
network server with the Microsoft compact disc, which contains the Windows for
Workgroups clients directory.
