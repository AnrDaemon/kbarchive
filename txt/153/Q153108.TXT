TITLE   :Errors in Appman.log After Running NADRESET
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPCM smsgeneral smsappman smspcm kbArtTypeINF kbSMSAppMan

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you detach a child site from a parent site and run Nadreset.exe,
Appman.log will report errors similar to the following:

   ERR ##> Error getting package <package id> from source (SQL).

If SQL tracing is turned on the error appears after a select statement to the
Packages table querying the package ID. A query to the packages table shows that
the package no longer exists in the database.

CAUSE
=====

Applications Manager looks in the registry in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree at
the following subkey:

   \Software\SMS\Components\SMS_DESPOOLER\Master Packages

for the list of packages to search for in the database. Nadreset.exe does not
delete the package keys from the registry although it does remove them from the
database.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARINING: Using Registry Editor can cause serious, system-wide problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft cannot guarantee
that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
this tool at your own risk.

Deleting the package ID keys will alleviate the errors in the APPMAN.LOG.

1. Run the Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

2. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree go the following subkey:

   \Software\SMS\Components\SMS_DESPOOLER\Master Packages.

3. Delete the package ID keys.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2.
