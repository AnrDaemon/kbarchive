======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Selecting multiple controls in the ResourceView and changing their language will
cause Visual C++ to crash.

RESOLUTION
==========

Select the controls individually and change the language option one at a time.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++ .NET.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a project called Test using the MFC(EXE) AppWizard. In Step 1 of the
   MFC(EXE) AppWizard, select Multiple Documents and then click Finish.

2. Click the ResourceView tab.

3. Expand the Test Resources folder and then expand the Menu folder.

4. Select IDR_MAINFRAME and IDR_TESTTYPE, then right-click and select Properties
   from the pop-up menu.

5. In the Multiple Selection Properties window, change the language using the
   Language combo box. For example, if it is currently set to English (U.S.),
   change it to English (U.K.). Visual C++ may crash when you try to change the
   language.

6. Press ENTER or select the Condition edit window, and Visual C++ will crash.

Because of this crash, Visual C++ isn't removed from memory so you will have to
end the Msdev.exe process using Task Manager or you will get error messages when
you try to open the Test workspace in another instance of Visual C++.
