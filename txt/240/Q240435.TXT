TARGET DEVICE

Palm-size PCs running Windows CE version 2.11

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

Palm-size PC devices running Windows CE version 2.11 hang or reset during the
self-registration process of ActiveX controls when they are installed within an
Application Installation CAB file. This behavior occurs because the
device-install program WCELoad.exe was not invoking CoInitializeEx before the
self-registration process.

UPDATE PACKAGE DESCRIPTION

This package silently installs the fixed WCELoad.exe file to a connected
Palm-size PC device. If the connected device is not a color Palm-size PC, or the
device already has the fixed file, then the package exits immediately with a
successful return code.

USAGE

Your desktop setup program needs to perform the following before invoking
CEAppMgr to install the CAB files:

1. Prompt the user to connect the device.

2. Run the WCELupd.exe file and wait for it to complete.

3. Examine the return code and handle it appropriately. In most cases, the only
   error return code that needs to be handled is the "device disconnected"
   return code 1.

FILES TO REDISTRIBUTE

The following three files comprise this update package, and must reside in the
same directory:

   WCELupd.exe
   WCE10003.bin
   WCE4000.bin

RETURN CODES

Following are the possible return codes from WCELupd.exe:

   0 - Success
   1 - Device disconnected
   2 - Unsupported color Palm-size PC processor
   3 - ActiveSync RAPI error
   4 - Windows CE Services or ActiveSync not installed
   5 - General error
