PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:kbenv win95 win98 win98se

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a Pause statement in a logon script for troubleshooting, the
process is not stopped and the logon script window closes.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if a script does not complete correctly. Some script
errors cause the logon script to end prematurely. If the script ends before
reaching the Pause statement, the script is not processed and the window is
closed. This prevents you from seeing any error messages that are generated.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, change the program properties for the logon script
processor (Lmscript.exe):

1. Right-click the Lmscript.pif file. The Lmscript.pif file is located in the
   <Windir>\System folder, where <Windir> is the name of your
   Windows folder.

2. Click Properties, and then click Program.

3. Click to clear the "Close On Exit" check box, and then click OK.

The logon script window should now remain open after the logon script ends.
