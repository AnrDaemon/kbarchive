TITLE   :Overflow from NtGdiAddFontResourceW Returning Uninitialized Pool
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbProgramming kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the NtGdiAddFontResourceW() function call is started on your computer
running Windows NT 4.0, the calling process may stop responding (hang) and an
overflow error message may be returned to the user.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the string length needs to be limited to a smaller
value.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT Server or Workstation 4.0
------------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or the
individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:

The length of pwszFile has been changed to accommodate this requirement and to
enable the processing of this routine without overflow.

Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
----------------------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition.

This problem was first corrected in Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6 and
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the NtGdiAddFontResourceW() function is started, a WCHAR pointer is passed
from usermode. The routine then allocates a buffer and forwards the process to
bCheckAndCapThePath(). The bCheckAndCapThePath() function calls cCapString() to
copy and uppercase the string, and cCapString() uses RtlUpcaseUnicodeString() to
copy and uppercase the strings if it has the correct word buffer size. If the
string length is greater than 32,767 bytes, the routine cannot start all of the
output buffer and some of the pool may be returned as 'not started' and cause an
overflow.
