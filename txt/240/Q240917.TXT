The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You may want to change the location of the directories that are used by the
Windows NT version 4.0 Option Pack SMTP mail service. This article provides a
procedure to make that change.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Make sure that you stop the SMTP service before you perform this procedure. To
change the location of the directories, duplicate the mail service structure on
the drive or location that you want to use, and then modify the metabase by
running the following command line entries:

 - adsutil.vbs set smtpsvc/1/dropdirectory "<drive
   letter>:\inetpub\mailroot\drop"

 - adsutil.vbs set smtpsvc/1badmaildirectory "<drive
   letter>:\inetpub\mailroot\badmail"

 - adsutil.vbs set pickupdirectory "<drive
   letter>:\inetpub\mailroot\pickup"

 - adsutil.vbs set queuedirectory "<drive letter>:\inetpub\mailroot\queue"

After you perform this procedure, the existing directories are moved to a new
location. Messages that are queued are processed when you restart the SMTP
service.
