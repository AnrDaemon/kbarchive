SUMMARY
=======

If you disable antivirus software programs from scanning or filtering files on
your computer, you must also disable the filter drivers. Many issues with file
transfering and printing can be resolved by disabling the active filters for
antivirus programs. However, simply stopping the services associated with the
software is not enough. You must also manually stop the device drivers for those
filters. To do this for Windows NT:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   Devices.

2. Select the drivers in the Device list, and then click Stop.

NOTE: The actual Symantec filter driver is called "symevent.sys".

To do this for Windows 2000:

1. Right click My Computer and click Properties.

2. Click the Hardware tab and click the Device Manager button.

3. Click the View menu and click "Show Hidden Devices".

4. Expand "Non-Plug and Play Drivers" to find the Antivirus drivers.

5. Right click on the correct driver and click Disable.
