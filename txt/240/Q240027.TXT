SYMPTOMS
========

In the Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 HTML Administration pages, an
incorrect format name is listed for the W3C Extended Log File Format and the
Microsoft IIS Log File Format.

The W3C Extended Log File Format and Microsoft IIS Log File Format are both
listed with the NCSA format name.

The NCSA format has an "nc" prefix, for example, ncyymmdd.log. The W3C format
name should have an "ex" prefix, as in exyymmdd.log, and the Microsoft IIS
format should have an "in" prefix, as in inyymmdd.log.

However, all the log files are created with the correct name when written.

Additional query words: iis
