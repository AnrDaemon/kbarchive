----------------------------------------------------------------------

To distinguish between Exchange Server Standard Edition (limited information
store) and Exchange Server Enterprise Edition (unlimited information store),
check the Windows NT Server Event Viewer application log upon startup.

The following event is logged in the application log when the information store
starts on a computer running the Standard Edition:

Event ID  1216<BR/>

Type:     Information<BR/>
Category: General<BR/>
Description: Information store with limited storage capacity enabled.

The following event is logged in the application log when the information store
starts on a computer running the Enterprise Edition:

Event Id:  1217<BR/>
Source:    MSExchangeIS<BR/>
Type:      Information<BR/>
Category:  General<BR/>
Description: "Information store with unlimited capacity started"<BR/>

How to Change the Type Attribute
--------------------------------

The Type attribute can only be changed by running Setup.exe from an Enterprise
Edition CD (SrvRmax.exe if using Select CDs), and clicking Reinstall. This
changes the Type attribute within the Dir.edb file, giving you an unlimited
store.

NOTE: You need to reapply the last Exchange Server service pack that had been
applied to the server before the reinstallation, after the reinstallation is
finished.
