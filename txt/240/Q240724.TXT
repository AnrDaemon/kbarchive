Contacts, or Team Tasks), any of the following error messages may appear in the
Summary view for the program:

   created.

 - The Microsoft Exchange Server services are currently unavailable (down).

 - The physical public folder locations have been deleted from the public
   folders on the Exchange server.

 - The currently logged-on user does not have a valid mailbox on the server
   being connected to, or does not have permissions on the public folder in
   which the Team Folder Applications are stored.

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify the following items and correct as necessary:

 - Make sure Outlook 2000 is installed and properly configured.

 - Configure Outlook 2000 with a mail profile of a user with permissions to the
   Team Folder Applications for the Team Workspace in question.

 - Verify that the Exchange Server services are started and working properly.

 - Verify that the public folder hierarchy in which the Team Folders
   Applications are installed exists, and has not been renamed or deleted.

 - Check to make sure that the mail profile in use is connecting to the Exchange
   server on which the Team Folders Applications exist.
