TITLE   :Shadow Folders Are Not Updated When You Use Mapped Drives
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER::5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe500 kbSSafe600 kbDSupport kbGrpDSSSafe

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you create a shadow folder in Visual SourceSafe (VSS), the following error
message occurs when you check in a file:

   Invalid dos path to the mapped directory.

The shadow folder is not updated.

CAUSE
=====

Visual SourceSafe attempts to update the shadow folder by referencing it from
the SourceSafe client computer. Therefore, all clients must have mapped drives
to the shadow folder that are identical.

NOTE: Visual SourceSafe does not issue a warning that all clients must also
create a mapped drive in order for this feature to work.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, shadow directly by using the Universal Naming
Convention (for example, \\machinename\share). Alternatively, a mapped drive
must be created for all individual clients that point to the shadow directory
path.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce This Behavior
--------------------------------

1. Map a drive to the location where you intend to create a shadow folder.

2. Open the Visual SourceSafe Administrator, click Tools, click Options, click
   the Shadow Folder tab, and then create a shadow folder to the mapped drive.

3. Open SourceSafe Explorer on a client computer that does not have a mapped
   drive.

4. The error occurs when you attempt to check in a file to the project that
   shadows to the mapped drive.

Additional query words: shadowing UNC
