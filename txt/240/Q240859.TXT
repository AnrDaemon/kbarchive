TITLE   :XADM: Admin.exe Stops Responding when Connected over Internet
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to an Exchange Server computer over the Internet, the Exchange
Server Administrator program (Admin.exe) stops responding (hangs). In Task
Manager, the Administrator program is listed as "Not responding."

MORE INFORMATION
================

Troubleshooting Steps:
----------------------

1. Ping the Exchange Server computer by name to verify successful name
   resolution. If necessary create a HOSTS file for troubleshooting purposes.

2. Statically map the ports for the information store, directory service, and
   system attendant on the Exchange Server computer.

   Connections Through a Firewall

3. Configure any firewall or router involved to allow TCP connections to be made
   to the ports mapped for the information store, directory, and system
   attendant, as well as to port 135. Exchange Server uses a well-known static
   port (port 135) to listen for Administrator connections to the remote
   procedure call (RPC) Endpoint Mapper Service. However, after the
   Administrator program connects to this socket, Exchange Server then
   re-assigns the program three random ports to use when communicating with the
   information store, directory, and the system attendant. This makes it
   impossible to allow these through the firewall without forcing them to be
   statically assigned.
