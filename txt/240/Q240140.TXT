SYMPTOMS
========

After you move multiple users to a new account domain, some of the users may not
be able to view the list of available domains when they attempt to log on to the
new assigned domain.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this issue, delete the registry keys that cache the outdated domain
list:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the Dcache value in the following key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

3. Click the Dcache value, press DELETE, and then click Yes.

4. Click the DcacheUpdate value, press DELETE, and then click Yes.

5. Quit Registry Editor.

6. Restart the computer to rebuild the cached domain list with the new assigned
   domain.
