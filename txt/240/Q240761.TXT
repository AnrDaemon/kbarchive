PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

On the Security tab of the SNA Server subdomain, an LUA check box exists to
allow user-validated security for LUA applications. However, this does not apply
to TN3270 LUA LUs. Even though TN3270 LUA LUs can be assigned to users in SNA
Server Manager, no user validation will occur.

MORE INFORMATION
================

TN3270 uses Telnet to communicate between the client and the server by
encapsulating 3270 data in Telnet sessions to the TN3270 Service. Telnet is a
TCP/IP protocol that uses IP addressing to determine the source and destination
of packets. No user credentials are passed to the TN3270 Service for validation.
