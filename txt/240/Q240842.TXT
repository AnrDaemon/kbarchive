SUMMARY
=======

Java servlets are server side web server extensions. Java servlets are designed
as a Java replacement for CGI.

Servlets can be used and migrated between web servers because they rely on the
servlet API rather than the server itself.

To use servlets on a web server the web server must have a Virtual Machine that
can support the language of the servlet (in this case Java), and the server must
also support the Java Servlet API.

To implement Java Servlets on IIS, you need an engine to host them.

The following list are some possible:

 - IBM WebSphere Application Server

 - Jrun from Macromedia

 - ServletExecTM 2.1
