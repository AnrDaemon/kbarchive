A Standard EXE or UserControl form contains a second UserControl. The second
UserControl contains a text box and a data control. You close all the forms and
then open the second UserControl. When you attempt to change the DataSource
property of the text box in the property window, the UserControl immediately
closes or an application error occurs that causes Visual Basic to stop
responding.
