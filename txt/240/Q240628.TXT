TITLE   :SMS: Install May Not Assign Client to a Site
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the base client components in Systems Management Server, the
client may not be assigned to a site and optional components my not be
installed.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the client has an IP address of 0.0.0.0 in the Windows
NT Network Table.

For example, you can experience this issue if a client uses a modem to connect
using Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) or has PPP installed and selected as the
first protocol in the binding order.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, use one of the following methods:

1. Remove the hardware or software that created the 0.0.0.0 address.

2. Change the network binding order to make the protocol that registers a valid
   address the first bound protocol.

3. Add 0.0.0.0 to the Systems Management Server site boundaries so the client
   can be assigned.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
