KEYWORDS:kbDAO350 kbGrpDSVBDB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to open a DBase IV file using DAO, and the file has a name
greater then eight characters the following error message appears:

   The Microsoft Jet database engine could not find the object 'long file name'.
   Make sure the object exists and that you spell its name and the path name
   correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The cause of the problem is the fact that the file name is greater than eight
characters.

RESOLUTION
==========

The workaround is to rename the file using eight characters or less.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Standard EXE project in Visual Basic.

2. Add a Reference to "Microsoft DAO 3.51 Object Library".

3. Place a command button on the form and add the following code:

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
   Dim db As Database
   Dim rs As Recordset

   Set db = OpenDatabase("d:\", False, False, "dbase IV;")

   ' the following line will return error 
   Set rs = db.OpenRecordset("statedata")

   Do While Not rs.EOF
   Debug.Print rs.Fields(0).Value
   rs.MoveNext
   Loop

   End Sub

4. Rename the dBase file to eight characters or less, and earlier code runs
   without error.
