The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you have multiple Microsoft Visual SourceSafe (VSS) databases, and are using
the VSS command line, you can use the SSDIR environment variable to point to the
required database.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Each VSS database has its own Srcsafe.ini file. The VSS command line (SS.exe)
needs to locate a Srcsafe.ini file in order to determine which database it uses.
In most cases Ss.exe is in the VSS\Win32 directory and by default will find a
Srcsafe.ini file in the VSS directory. If you want Ss.exe to use a different
Srcsafe.ini, use the following command:

SET SSDIR=<path to srcsafe.ini>\ 

For example:

SET SSDIR=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\VSS

or

SET SSDIR=\\vss_server\vss_share

NOTE: There must not be spaces around the "=" character. Also note that if you
use the SET SSDIR command in a Command Prompt (DOS) window, the SSDIR setting is
not maintained after the window is closed.
