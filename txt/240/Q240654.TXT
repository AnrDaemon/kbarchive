SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to change passwords on a Web server that
is running on a port other than 80.

Introduction
------------

Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0 and Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0
include Administration Web pages that allow users to change passwords only when
a Web server is running on the IIS default port of 80. This article describes
how to modify these pages to work on other ports.

By default, the IIS installation creates a folder in the following location:

   %SYSTEMROOT%\system32\inetsrv\iisadmpwd

The following files are then copied to that folder:

   Achg.htr
   Aexp.htr
   Aexp2.htr
   Aexp2b.htr
   Aexp3.htr
   Aexp4.htr
   Aexp4b.htr
   Anot.htr
   Anot3.htr

Configure the Pages for Different Ports
---------------------------------------

1. Open each of the pages and search the text for the following string:

    <%iis.SERVER_NAME%>

2. For each occurrence of this text, if the URL begins with
   "http://<%iis.SERVER_NAME%>" change it to read
   "http://<%iis.SERVER_NAME%>:<PORT1>," where <PORT1> is the
   port that the Web site is listening on.

3. Likewise, change each URL that begins with
   "https://<%iis.SERVER_NAME%>" to read
   "https://<%iis.SERVER_NAME%>:<PORT2>," where <PORT2> is the
   Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) port that the Web site is listening on.

Troubleshooting
---------------

You may receive the following error message when you try to modify a password:

   The parameter is incorrect.
