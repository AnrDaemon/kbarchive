SYMPTOMS
========

When you use an Hewlett-Packard (HP) 10/100TX PCI ethernet adapter in
conjunction with the Hptxnt.sys driver on your Hewlett-Packard NetServer-based
computer running Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 3, you may receive a STOP
error message similar to the message listed below on a blue screen:

   STOP 0x0000000A (0x24100104, 0x00000002, 0x00000000, 0xf236a279)
   IRQ_NOTLESS_OR_EQUAL

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because there is a conflict between the updated drivers
included with Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 and the Network Driver Interface
Specification (NDIS) network adapter driver supplied by HP.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this issue, install the latest Ndis.sys and Hptxnt.sys drivers from
