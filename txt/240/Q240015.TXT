TITLE   :FIX: getline Template Function Reads Extra Character
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtemplate kbLangCPP kbSTL kbVC kbVC600 kbVC600bug kbNoUpdate

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Standard C++ Library, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Standard C++ Library template getline function reads an extra character
after encountering the delimiter. Please refer to the sample program in the More
Information section for details.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the getline member function, which can be found in the following system
header file string, as follows:

   	else if (_Tr::eq((_E)_C, _D))
                   {_Chg = true;
                 //  _I.rdbuf()->snextc(); /* Remove this line and add the line below.*/ 
   		  _I.rdbuf()->sbumpc();
                   break; }

NOTE: Because the resolution involves modifying a system header file, extreme
care should be taken to ensure that nothing else is changed in the header file.
Microsoft is not responsible for any problems resulting from unwanted changes to
the system header files.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++ .NET.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample program demonstrates the bug:

   //test.cpp
   //Compiler options : /GX
   #include <string>
   #include <iostream>
   int main () {
   	std::string s,s2;
   	std::getline(std::cin,s);
   	std::getline(std::cin,s2);
   	std::cout << s <<'\t'<< s2 << std::endl;
   	return 0;
   }

   Actual Results:
   Hello<Enter Key>
   World<Enter Key>
   <Enter Key>	
   Hello   World

   Expected Results:
   Hello<Enter Key>
   World<Enter Key>
   Hello   World
