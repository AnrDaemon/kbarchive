MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are an Internet service provider (ISP) and you want to reduce the
occurrence of this behavior, perform the following tasks:

 - Configure the proxy server to perform more update checks.
 - Configure the proxy server to perform more pre-fetching.
 - Reduce the Time to Live (TTL) setting for objects in the proxy server's
   cache.
 - Filter the cache, so that objects originating from the following address are
   not cached: http://fdl.msn.com/zone
