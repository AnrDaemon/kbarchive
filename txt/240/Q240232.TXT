SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Selection.Information(wdStartOfRangeColumnNumber) or
Selection.Information(wdStartOfRangeRowNumber) method to return the column or
row number from a Word table with merged cells, the information returned does
not take into account that a table contains merged cells. Thus the returned
information cannot be used to reference cells in rows that contain merged
cells.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use Visual Basic for Applications code to loop
through and mark Row, Column using the Tables(n).Columns.Count and
Tables(n).Rows.Count of each cell while keeping track of count manually.

==========
