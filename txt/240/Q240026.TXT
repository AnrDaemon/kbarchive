   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

If the "Run only allowed Windows applications" system policy is set to allow
only certain programs to be run in Windows 95, you may receive the following
error message when you attempt to open a document by double-clicking it in
Windows Explorer:

   Restrictions
   This operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this
   computer. Please contact your system administrator.

This error message may occur even if the program that opens the document is on
the list of allowed Windows applications.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs if the path to the program that opens the document (that is,
the program that is associated with the document's file type) contains spaces,
but is not enclosed in quotation marks.

This information is located in the registry, under a key of the following form:

   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\<file type>\shell\open\command

The path to the program that opens the file type is stored in the (Default) value
under this key.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:

Method 1
--------

Install Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01 Service Pack 1 (SP1) or later, and
choose to install the Windows Desktop Update component. To obtain Internet
Explorer, please visit the following Microsoft Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/ie

Method 2
--------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

On systems that are running an earlier version of Internet Explorer or not
running Internet Explorer at all, you may be able to work around this problem by
either surrounding the entire program path with quotation marks, or by altering
the program path to its equivalent short name (8.3) format. To do this:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedit.exe).

2. Locate the (Default) value under the following key

   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\<file type>\shell\open\command

where <file type> is the file type for the document you are trying to
open.

3. On the Edit menu, click Modify. Edit the value data to enclose the path to
   the program in quotation marks, and then click OK.

   For example, if the original value data is:

   C:\Program Files\APP1\Binary Files\APP1.EXE %1

Change the value to either:

   "C:\Program Files\APP1\Binary Files\APP1.EXE" %1 (notice the quotation
   marks)

   -or-

   C:\PROGRA~1\APP1\BINARY~1\APP1.EXE %1 (no quotation marks needed)

4. Quit Registry Editor.
