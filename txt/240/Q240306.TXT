KEYWORDS:kbHTMLHelp kbMSDN kbOSWin2000bug kbDSupport kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an MSDN Library CD-ROM begins to automatically run Setup on a computer
running Windows 2000, the following error may occur:

   Setup Initialization Error: Setup has encountered an error in the
   Registration Database.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when Setup is run by a member of the Users group on Windows
2000. Users do not have the necessary permissions to access the registry during
setup. MSDN Library Setup attempts to access the registry before it determines
that the user running Setup does not have administrator privileges.

RESOLUTION
==========

An administrator of the computer must log on and install the MSDN Library for
the user.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Administrative privileges are required to install the MSDN Library. The limited
access that a user has to the registry is by design.
