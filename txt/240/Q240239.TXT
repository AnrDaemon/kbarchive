======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Under some circumstances, developers might find it necessary to capture the path
to an executable file created with Visual FoxPro or the path to a file that is
running within an application's address space.

The path and file name of an executable file mapped into the address space of an
application can be returned with the GetModuleFileName function of the Windows
API.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The GetModuleHandle function is used to return a module handle for the specified
module if the file has been mapped into the address space of the calling
process.

The GetModuleFileName function retrieves the full path and filename for the file
containing the specified module. If the function succeeds, the return value is
the length, in characters, of the string copied to the buffer.

The following code illustrates this procedure.

1. Create a program file named GetName.PRG using the following code snippet:

   #DEFINE MAX_PATH         256

   parameter lcFileName

   *!* Initialize variables
   STORE SPACE(128) TO lpModuleName,lpFileName
   nSize        = MAX_PATH

   *!* Declare GetModuleHandle
   DECLARE INTEGER GetModuleHandle ;
      IN kernel32.DLL ;
      STRING @lpModuleName

   *!* Declare GetModuleFileName
   DECLARE INTEGER GetModuleFileName ;
      IN kernel32.DLL ;
      INTEGER hModule, ;
      STRING @lpFileName, ;
      INTEGER nSize
   *!* End of API declarations

   *!* Will look for the name of the file passed to lcFileName
   lpModuleName = lcFileName
   *!* Get a handle to the executable file
   testa=GetModuleHandle(@lpModuleName)
   *!* Get the path to the file
   testb=GetModuleFileName(testa,@lpFileName,nSize)
   *!* Remove the null terminator from the string
   lpFileName=LEFT(ALLTRIM(lpFileName),AT(CHR(0),lpFileName)-1)
   *!* Display the path in a messagebox.
   =MESSAGEBOX(lpFileName,64,'Path returned by GetModuleFileName')
   CLEAR DLLS

2. From the command line, type "DO GETNAME WITH ''" (without the quotation
   marks). Because no file is referenced, a messagebox appears and displays the
   path to the Visual FoxPro executable file.

3. From the command line, type "DO GETNAME WITH 'GDI32'" (without the quotation
   marks). Because GDI32.DLL is mapped into Visual FoxPro's address space, a
   messagebox appears and displays the path to the GDI32 dynamic link library.

4. From the command line, type "DO GETNAME WITH 'MYAPP'" (without the quotation
   marks). Because MYAPP.DLL is not mapped into Visual FoxPro's address space, a
   messagebox appears and displays the path to the Visual FoxPro executable
   file.

5. From the command line, type "DO GETNAME WITH 'KERNEL32'" (without the
   quotation marks). Because KERNEL32.DLL is mapped into Visual FoxPro's address
   space, a messagebox appears and displays the path to the KERNEL32 dynamic
   link library.
