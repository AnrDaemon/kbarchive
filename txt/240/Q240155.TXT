TITLE   :MMC Security Rights Do Not Work with More Than 64 Global Groups
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSecurity kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsmsAdmin kbsms200sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a user is a member of more than 64 global groups, that user may be unable to
gain access to the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Systems Management Server
(SMS) Administrator Console nodes using class permissions inherited from global
group membership.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because SMS Provider incorrectly enumerates the global
groups of which the user is a member and may not get the global group to which
the permissions are applied.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, grant explicit class rights to user accounts
instead of to global groups.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

Server site server.
