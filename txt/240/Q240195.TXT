TITLE   :"NET USER /TIMES" Command Does Not Work in Year 2000
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbYear2000 kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the year 2000, the /times switch does not work correctly with the net user
command. Any day and time range yields one of the following error messages:

   

 - An illegal day range has been supplied.
   More help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 3768.

 - An illegal time range has been supplied.
   More help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 3769.

CAUSE
=====

The time interval for the /times parameter is passed in local time. However, the
information about logon hours in the account database is stored in Universal
Time Coordinate (UTC) time format. Therefore, Net.exe must take the current date
into account for the daylight savings offset. The current algorithm does not
handle the year 2000 (or later) correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========
