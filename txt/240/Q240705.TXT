SUMMARY
=======

This article explains the server size limits for an MSN e-mail account.

MORE INFORMATION
================

10 megabytes (MB) of data can be stored on the MSN e-mail servers at any given
time for an individual MSN e-mail account. This does not, however, include data
that has been downloaded. Once an e-mail is downloaded, it is no longer stored
on the server and therefore clears up space on the server.

Additional query words: size limit msnmail kbmsn
