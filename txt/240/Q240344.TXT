TITLE   :SMS: Clients Do Not Report Advertisement Status
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you create a new advertisement and verify that it has run on a targeted
client, the advertisement status may not be updated with Received, Failures,
Programs Started, Program Errors, or Program Success. All values stay at zero,
regardless of the advertisements that are running.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if Milestone client status messages have been disabled
and clients are no longer generating the status messages required to update the
Advertisement Status fields, or if Milestone server component status messages
are not being reported into the SQL database.

RESOLUTION
==========

To turn client status messages back on, navigate to Site Database, Site
Code-Name, Site Settings, Component Configuration, and then Status Reporting
(properties). Verify that the "Report All Milestones" option is enabled for
Client Component Status Reporting.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, the Report All Milestones and Report Details On Failure options for
both Client Component Status Reporting and Server Component Status Reporting are
enabled.
