TITLE   :BUG: Schema Calls to DB2 on OS/400 V4R4 Cause 100% CPU Spin
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2, version 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When calls to retrieve schema information from DB2 on the OS/400 V4R4 are issued
with IDBSchemaRowset using the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2 or with
SQLTables using the Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2, 100 percent CPU utilization
occurs for that process.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do the following:

1. Obtain PTF SF99104 from IBM and apply it to the OS/400 V4R4.

2. Re-create the packages by checking the Replace existing package option in the
   CRTPKGW utility. For more information on creating packages using this
   utility, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   

   Q216810 Creating Packages for Use with ODBC Driver for DB2 and OLE DB
   Provider for DB2

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0
Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the problem continues after you apply the PTF and replace the existing
packages, it is recommended that you create a new collection and packages in
that collection, and use that collection and packages to issue the schema
calls.

Note: If the provider or driver uses an existing collection and packages, the
100-percent CPU spin and an Access Violation error in DB2Serv.exe may still
occur even after you apply the PTF.
