TITLE   :Roaming Profile Permissions Not Inherited on Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may notice that roaming profiles stored on the computer running Windows NT
Server do not inherit the parent folder's permissions or the source folder's
permissions from the local drive.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the process used in Userenv.dll to create the new
profile folder uses the CreateSecureDirectory() API to set the following
permissions:

   Administrators = FULL
   <%username%> = FULL
   System = FULL

When the user logs off, the CopyProfileDirectory() API is used, which does not
assign any permissions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, perform one of the following:

 - Create the profile folder in advance if it is necessary for the profile
   folder to inherit the parent's permissions.

-or-

 - Delete the profile folder on the server after the user has logged on but
   prior to the user logging off. The process used to create the folder when the
   user logs off (or update the profile on the server) does not set any
   permissions, effectively inheriting the parent's permissions.
