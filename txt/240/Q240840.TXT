   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

Events 60 and 703 may be logged and a negative response to an FMH-5 Attach
Message may be sent with a sense code of 084C0000 (transaction program not
available, no retry).

CAUSE
=====

An operator-started transaction program (TP) may have registry entries defining
it as an auto-started invokable TP running as a service and/or as an
application. This causes two or more entries in the SNA Server service table
with the same TP name. When an FMH-5 Attach message is sent to start a
conversation with the TP, the DMOD process should search the SNA Server service
table using the following priority order:

   1. Operator-started TPs currently running locally
   2. Operator-started TPs currently running on another computer
   3. Auto-started (invokable) TPs running locally
   4. Auto-started (invokable) TPs on another computer

SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 2 may route an incoming Attach message to an
auto-started TP even though an operator-started TP exists and is located by the
DMOD. If the auto-started TP is configured to run the same application as the
operator-started TP, the TP should execute successfully. If the auto-started TP
is not correctly configured or is configured to run a different program than the
operator-started TP, the incoming Attach message may fail with the symptoms
described earlier or may result in some other error.

WORKAROUND
==========

Operator-started transaction programs do not require registry entries defining
them as auto-started invokable transaction programs to an SNA Server computer.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To stop the errors from occurring, delete the registry entries for the
operator-started invokable transaction program.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 2.
