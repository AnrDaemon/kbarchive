TITLE   :ALT+PAGE DOWN and ALT+PAGE UP Change Keyboard Locale
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you press ALT+PAGE DOWN or ALT+PAGE UP to change the active window within a
Terminal Server session, the defined keyboard locale also changes if multiple
keyboards are defined.

CAUSE
=====

Each active window is permitted to have its own keyboard locale. Therefore, when
you change windows, the keyboard locale changes to the locale that had
previously been set for that window. In addition, if you have the ALT+SHIFT key
combination set as the locale toggle sequence (this is the default), the
ALT+SHIFT+TAB sequence is sent when you press ALT+PAGE DOWN or ALT+PAGE UP. This
causes the locale to be toggled as well.

RESOLUTION
==========

In Terminal Server, you can set the keyboard locale toggle by using the Keyboard
tool in Control Panel. Set the locale toggle to either CTRL+SHIFT or none. This
causes ALT+PAGE DOWN and ALT+PAGE UP not to toggle the locales.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
