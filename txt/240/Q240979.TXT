======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use your Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2-based client computer
to create a folder on an NTFS partition, you may receive the following error
message:

   Unable to create directory

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because to create a folder on a Microsoft Windows NT-based
server, Windows 95 (versions 4.00.950, retail, and 4.00.950A, Service Release 1)
submitted an SMB "C make directory" command to the server, which succeeded.
Instead of making a Create Directory application programming interface (API)
call which results in an SMB "C make directory" command, Windows 95 OEM Service
Release 2 (OSR2) first sends an SMB "C search directory" command to see if the
folder to create already exists. In the case where the new folder does not
exist, the server returns a NO_MORE_FILES error (no matching folder found), the
client does not issue the "C make directory" command, and then generates the
error message above.
