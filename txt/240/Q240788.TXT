TITLE   :XIMS: Outbound Limitation Works Improperly Post 5.5 SP2
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply one of the Internet Mail Service post-Exchange Server 5.5.
Service Pack 2 (SP2) hotfixes from 2607 to 2650 on an Exchange Server 5.5 SP2
computer, the outbound limitation, which is configured for a specific domain
does not work correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is introduced by the resolution of a previous problem, which is
actually a new feature. For additional information about this new feature,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q231303 XFOR: New Feature for Setting Size Limit for Internet Mail Service

In the feature, a new registry key, OutboundSizeLimit is created, which uses
numbers in bytes, so other configurations are changed to use numbers in bytes,
too. But the configurations of maximum message size that are specified for each
individual domain still use numbers in kilobytes, so the comparison returns an
incorrect result.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Internet Mail Service

+----------------------------+
| File name    | Version     | 
+----------------------------+
| Msexcimc.exe | 5.5.2650.21 | 
+----------------------------+
| Imcmsg.dll   | 5.5.2650.21 | 
+----------------------------+


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 2. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server
5.5 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Problem
------------------------------

1. On the Internet Mail tab of the Internet Mail Service Properties page, click
   on the E-Mail Domain button next to Specify by E-Mail Domain.

2. Add a domain. Specify a value in the Maximum Size field. The value that is
   entered is divided by 1024 when it is used. For example, if 2,000 KB is
   entered, only messages that are less than 2 KB can be sent out.

This regression is introduced after SP2.
