TITLE   :Multithreaded Program May Wait Forever on WaitForMultipleObjects
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4,4.0 SP5,4.0 SP6
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Any multithreaded program may wait forever on a WaitForMultipleObjects call when
waiting on multiple mutexes. This behavior occurs when the thread making the API
call is already holding one on the mutexes.

For example, assume a program with two threads and two mutexes. Thread A owns
mutex 1 and thread B owns mutex 2. If thread A calls WaitForMultipleObjects on
both mutex 1 and mutex 2 with bWaitAll=TRUE, the call waits for mutex 2 to be
released by thread B. However, the call never returns, even after thread B
releases mutex 2.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Windows NT kernel is not handling the
WaitForMultipleObjects call correctly for multiple mutexes.
