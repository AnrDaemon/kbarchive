TITLE   :Command Failed Error Occurs When Using SNACFG
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,4.0 SP1,4.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use the SNA Server command line utility Snacfg.exe to edit the
Host Account Cache from a computer in a remote Windows NT domain, the following
error message may occur:

   Command Failed

Example:

   SNACFG #Drive:\path\com.cfg HSMAPPING ABC\USERXXX /ADD /HSDOMAIN:LMVSTS
   /HSUSER:XXXX

CAUSE
=====

Snacfg.exe does not support the use of these commands from a Windows NT domain
that is different than the Windows NT domain where the master Windows NT Account
Synchronization (SNAPMP) service is running.

This behavior is by design.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following criteria must be met in order to properly run Snacfg.exe:

 - The user must be a member of the domain where the Windows NT Password
   Synchronization Service has been installed.

 - Because Snacfg.exe requires some additional SNA Server Manager components to
   function properly, Snacfg.exe must be run from a computer that also has SNA
   Server or the SNA Server client for Windows NT with SNA Server Manager
   installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the user logged in is not a member of the domain where the Windows NT
Password Synchronization Service has been installed, a trust relationship must
be established between the two domains.

Domains, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
