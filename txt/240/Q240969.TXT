TITLE   :NDIS May Not Return Proper Multicast Address List After a Reset
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you quit a program (such as Network Monitor, from the Microsoft Systems
Management Server CD-ROM) that resets the network adapter to turn off
Promiscuous mode, the network adapter's registers for the multicast address
appear to be cleared. A query to NDIS for OID_802_3_MULTICAST_LIST results in
NDIS returning an empty list. However, the proper address list is actually still
present in the network adapter and the empty list is being returned incorrectly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
