TITLE   :Error Message: Web Publishing Wizard Advanced INF Install INF...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you set root drive mapping and run compatibility scripts for Microsoft
Office 97 and Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 on your Terminal Server-based
computer, if you upgrade to Microsoft Office 2000 and create new users, you may
receive the following error message when you log on a user and the user's
profile is built:

   Personalized Settings
   Setting up personalized settings for:

   WEB PUBLISHING WIZARD ADVANCED INF INSTALL INF FAILURE. REASON ACCESS IS
   DENIED.

If you click OK, you can continue but the Web Publishing Wizard is not set up.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if the Setup.ini file does not exist. The Internet Explorer
4.0 compatibility script creates a Setup.ini file in the %SystemRoot% folder
that holds information related to Internet Explorer 4.0. When you upgrade to
Office 2000, the Setup.ini file is deleted. The Web Publishing Wizard needs the
Setup.ini file to write .inf files for proper operation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, manually create a Setup.ini file:

1. Start Notepad.

2. Create a blank file and name it Setup.ini.

3. Save the file to the %SystemRoot% folder.
