Paintbrush does not have a set of on-screen rulers that you can use to
gauge the size of your drawings. However, you can use the Image
Attributes command to set the size of your drawing area, as follows:

1. Start Paintbrush.

2. From the Option menu, choose Image Attributes.

3. Select In (inches) from the Units section.

4. Select Width and type a value for the horizontal size that you want your
   image to be.

5. Select Height and type a value for the vertical size that you want your image
   to be.

6. Choose OK.

7. From the File menu, choose New.

8. The drawing screen size will now be the exact size of the image to be drawn.
