SUMMARY
=======

You may be unable to print from Aldus PageMaker versions 3.00 and 3.01 when
running PageMaker with Microsoft Windows version 3.0. This problem may occur
even if the selected printer is the Windows default printer. Choosing the target
printer from both Windows and PageMaker resolves this problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Run printer setup from PageMaker as follows:

1. From the PageMaker File menu, choose Printer Setup.

2. Select the printer you want to use from the list of installed printers.
   PageMaker only displays those installed printers that are designated as
   "active."

3. Choose Setup.

4. If the displayed printer is the correct one, choose OK. If not, scroll
   through the options until you get to the right one and choose OK.

5. Keep choosing OK until you get out of Printer Setup.

6. PageMaker will now give you a dialog box that says "Reformat entire
   publication?" Choose OK.

7. From the File menu, choose Print.

If you save the changes made to this file, it will print properly the next time.
Aldus has confirmed that this is designed behavior for PageMaker versions 3.00
and 3.01.

The product included here, Aldus Pagemaker, is manufactured by vendors
