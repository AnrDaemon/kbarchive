If PROGMAN.EXE is started from the RUN= line in the WIN.INI file and
appears in the SHELL= line in the SYSTEM.INI file, Program Manager
always comes up minimized when Windows is run, regardless of the
state it was in when Windows changes were saved on exit.

If MS-DOS or Windows applications are executed from the RUN= line in
the [Windows] section of the WIN.INI file, the Program Manager is minimized
also.

PROGMAN.EXE is not automatically minimized if it is started from the LOAD=
line in the WIN.INI.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.0 3.0a 3.00a win30
