SUMMARY
=======

When printing with the Epson 9- and 24-pin printer drivers, if the printer
output seems to be printing in the wrong orientation, check to see if the paper
orientation corresponds to the paper height and paper width set from the Control
Panel or Printer Setup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the Epson 9- and 24-pin printer drivers, the page orientation will
automatically switch from portrait to landscape whenever you set the paper
height to a size less than the paper width or from landscape to portrait
whenever you set the paper width to a size less than the paper height. This is
indicated by the blackened radio buttons under the orientation section of the
Epson (9- or 24-pin) printer driver dialog box.

You can manually set the printer orientation to a setting that is opposite of
what it was automatically set to by the Control Panel when the paper height and
width is adjusted; however this will have no effect on the output. For example,
if the Control Panel automatically set the orientation from portrait to
landscape when you adjusted the paper height and width, and you manually changed
the orientation back to portrait, the output will still print in landscape.
