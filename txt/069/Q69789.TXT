======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

In Aircraft & Scenery Designer, if you choose option 5, Dynamic Scenery
Active, from the Scenery Designer menu to deactivate dynamic scenery, random
dynamic scenery generated by Microsoft Flight Simulator version 4.00 will be
unaffected. The Dynamic Scenery Active option only affects user-created dynamic
scenery stored in the active DY1 file.

Flight Simulator's own dynamic scenery may be turned off in the start-up menus,
or by doing the following:

1. From the Enviro menu, choose option E, Dynamic Scenery.

2. Deactivate options 1-5 (when an option is active, it will be preceded by a +
   [plus] sign).
