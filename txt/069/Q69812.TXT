======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

Flight timing gates may be added to form race courses in Microsoft Flight
Simulator Aircraft & Scenery Designer version 4.00. The following rules are
applied when the score is determined:

Air Race Rules
--------------

1. The race begins after passing through start gate.

2. The race ends after passing through the finish gate.

3. If the middle gates are missed, the race continues. You can miss any number
   of middle gates, but doing so will decrease your score.

Scoring:

1. 1-20 point bonus based on how close to the center of the gate the plane
   passes for each gate

2. Additional bonus points based on speed, determined by the following formula:

   (speed in knots) * (# of gates passed through) / 4

3. Additional 25 bonus points per gate if you pass through every gate

MORE INFORMATION
================

Top 10 scores are displayed on a score board after passing the finish gate.
Scores below the top 10 are dropped.

You can create only one race course per scenery file.
