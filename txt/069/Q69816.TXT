SYMPTOMS
========

The BRAKES indicator appear stuck on, as though the brakes are being
continuously applied, when you are using a joystick. This symptom indicates that
Flight Simulator is receiving an "on" signal from the game card (as if one of
the joystick buttons is being depressed).

RESOLUTION

If brakes are always on there may be a problem with the game card, such as a
faulty chip. If you experience this problem, contact the game card
manufacturer.

Disable and unplug the joystick.
