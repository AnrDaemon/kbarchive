TITLE   :Reinitializing After Changing Editor Settings Is Very Slow
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities

KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, version 1.1 
 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The current editor settings in the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) may be changed
by choosing Editor Settings from the Options menu, making a change to the
<assign> pseudofile, and then saving that file. If SHIFT+F8 (initialize)
is pressed while the <assign> pseudofile is still displayed, PWB may
appear as though it is hung; it is actually reinitializing each statement of the
editor settings (<assign>) pseudofile.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following steps will reproduce this behavior:

1. Enter PWB and select the Options menu.

2. Choose the Editor Settings menu.

3. Make a change in the <assign> pseudofile and then save it.

4. Press the "initialize" keystroke combination (SHIFT+F8) and a popup box will
   appear stating "reinitializing...". The reinitialization is actually taking
   place but it is very slow because PWB is rebuilding the <assign>
   pseudofile for each entry in your TOOLS.INI file.

This behavior does not occur in PWB version 1.00. Version 1.10 includes a change
to the earlier version; you can see a new assignment (made via "arg textarg
<assign>") immediately updated if you are viewing the <assign>
pseudofile.

This is expected behavior because the <assign> pseudofile is meant to show
the settings that were in effect at the time the file was displayed. It is not
recommended that it be dynamically updated except via the mechanism of actually
editing the file. If you changed a setting via "arg textarg assign" (ALT+A
textarg ALT+=), a better way to view your new setting(s) is by using "refresh"
(SHIFT+F7), or by switching away and back again via "setfile" (F2).
