SUMMARY
=======

You can create a batch file called WINSTART.BAT to load memory-resident
utilities in Windows applications. This gives you more conventional memory to
run DOS applications under Microsoft Windows version 3.00. Microsoft LAN Manager
and some other network drivers will not load properly using WINSTART.BAT. If the
network driver does load, an error message is displayed on exit because there is
no way to unload the driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Microsoft LAN Manager is loaded with WINSTART.BAT, you will receive the
following error message:

   The Workstation has not been started
   Error spawning C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG\NETWKSTA.EXE

When the logon command is completed, it will respond with the following error
message:

   The workstation has already been started

Windows will then display a warning that full API support has not been loaded and
the network will be unavailable. The only workaround is to load the network
before running Windows.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
