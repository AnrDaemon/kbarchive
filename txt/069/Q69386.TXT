SUMMARY
=======

When printing complex print jobs to a Banyan Vines network printer from Windows
3.0, the output may be split into multiple jobs if the Banyan SETPRINT spool
delay setting is not set correctly.

The spool delay controls how long the network waits for additional print output
before timing out and prematurely terminating the print job. Subsequent output
would be placed in one or more other jobs. Also, if you are using temporarily
downloaded soft fonts, only the text from the first portion of the job would
print using the correct fonts.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You may increase the spool delay by using the Banyan command

      SETPRINT port "address" /D:nn

where nn is the number of seconds for the spool delay. For example, to increase
the delay to 15 seconds, use:

      SETPRINT LPT1 "LASERII" /D:15

Increase the spool delay until the job prints properly.
