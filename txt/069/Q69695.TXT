The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The installation programs for the Microsoft Mail server, MS-DOS client, and
Windows client do not modify the CONFIG.SYS file. You MUST add the following
line to support the use of the drive letter M as the default Mail database
drive:

   LASTDRIVE=Z

By default, MS-DOS can only access five drive devices (A-E) without the use of
the LASTDRIVE statement. To function properly, the line should be added if the
default drive letter (M) is to be used.

This does not apply to Novell; Novell recommends that you set the LASTDRIVE
statement to the last PHYSICAL local disk drive and not the last possible drive
letter.
