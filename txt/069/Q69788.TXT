======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

Due to the complexity of the 747 enhanced panel, it cannot be moved or sized;
however, the original Flight Simulator control panel (that is, the Cessna panel)
can be moved and sized.

Lack of this feature is by design in Aircraft & Scenery Designer version
4.00.
