The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following error message may occur when you are installing a Microsoft Mail
form on a Microsoft Mail server:

   Couldn't allocate the forms list properly. You may be low on memory.

This error occurs when you use the Mail version 2.00 Form Designer to install a
form on a Mail 3.00 server. You must use the Mail 3.00 Form Designer to install
a form on a Mail 3.00 server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you click the Form Mover button to install the form on the server, the
script for the button looks for a stack called Form Designer. If this stack
can't be found, an Open dialog box appears asking you to locate the stack called
Form Designer. The above error message will occur if the Mail version 2.00 Form
Designer, not the Mail version 3.00 Form Designer, is automatically opened or is
selected in the Open dialog box.
