SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Windows enhanced mode, when an application calls the OpenIcon or
ShowWindows functions to activate a full-screen MS-DOS application from an icon,
the activation fails. These functions perform as documented in real and standard
mode.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, simulate the result of an ALT+TAB key combination on the
MS-DOS application icon: Send a WM_ACTIVATE message to the MS-DOS application,
and then specify its handle in a call to ShowWindow function. For example:

      SendMessage(hDOSApp, WM_ACTIVATE, 1, MAKELONG(hDOSApp, TRUE));
      ShowWindow(hDOSApp, SW_SHOWNORMAL);

When the application sends the WM_ACTIVATE message, wParam is set to 1 because
the application is being invoked by simulating the keyboard. The high-order word
of lParam is set to TRUE (non-zero) because the MS-DOS application is
represented by an icon.

The method works in all three Windows modes for windowed and full- screen MS-DOS
applications.
