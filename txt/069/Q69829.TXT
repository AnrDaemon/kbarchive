The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

Tandy Corporation recommends the following settings to run Microsoft Windows 3.0
in 386 enhanced mode on a Tandy 4000 computer with a SCSI hard drive:

 - The /b- switch should be used when loading SMARTDrive in the CONFIG.SYS file.
   Most of the SCSI hard drives with Tandy 4000 computers have Adaptec
   controllers. The /b- switch turns off double buffering.

   NOTE: The /b- switch would come after the Normal and Minimum Cache size
   settings. An example of this is:

   Device=C:\Windows\Smartdrv.Sys 2048 1024 /B-

 - The line for HIMEM.SYS must be the first device line in the CONFIG.SYS file:

   Device=C:\Himem.Sys

 - The following line must be added to the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI:

   VirtualhdIrq=False

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the ROM BIOS for the SCSI hard drive is version 2.0, 2.0c or earlier, then
the device driver SCSIHA.SYS must be loaded through the CONFIG.SYS file. This is
needed for proper operation in enhanced mode. If the ROM BIOS is version 4.05s,
5.05s, or later, then no additional device driver needs to be loaded.
