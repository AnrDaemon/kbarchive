The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can enter any special ASCII characters into a file in the MS-DOS Editor by
pressing CTRL+P and then ALT+<ASCII character code>.

NOTE: You must use the numeric keypad to enter the ASCII character code.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The escape character is one type of ASCII character. There are three ways to
enter this character:

 - Press CTRL+P, then ALT+027

 - Press CTRL+P, then CTRL+[

 - Press CTRL+P, then ESC.

When you use any of the above methods, a left arrow representing the escape
character is displayed.

The only special character MS-DOS Editor does not always accept is the CTRL+Z
character (ALT 026). If you press CTRL+Z on a line with other text, the
character is accepted. However, if CTRL+Z is the only character on the line,
MS-DOS Editor removes it from the file. If you start Edlin with the /B option,
you can enter CTRL+Z on its own line. The /B option forces Edlin to ignore
end-of-file (EOF) characters.
