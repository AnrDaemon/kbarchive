RESOLUTION
==========

According to Packard-Bell Technical Support, the Packard-Bell PB1000, a 12MHz
286 must have the line "PadCodeSegments=1" (without the quotation marks) in the
[STANDARD] section of the SYSTEM.INI file for the machine to function properly.

Use any text editor to add this line to the SYSTEM.INI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The PB1000 is not listed as a supported machine on the Windows Hardware
Compatibility List, and the addition of this line is not guaranteed to
completely solve the above problems; however, it should reduce the frequency
with which they occur.
