-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Printers option in Control Panel allows a maximum of 15 printer drivers to
be installed. If you reach this limit, the following message is displayed:

   Maximum number of printers already installed

During Windows installation, there is a limit of eight printer drivers that can
be installed. However, after initial setup, you can install a total of 15
printer drivers. An attempt to install more than 15 results in the message noted
above.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The above error message can also be caused by a corrupted WIN.INI file. For
instructions about how to rebuild the WIN.INI file, query on the following words
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   create and win.ini and without and third-party

You can install more than 15 printers by choosing the Add button and selecting
Unlisted Printer Or Updated Printer in the List Of Printers box.

Microsoft cannot guarantee the reliability of Windows if more than 15 printers
are installed. If the WIN.INI file exceeds the maximum size, you may experience
system crashes or data loss. In addition, some third-party Windows-based
applications may not be able to handle large WIN.INI files, or may cause general
protection (GP) faults because of the excessively large [PrinterPorts] section.

Additional query words: gpf 3.00 3.0 3.0a 3.00a 3.1 3.10 3.11 win31 win30 fault windrvr
