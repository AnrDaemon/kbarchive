SUMMARY
=======

Adobe Type Manager (ATM) for Windows is an add-in program that creates matching
screen and printer fonts in Microsoft Windows version 3.0 for dot matrix, HP
LaserJet, and PostScript printers. It works in standard and enhanced mode, but
not real mode and gives a WYSIWYG display environment.

This package has a built-in soft font installer so that most Adobe-compatible
Type 1 soft fonts can be used. It also supports the Lasermaster series of
printers. This program uses approximately 240K or more memory depending on the
size of the font cache that is used. The font cache is where built bit-mapped
fonts are stored during a Windows session.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Adobe Type manager is installed from within Windows 3.00, it does the
following:

1. It creates two new directories: PCLFONTS and PSFONTS. These are the
   directories where .PFM files (font metric file used for screen display) and
   .PFB files (printer font file) are stored for the different printers.

2. It builds an ATM.INI file that contains a listing of available fonts and
   internal ATM settings, then copies this file to the Windows subdirectory. It
   also copies ATMCNTRL.EXE to this directory and makes backup copies of the
   SYSTEM.INI and WIN.INI files with the .BAK extension.

3. ATM edits the WIN.INI and adds font information. For example, it would add
   the following under the [HPPCL5A,LPT1] section of the WIN.INI file if you are
   using an HP LaserJet series III:

         softfonts=4 (or the number of fonts added)
         softfont1=c:\pclfonts\xxxx.pfm,c:\pclfonts\xxxx.sfp)

4. ATM edits the SYSTEM.INI, and under the [boot] section, it changes

   system.drv=system.drv

   to

   system.drv=atmsys.drv

   It then adds a new entry under this section,

   atm.system.drv= system.drv

If ATM is installed when Word for Windows is not running, delete the WINWORD.INI
file in the Word for Windows directory to update the font choices and show the
new fonts installed.
