SUMMARY
=======

When Windows Terminal is started from the File Manager or Program Manager, it
automatically looks for and loads the TERMINAL.TRM settings file if one exists.

You can use this feature to specify your preferred terminal settings; then, every
time you start Terminal, it uses that configuration.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Specify whatever settings you desire (for example, Communications, Modem
Commands, Terminal Preferences, etc.) and save them to a file named TERMINAL.TRM
in the default directory (usually C:\WINDOWS).

Terminal automatically looks for this file in the default/current/working
directory, and loads those settings on startup.

NOTE: The TERMINAL.TRM file must be in default/current/working directory when you
start Terminal. By default, this is the Windows directory, but if you specify a
different directory in the "Working Directory" field (in Program Manager File
Properties), Terminal looks for the TERMINAL.TRM file in that directory.
