SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Word adds a page break if a table is too long to fit on the page. Part
of the table may be on one page, while the rest of the table is forced to the
next page. If the table is small enough to fit on a page, use the following
method to force Word to keep the rows of the table.

1. Select the table.

2. On the Format menu, click Paragraph.

3. Click the Line And Page Breaks tab.

4. Click to select the Keep With Next check box, and click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Word places a page break in a table if a single row or several rows are too long
to fit between the top and bottom margins of the page. Also, any text on a page
can cause the table to break between pages. To correct this problem, adjust the
top and bottom margins so that the table fits on the page (or use the steps
outlined in the "Summary" section of this article).
