SUMMARY
=======

Problems:

I have the OS/2 LAN Manager version 2.0 Network Device Driver Kit (NDDK) and am
working on an Ethernet version of remote boot. The documentation that comes with
the NDDK describes where to put the new .DLLs that come with the NDDK, but the
documentation makes no mention of replacing the COMTOKR.SYS file that comes with
OS/2 LAN Manager version 2.0. I thought COMTOKR.SYS was only for use on Token
Ring networks.

Response:

COMTOKR.SYS works similar to a transport stack such as NETBEUI.SYS. Just as
NETBEUI.SYS can be "bound" to either a Token-Ring or Ethernet MAC driver, so can
COMTOKR.SYS.

To bind COMTOKR.SYS to an Ethernet MAC driver, add a BINDINGS keyword to the
[COMTOKR] section of PROTOCOL.INI. Specify the name of the Ethernet MAC section,
just as you would for NetBEUI.

To use the Ethernet .DLLs with COMTOKR.SYS, add them to the [REMOTEBOOT] section
of LANMAN.INI using a RPLx keyword. For example:

   RPL1 = ETHNET1.DLL ETHNET2.DLL ETHOEM.DLL

If the Ethernet card is not on NET1, place the network number, minus 1, just
after RPLOEM.DLL. Thus, if NET2 is Ethernet, you should use the following
statement:

   RPL2 = ETHNET1.DLL ETHNET2.DLL ETHOEM.DLL 1

Additional query words: 2.00 2.10 2.10a 2.20
