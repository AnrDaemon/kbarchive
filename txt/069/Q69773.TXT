SUMMARY
=======

Backing up the Mail database is a key responsibility of the Mail system
administrator and consists of saving ALL files, from where the Mail database
normally resides, to an alternate media.

The media can be floppy disks, a streaming tape drive, or another computer on the
network. The XCOPY or BACKUP command in MS-DOS can be used to perform the backup
procedure.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is very important that the ENTIRE Mail database be backed up. A mail system
database contains zero length files and empty directories. Whatever the backup
method being used, make sure the Backup utility backs up empty directories and
zero length files.

You CANNOT back up a portion of the database. Remember, a few minutes of backup
can save many hours of potential anguish if the original file is lost. Backing
up the executables directory is not required because these files can be
retrieved from the original system disks.

Additionally, it is important that no users are using the mail system during the
backup process. If messages are being sent during this operation, it is likely
you will copy a file that is in the stages of partial update.
