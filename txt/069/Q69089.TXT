Manifest is a diagnostic program distributed by Quarterdeck Office
Systems, the makers of QEMM386.

If the Manifest EMS Performance Test is run with EMM386 loaded on a
COMPAQ 386 machine, it will crash if the mouse is moved during the
test.

This is a problem with Manifest's detection of the extended BIOS data
area (XBDA). The problem may not occur with other memory managers that
relocate the XBDA, such as COMPAQ'S CEMM, or Quarterdeck QEMM386.
