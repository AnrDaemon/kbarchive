TITLE   :BUG: PWB 1.1 Dialog Boxes Blink After Dialog Help Is Obtained
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:1.1; OS/2:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, version 1.1 
 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When working with the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) version 1.10 under MS-DOS,
there are several instances where a dialog box may start flashing incorrectly.
This situation occurs when you obtain help on a PWB informational pop-up dialog
box and then return from the Help dialog screen. At this point you may find that
the original dialog box is rapidly blinking.

This problem may occur when trying to get help on a topic for which there is no
help, trying to use an unassigned key, or when PWB informs you that you changed
a file but didn't save it before you tried to exit. In each of these cases, PWB
gives you a pop-up dialog box informing you of the situation. If you get help on
this informational dialog box and then press ESC or click Cancel, the original
dialog box will start blinking.

This is not normal behavior, however, PWB is still fully functional and you may
proceed by selecting an appropriate choice from the flashing dialog box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Programmer's WorkBench
version 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
as it becomes available.
