SUMMARY
=======

Logitech ships some of its Logitech serial and bus mice bundled with Microsoft
Windows 3.0. Logitech has upgraded the MOUSE.SYS and MOUSE.COM driver and
modified the SETUP.INF file included with Windows 3.0. If you are experiencing
problems with this version of the Logitech mouse driver, you should contact
Logitech technical support.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can tell if you have a modified version of Microsoft Windows 3.0 that was
bundled with the Logitech mouse if there is no listing under the Windows Setup
procedure for the Logitech serial mouse, Logitech bus mouse, or Logitech PS/2
mouse. These have been replaced with a "Logitech Plus" or "Logitech +" mouse
driver listing.

The Logitech products included here are manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
