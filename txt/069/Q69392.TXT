MORE INFORMATION
================

GENIUS GM-6X
------------

The GENIUS GM-6X mouse is a three-button mouse that does not emulate the
Microsoft Mouse. Configure the mouse for use with Windows as follows:

1. Install the Windows Mouse Systems (or Vision) on COMx.

2. Remove the Microsoft MOUSE.SYS mouse driver from the CONFIG.SYS file if
   installed.

3. Insert GMOUSE.COM in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

4. Save your changes and restart your system.

GENIUS GM-F302, GM-F303, or GM-6000
-----------------------------------

These three models can emulate either a Mouse Systems Mouse or Microsoft Mouse. A
switch on the bottom of the mouse allows you to toggle the emulation mode from
two-button Microsoft emulation to three-button Mouse Systems Mouse emulation.
Configure the mouse for use with Windows as follows:

1. Install the Windows-compatible GENIUS mouse driver that corresponds with the
   GENIUS mouse setting.

2. Remove the Microsoft MOUSE.SYS mouse driver from the CONFIG.SYS file.

3. Install either one of the Mouse drivers supplied with the GENIUS mouse. Use
   the GMOUSE.SYS driver in the CONFIG.SYS file or the GMOUSE.COM driver in the
   AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

4. Save your changes and restart your system.
