The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Toshiba T5100 and T3200 laptops have EGA gas plasma displays. When Microsoft
Windows 3.0 or 3.1 are installed as EGA, labels of selected icons and title bars
of active windows are invisible.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the problem, install the video display enhancement program XCHAD.EXE
available from Toshiba.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Toshiba provides this screen utility for its laptop gas plasma displays. XCHAD
provides brightness and contrast control for the Toshiba gas plasma display. By
creating a batch file or putting an XCHAD.EXE command in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file,
the screen contrast can be greatly enhanced.

The XCHAD.EXE program is on the Toshiba Diagnostics and Supplemental disk you
receive with the Toshiba DOS disks.

Creating a Batch File
---------------------

1. Using Windows Notepad or another text editor, create the following batch file
   and save it in your WINDOWS directory as WINPLSMA.BAT.

         XCHAD 0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3 /M10
         WIN

2. Exit Windows and start it again using WINPLSMA.BAT.

You may also improve the video display contrast by setting the Color Schemes to
Fluorescent under Color from the Control Panel settings.
