The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows Task Manager does not work if the SYSTEM.INI file entry for the Windows
Task Manager is incorrect, or the file TASKMAN.EXE is damaged or missing.

If the following line appears in the [BOOT] section of the SYSTEM.INI file, the
Windows Task Manager (TASKMAN.EXE) does not load:

         taskman.exe=

MORE INFORMATION
================

For the Windows Task Manager to function correctly, either remove the above line
from the SYSTEM.INI file or change the line to:

   taskman.exe=taskman.exe

If the TASKMAN.EXE file is not in the search path or if it has been removed,
deleted, or renamed, the Task List will not appear when you double-click the
Desktop or press CTRL+ESC.

Verify that the TASKMAN.EXE file is located in the WINDOWS directory. TASKMAN.EXE
can be expanded from the original Windows disks into the WINDOWS directory using
the EXPAND.EXE utility.

Windows 3.0, 3.0a: Expanding TASKMAN.EXE
----------------------------------------

For Windows 3.0, copy the EXPAND.EXE program from disk 1 to your WINDOWS
directory and use the following command:

   expand a:taskman.exe c:\windows\taskman.exe

Windows 3.1: Expanding TASKMAN.EXE
----------------------------------

For Windows 3.1, use the following command:

   expand a:taskman.ex_ c:\windows\taskman.exe

By default, Windows loads the Task Manager. The TASKMAN.EXE= line in the
SYSTEM.INI file was designed to allow the use of other Task Managing programs in
Windows. If the above line exists, Task Switching capabilities still function by
pressing ALT+TAB if the following line is in the [WINDOWS] section of the
WIN.INI file:

   COOLSWITCH=1
