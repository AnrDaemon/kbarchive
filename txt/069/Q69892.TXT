======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The documentation for the EXPORTS statement in the module-definition file on
pages 10-4 and 10-5 of the "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit Reference
Volume 2" for versions 3.0 and 3.1 is incomplete.

RESOLUTION
==========

The name of any function that is called using the C calling convention must be
preceded with an underscore (_) when it is listed in the EXPORTS section.

For example, listed below is the declaration for the MyVarArgs function:

     int FAR CDECL MyVarArgs(LPSTR lpArgList, ...)

In the DEF file, the MyVarArgs function would be exported with the following
statement:

     EXPORTS
       _MyVarArgs

Additional query words: 3.00 3.10 docerr
