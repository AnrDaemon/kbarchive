======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Quarterdeck's QEMM386 memory manager version 5.11 or earlier causes any program
that uses expanded memory to reboot the system after you exit Microsoft Windows
version 3.0. For example, if you start Microsoft Word for MS-DOS, version 5.0 or
5.5, immediately after you exit Windows, the system will reboot.

CAUSE
=====

Quarterdeck Systems has confirmed this to be a problem with versions 5.11 and
earlier of the QEMM386 driver.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can avoid the problem by doing the following:

1. Start Word with the /x switch to disable Word's use of expanded memory.

2. Use the extended memory manager HIMEM.SYS included with Windows 3.0 (instead
   of QEMM386.SYS).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Quarterdeck corrected the problem in the QEMM386 memory manager version 5.12. A
complementary upgrade to version 5.12 can be obtained from Quarterdeck's
technical support.
