SUMMARY
=======

The Windows 3.0 SWAPFILE utility cannot be used to create a permanent swapfile
on drives larger than 509.5 MB under COMPAQ DOS 3.31. SWAPFILE cannot recognize
such drives. To create a swapfile on this type of system, limit the size of
logical drives to no more than 509.5 MB.

This problem usually occurs with COMPAQ Type 49, 650 MB drives.

MORE INFORMATION
================

COMPAQ DOS 3.31 used a proprietary greater-than-32-MB partitioning scheme that
allowed logical drives larger than 512 MB in size. This problem does not occur
with DOS versions 4.01 or later, which limit logical drive size to 512 MB.

The product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft;
