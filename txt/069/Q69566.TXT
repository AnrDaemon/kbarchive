SUMMARY
=======

If you leave out a new name when renaming a file from Microsoft Windows version
3.0 File Manager, the renamed file has the same name as the directory it is
renamed from. For example, if you rename README.TXT without a new name within
the Windows directory, the file's new name is WINDOWS, with no extension.

NOTE: This problem does not occur in later versions of Windows.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.0 3.0a 3.00a win30
