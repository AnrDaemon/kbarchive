The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0b, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail server may occasionally hang when it is subject to a large
amount of server activity. This behavior has primarily been observed on
Macintosh II's but may also occur on the Macintosh SE, SE/30, IIx, or IIcx. The
problem described will typically occur under high-stress conditions, such as
when a large image message is read simultaneously on two separate workstations.

To correct this problem, update the disk drivers with the Apple HD SC Setup
program that is shipped with System versions 6.0.5 and later. Microsoft has been
unable to reproduce the problem when using the updated disk drivers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The driver update procedure does not reformat the hard disk. For safety reasons,
a backup of the Microsoft Mail data file should be made before attempting to
update the disk drivers.

For more information on the Apple HD SC Setup program, see the "Macintosh System
Software User's Guide" for System version 6.0.5.
