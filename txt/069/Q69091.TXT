======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When executed from the MS-DOS command prompt, Novell's Map Insert or Map Ins
command normally adds the new drive letter variable to the existing path
statement.

However, if you execute this command from the MS-DOS Prompt inside Microsoft
Windows version 3.0, it does not add the new drive letter variable to the
existing path statement.

RESOLUTION
==========

Novell fixed this problem with the version 3.55 MAP.EXE. You can determine the
version of MAP.EXE that you are running by using the Novell VERSION.EXE program.
