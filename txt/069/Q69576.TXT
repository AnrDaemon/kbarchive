SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft MS-DOS "IF ERRORLEVEL <number>" statement checks for error
levels of the given number or greater. If you want to check for a specific error
level, you should use the following command construct

   IF ERRORLEVEL <N> IF NOT ERRORLEVEL <N+1> <COMMAND>

where <N> is the desired number. The <N+1> portion of the command
must be calculated as the command is entered, because the MS-DOS command
interpreter cannot perform mathematical calculations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The nested IF statements allow specific selection of an error level because the
NOT operator effectively reverses the inequality. The command

   IF ERRORLEVEL 5 ...

is equivalent to the algebraic construct

   IF E = 5 OR E > 5 THEN ...

while the command

   IF NOT ERRORLEVEL 6

is equivalent to the algebraic construct:

   IF E < 6 THEN ...

The combination of the two IF commands works as described because the second IF
is executed only if the first is true, and the <command> is executed only
if the second is true; therefore, the combination of the two commands is
executed only if BOTH are true. Because the desired error level is bracketed
with the two tests, the entire conditional is TRUE only when ERRORLEVEL is
exactly that value.

This same syntax can be expanded to cover a sequential range of ERRORLEVEL return
codes by increasing the difference between the values checked for.
