SUMMARY
=======

When installing a third party video driver for Microsoft Windows version 3.00,
the line DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EGA.SYS is added to the CONFIG.SYS file if Windows is
allowed to modify this file. Windows does not copy over the EGA.SYS file when
installing some third party drivers, so the error message

   Bad or Missing C:\WINDOWS\EGA.SYS

will appear when the system is booted.

The EGA.SYS file should be copied from the Windows disks and expanded if the
graphics display is EGA. If not, the DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EGA.SYS is not necessary
and can be deleted from the CONFIG.SYS. For more information on expanding files,
query on the following words:

   expanding and original

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows version 3.00.
This problem was corrected in Microsoft Windows 3.00a.
