-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When Windows 3.0 is set up on a network workstation via the SETUP /N command,
there are 13 files copied to or created in the user's directory on either the
server or the user's local hard disk.

It is possible to copy other important files on the individual workstations by
editing the SETUP.INF before running the SETUP /N command.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the following outline to copy additional files to individual workstations
via the SETUP.INF file.

1. Copy the file(s) to be placed in everyone's user directory into the shared
   Windows directory on the server.

2. Edit SETUP.INF with a standard ASCII text editor and locate the line:

         [win.copy]

   This is where the different files are copied to different directories such as
   the Windows users' directories. For example:

      2:myfile.txt,     0:

   (This copies myfile.txt from disk 2 into the Windows directory.)

      #net,     0:

   (This copies all files under the [NET] section into the user's Windows
   directory).

3. Locate the [NET] section. It shows the files copied into the individual
   users' directories are CONTROL.INI, SMARTDRV.SYS, RAMDRIVE.SYS, EMM386.SYS,
   and WINVER. Other files are built there such as WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI.

4. Add the following line to the end of this section:

   2:allfile.exe

The disk number is only valid when installing from the Windows disks. It is
ignored when installing from a shared Windows directory.

The SETUP.INF file is a comma delineated text file formatted for 160 columns that
supplies customized directions to the SETUP.EXE.

Preferred Workstation Setup Method
----------------------------------

Install Windows 3.0 on a network (see pages 543-556 of the "Microsoft Windows
User's Guide"), and then run the SETUP /N command on each workstation. In some
instances (for example, large workstation groups) it may not be efficient to do
this and then customize each workstation individually. By editing the SETUP.INF
file with a text editor, it is possible to enhance the SETUP /N command so that
it customizes each workstation to a company standard.

on the server, query on:
