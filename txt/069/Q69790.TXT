SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Flight Simulator Aircraft & Scenery Designer version 4.00, the
EICAS portion of the 747 panel contains several different screens. Features
displayed in the EICAS portion, such as the COM radio, cannot be controlled with
the mouse. The program is not able to detect which screen is displayed to
process mouse pointing and movement. All functionality and features are still
available through menus and the usual keyboard controls.
