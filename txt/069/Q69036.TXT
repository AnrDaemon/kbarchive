The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

Ashton-Tate (Borland) has noted that running the dBASE IV version 4.11
CACHEDB.EXE disk cache with Windows SMARTDrive (SMARTDRIVE.SYS or SMARTDRV.EXE)
causes dBASE and/or Windows to stop responding (hang).

If you use the MS-DOS 5.0, 6.0, or 6.2 versions of SMARTDrive with CACHEDB.EXE,
the following error message is displayed:

   A serious disk error occurred while writing to drive <x>.

where <x> is any hard disk drive letter.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, do not use both disk caches at the same time.

To turn dBASE IV's CACHEDB.EXE disk cache utility off, type the following command
in the dBASE directory:

   CACHEDB OFF

To turn the dBASE IV's disk cache ON, type one of the following commands in the
dBASE directory:

   CACHEDB EXT

(To use extended memory)

   CACHEDB LIM

(To use expanded memory)

Microsoft recommends disabling the dBASE cache because it only helps dBASE,
whereas SMARTDrive helps all applications.
