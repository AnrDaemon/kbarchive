SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Download Center contains a file named MOVECC, which demonstrates
how to simulate the Drag and Drop interface for custom controls. By using the
MoveWindow() function, this sample allows you to click on a control and drag it
to a new location.

MOVECC also demonstrates how to manipulate child window Z-order to prevent
windows from going behind other child windows, and to avoid children painting on
other children.
