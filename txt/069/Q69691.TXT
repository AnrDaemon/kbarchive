The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To set aside virtual memory for Lotus 1-2-3 to use when running under Microsoft
Windows in enhanced mode, add the following line to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file

   SET 123MEMSIZE=<m>

where <m> is the amount of memory in kilobytes you want Windows to allocate
for Lotus 1-2-3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install Lotus 1-2-3 release 3.1, a PIF file called 123.PIF is copied
into the directory in which Lotus resides. If you do not install Lotus into the
default directory (C:\123R3), you must change the path in the Program Filename
entry in the 123.PIF file to the path specified when you installed Lotus.

If you have problems with an invalid path error, make sure the correct path to
the Lotus directory has been added to the path statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT.

The Lotus product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
