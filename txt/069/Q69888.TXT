SUMMARY
=======

Fatal Exit code 0x0506 is not documented in Appendix C of the "Microsoft Windows
Software Development Kit Reference Volume 2" version 3.0.

This Fatal Exit will occur if the GetProfileString() or GetPrivateProfileString()
function is called with the lpDefault parameter set to NULL. lpDefault specifies
a string to return in the lpReturnedString buffer if no match for lpKeyName is
found.

To correct this Fatal Exit, always provide a valid string pointer for the
lpDefault parameter.

GetProfileString() and GetPrivateProfileString() are documented in the Windows
SDK "Reference, Volume 1" for version 3.0 and in the "Programmer's Reference,
Volume 2: Functions" for version 3.1.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.10
