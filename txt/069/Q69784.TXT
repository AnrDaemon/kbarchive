TITLE   :Flt Sim: Cannot Access SubLogic Scenery Disk from Drive B
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Flight Simulator requires that SubLogic scenery disks be loaded from
drive A. For example, if your scenery disk is 3.5 inch and your computer's 3.5
inch drive is drive B, Flight Simulator will not be able to read the disk.

If a hard drive is available, SubLogic scenery may be copied to the hard drive
using the CONVERTS utility provided with Flight Simulator.

For dual floppy systems, contact SubLogic Corporation at (800) 637-4983 to
exchange the disk for the appropriate size.
