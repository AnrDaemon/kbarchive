SYMPTOMS
========

You have a Fast Technologies #1050 hard drive controller card, and your system
stops responding (hangs) at the Windows logo screen or exits to MS-DOS when you
run Microsoft Windows 3.0 in the enhanced mode. Windows functions correctly in
standard or real mode.

BKWRTOFF.COM program turns off the deferred background and writes to the hard
drive. The hard drive controller card can hold reads and writes in static RAM.
Windows can go too fast for this utility and cause problems for the controller.

==========

mode with the Fast Technologies #1050 hard drive controller card, you must have
the following lines must be in the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file:

 - VIRTUALHDIRQ=OFF

 - EMMEXCLUDE= xxxxx-xxxxx

(where xxxxx is the adapter segment address that the controller occupies).

You must also run the BKWRTOFF.COM program before starting Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================
