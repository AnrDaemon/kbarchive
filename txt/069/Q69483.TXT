SUMMARY
=======

According to Future Domain, SMARTDrive may be run with Future Domain's
LDRIVE.SYS driver for its SCSI drive without risk of data loss if LDRIVE.SYS is
loaded after SMARTDrive in the CONFIG.SYS file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

LDRIVE.SYS is a third-party disk partitioning driver that addresses partitions
larger than 32 MB. Microsoft generally recommends that SMARTDrive not be used
when using third-party disk partitioning drivers that create a nonstandard
MS-DOS environment. However, for bus mastering disk controllers such as SCSI
drives, SMARTDrive provides double buffering of data that is important for
Windows operation.

Future Domain has tested this configuration extensively and supports running both
these drivers concurrently, as long as the device line for SMARTDrive comes
before LDRIVE.SYS in the CONFIG.SYS file. An alternative is to reformat and
partition the hard drive with the MS-DOS FDISK program if this configuration is
incompatible.

This information has been supplied by Future Domain and has not yet been fully
researched or tested by Microsoft. For more information, contact Future Domain
