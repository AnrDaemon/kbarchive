The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One way to determine the number of sectors per track and the sector
size is to reboot the machine and note what information SMARTDRV.SYS
displays on the screen. When it loads during the execution of the
CONFIG.SYS device drivers, it displays this information as it sets
itself up to mimic some of the disk's tracks and sectors in RAM.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.0 3.0a 3.00a winmem
