SYMPTOMS
========

If Windows has been configured for an 8514/a display driver, printing to a
printer across a Banyan Vines network causes a warning beep when the print job
finishes and then the computer stops responding (hangs).

RESOLUTION
==========

According to Banyan technical support, to avoid this problem you need to disable
the Banyan Vines message option as follows:

1. Log off from the Banyan Vines network.

2. Place the following line in the Banyan Vines start up batch file anywhere
   after the Login command:

   z:\setmsgs off

   If necessary, replace "z:\" with the path to the Setmsgs command.

3. Start Banyan Vines and log on before entering Windows.

NOTE: Another workaround to this problem is to configure Windows for the standard
VGA display.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the Setmsgs command set to ON (default), the Banyan Network tries to send a
message to line 25 on the display when a print job is finished. The print job
still prints and the network print message informs you that the print job is
finished; however, the machine locks up. Setting the "setmsgs off" disables this
message. The network does NOT notify the workstation when the job is complete.

reliability.
