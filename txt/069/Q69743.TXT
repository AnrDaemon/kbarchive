SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail for PC Networks NEWMAIL utility allows you to check the
postoffice for new mail. It tells you how many new mail messages and how many
unread mail messages you have.

To run the NEWMAIL utility, connect to the drive where the Mail executable files
are located (if you do not know, contact your network administrator). From the
MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER:

   "newmail <mailbox name>" (without the quotation marks)

The new mail information for the person with <mailbox name> will be
displayed on the screen. The NEWMAIL utility has no provision for passwords;
therefore, any user can run NEWMAIL on any other user's mailbox, including the
mailbox of the Mail administrator.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The above example assumes that the Mail database is located on drive M. If your
Mail database is located on a different drive, the line to invoke the NEWMAIL
utility should look like this:

   newmail -d<x> <mailbox name>

The -D parameter tells Newmail to look on drive X for the Mail database.

For more information about the NEWMAIL utility, see the following documentation:

 - Appendix D of the Microsoft Mail 2.1 "Administrator's Guide"

 - Appendix A of the Microsoft Mail 3.0 "Administrator's Guide"
