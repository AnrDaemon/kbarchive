OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server version 4.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install the Modem Sharing service in BackOffice Small Business
Server (SBS), you may be prompted to configure the TCP/IP properties or bind to
the correct Network Interface Card (NIC).

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if your computer contains two NICs that are the same make
and model or use the same chipset.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, install SBS when you have only one NIC installed in your
computer. If you need additional NICs, you can install them after you configure
the Modem Sharing service.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Backoffice Small Business Server
4.5.
