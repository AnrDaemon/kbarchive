STATUS

MORE INFORMATION
================


To install the hotfix, perform the following steps on the Systems Management
Server site server:

1. Replace the Pcmsvc32.exe file in the
   <SMS_root>\Site.srv\<Platform>.bin directory with the hotfixed
   version.

2. Reset the site. This is required for the updated file to be copied to all
   servers managed by the Site Configuration Manager. Windows NT Workstation
   computers running PCMSVC32 can be updated using RSERVICE.

3. Replace the Pcmwin16.exe file in the
   <SMS_root>\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\<Platform>.bin
   directory with the hotfixed version.

4. Replace the Pcmwin32.exe file in the
   <SMS_root>\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\<Platform>.bin
   directory with the hotfixed version.

5. Maintenance Manager will replicate the updated file to the Systems Management
   Server logon servers on its next work cycle. To update the clients running
   PCMWIN, either manually run Upgrade.bat on each client or follow the
   instructions in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
