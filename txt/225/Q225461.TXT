TITLE   :Outlook Contacts Are Not Accessible from Fax Send Utility on SBS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server version 4.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If Microsoft Outlook 2000 is installed on a computer running Microsoft
BackOffice Small Business Server, the Address Book button in the Compose New Fax
dialog box becomes available (normally, it is unavailable). When you click
Address Book, the program starts, however, Outlook contacts are not displayed in
the list.

Faxes sent from Outlook can use contacts and function normally. The problem
occurs only on the server and only when using the Fax Send utility or the Office
2000 "Send as Attachment" commands.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because of a design change in Outlook 2000. For non-Outlook
programs to use Outlook contacts, a special version of MAPI must be installed.
The Small Business Server-based computer has Microsoft Exchange Server
installed. Exchange Server installs its own version of MAPI. For performance
reasons, the Exchange Server version of MAPI is not replaced by the Outlook
version.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
