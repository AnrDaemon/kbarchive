When you try to open the Internet Services Manager (HTML), you may receive an
error message stating that the page cannot be displayed.

1. Start Internet Services Manager (Microsoft Management Console).

2. Double-click Internet Information Server, and then click the appropriate
   server name.

3. On the Action menu, click Properties.

4. Type "1024" (without the quotation marks) in the "Maximum network use" box,
   and then click Apply.

   Apply.

STATUS

MORE INFORMATION

Internet Services Manager (HTML) does not check the "Maximum network use" box
for a value between 1 and 32,768 when the box is left blank. These values are
checked when editing this option either by individual Web site (in the
ISM-HTML), or by server and Web site in the Internet Services Manager (Microsoft
Management Console).
