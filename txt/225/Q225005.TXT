SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to print from Microsoft Expedia Streets and Trips 2000 to a
Canon BJC-240, BJC-610, BJC-620, BJC-2000, or BJC-4550 printer, you may receive
the following error message:

   Runtime Error: Abnormal Program Termination

When you click Details, you receive the following error message:

   Autmap71.exe caused an invalid page fault in module Mfc42.dll.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if a Windows Printing System (WPS) compliant printer
driver for the Canon BJC-240, BJC-610, BJC-620, BJC-2000, or BJC-4550 printer is
installed on your computer.

NOTE: This behavior has also been reported with the Canon C2500 Multipass printer
driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, configure your printer driver to use raster printing, or
install a printer driver that supports raster printing.

To do this, use the appropriate method for your printer.

BJC-240 Printer
---------------

Contact Canon to obtain version 3.96 or later of the printer driver for your
Canon BJC-240 printer. This version of the printer driver includes raster
printing support.

BJC-610 and BJC-620 Printers
----------------------------

Contact Canon to obtain the raster printer driver for the BJC-610 and BJC-620
printers. Install this printer driver and use it when you print from Expedia
Streets and Trips 2000.

BJC-2000 Printer
----------------

Contact Canon to obtain version 6.31 or later of the printer driver for your
Canon BJC-2000 printer. This version of the printer driver includes raster
printing support.

BJC-4550 Printer
----------------

Contact Canon to inquire if a raster printer driver is available for the BJC-4500
series printers.

If a raster printer driver is not available, install either the Epson LQ-2550 or
the IBM Proprinter X24e printer driver and use this printer driver when you
print from Expedia Streets and Trips 2000.
