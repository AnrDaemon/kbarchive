   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you migrate data from a NetWare server to a Windows NT Server-based
computer, some folder permissions (including the file permissions in those
folders) may not be migrated.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when a folder name is longer than eight characters.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this behavior:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\NWRDR\Parameters

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value.

4. Add the following value:

   Value Name: LongNameFlags
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Data: 0x1 (hex)

NOTE: You can use the LongNameFlags value to enable or disable the long file name
support on the NetWare client. The default setting is enabled (0x0).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Migration tool for NetWare.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior does not occur with short folder names.
