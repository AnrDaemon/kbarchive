TITLE   :RPC Named Pipe Server App Encounters Invalid Handle Exceptions
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A program using the remote procedure call (RPC) named pipe server transport
encounters an excessive amount of invalid handle exceptions when attempting to
close a remote connection. The RPC program does not stop responding (hang)
because of the structured exception handling surrounding the RPC call, but may
affect performance and the logic of the server program.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Windows NT RPC Named Pipe Server transport is
inadvertently receiving an RPC fault over the network. This fault is reported as
an invalid handle because of a problem with identifying the client session.

RESOLUTION
==========
