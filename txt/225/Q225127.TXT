DOCUMENT:Q225127  18-NOV-2000  [winnt]
TITLE   :No Remote Access Functionality with Same User and Domain Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbCOMM

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click a user name in the Remote Access Server Administration tool, you
may receive the following error message:

   Error: 6 The handle is invalid

If the user attempts to dial in to a Remote Access server, the user may receive
the following error message:

   Error 649: The account does not have Remote Access permissions

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the user name is the same as the domain name. A
change was made to the Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 version of the Rassapi.dll
file that prevents a user with the same name as the domain from being validated
properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, do not create users with the same name as the
domain.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

Additional query words: RAS username domainname
