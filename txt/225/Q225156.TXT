TITLE   :Print Server Shows Incorrect Status Starting Large # of Printers
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,4.0SP1,4.0SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsna400sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When starting a large number of print sessions simultaneously on SNA Server,
status updates may not be reflected properly in SNA Manager, which may indicate
that printers are unavailable when in actuality they are functioning properly.

Event Viewer may also show the following event log:

   Event ID: 12 Source: SNA Print Server The Buffer pool for messages has become
   exhausted. Data may be lost.

Internal tracing may show the following:

   aimmain.c(1450)    AGFQH Free Queue is EMPTY!
   aimctrl.c(972)     AStus Status message lost
   aimctrl.c(1005)    AStus Leave, rc=5

CAUSE
=====

There is a limited queue of resources used internally to send Manager status
messages, and these are getting used up faster than they are being freed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2. This problem was first corrected in SNA Server version 4.0
Service Pack 3.
