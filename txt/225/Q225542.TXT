TITLE   :SMS: Logon Points Are Not Being Configured
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbtool kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you enable "Windows networking logon discovery" or "Windows networking
logon client installation" for a domain, Systems Management Server attempts to
configure all domain controllers for a given domain as Systems Management Server
logon points. If the primary domain controller (PDC) for the domain does not
meet the minimum requirements to perform the logon point role, no additional
logon points are installed for that domain.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To configure a domain controller as a logon point, the server must have an NTFS
partition with at least 50 megabytes (MB) of disk space available. To determine
if your site is experiencing this issue, look at the log file for
SMS_NT_LOGON_SERVER_MANAGER (NT_Logon.log) as logon points for the following
entries:

   Thread C7 has terminated exit code=0  	SMS_NT_LOGON_SERVER_MANAGER	4/7/99 11:20:15 AM	330 (0x14A)	
   Free space for \\PDC01\C$\ is 564 meg  	SMS_NT_LOGON_SERVER_MANAGER	4/7/99 11:20:15 AM	330 (0x14A)	
   Share C$ has 564 MB free, and does not support file and dir permissions  	SMS_NT_LOGON_SERVER_MANAGER	4/7/99 11:20:15 AM	330 (0x14A)	
   Unable to determine best volume  	SMS_NT_LOGON_SERVER_MANAGER	4/7/99 11:20:15 AM	330 (0x14A)	

When you review the Status Messages there are no messages indicating failure,
instead you see the following message that indicates the process cycle completed
successfully:

   SMS NT Logon Server Manager successfully completed a processing cycle for domain "<domain name>;".
