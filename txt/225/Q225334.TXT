======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, versions 2.0, 3.0, 3.5 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components versions 2.1, 2.5, 2.6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In some cases, when running queries from Microsoft Access or any application
that uses Jet/VBA, like Data Access Objects (DAO), that involve an ODBC
timestamp or SQL datetime data with the fractional portion of the timestamp
having a higher precision than milliseconds (3 digits), during updates you may
get an error message titled Write Conflict as follows:

   This record has been changed by another user since you started editing it. If
   you save the record, you will overwrite the changes the other user made.
   Copying the changes to clipboard will let you look at the values the other
   user entered, and then paste your changes back in if you decide to make the
   changes.

CAUSE
=====

Jet/VBA retrieves the timestamp data and converts it to a native format for
display. When the user tries to update such data, Jet/VBA has to convert the
data stored in native format to ODBC timestamp. In some cases during this
process the precision part of the fractional portion of the timestamp data may
be lost, and the backend may not be able to update the data successfully. When
this occurs you will receive the error.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem may occur with any applications using the Jet engine/VBA on their
clients.

Microsoft SQL Server uses a maximum of three digits (milliseconds) for the
fractional portion of the timestamp data, so the problem has not been observed
with respect to Microsoft SQL Server.

Additional query words: timestamp odbc datetime
