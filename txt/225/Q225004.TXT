-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Winsock 2.0 WSARecvFrom() function does not function and may
display the following error message when used in a User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
socket program:

   WSAEMSGSIZE - Error 10040

The WSARecvFrom function does not function when a buffer counter greater than one
is specified and the receiving datagram size exceeds 1,470 bytes.

The WSAEMSGSIZE error message may appear when the buffer size is not large enough
to accomodate the receiving datagram.

CAUSE
=====

If the datagram is fragmented, then the TCP driver does not fill the second
Memory Descriptor List (MDL) in the I/O Request packet chain.
