TITLE   :XCLN: CDO Search of GAL for CdoPR_MHS_COMMON_NAME is Slow
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When using CDO to find entries in a large Exchange Server global address list
(GAL) using the property CdoPR_MHS_COMMON_NAME, the operation can take a long
time to complete. The CdoPR_MHS_COMMON_NAME property is sometimes referred to as
the "alias" or "mailbox" name.

Consider the following Visual Basic code-fragment:
(Assume that the MAPI session is already established, and that NameToSearch
contains a string name).

   Dim objSession As MAPI.Session
   Dim objAddrEntFilt As MAPI.AddressEntryFilter
   Dim objAddressEntries As MAPI.AddressEntries
   Dim objAddressEntry As MAPI.AddressEntry

   Set objAddressEntries = objSession.AddressLists("Global Address List").AddressEntries
       
   objAddrEntFilt.Fields.Add (CdoPR_MHS_COMMON_NAME), NameToSearch
           
   Set objAddressEntry = objAddressEntries.GetFirst

The objAddressEntries.GetFirst method may take a long time to execute based on
the size of the global address list.

CAUSE
=====

With respect to the AddressEntryFilter object, the platform SDK currently
documents the following:

   For fields of data type String, the restriction type is RES_CONTENT with
   fuzzy level options FL_SUBSTRING, FL_IGNORECASE, and FL_LOOSE. However, the
   following MAPI properties are compared using FL_PREFIX instead of
   FL_SUBSTRING:

   PR_ACCOUNT
   PR_BUSINESS_ADDRESS_CITY
   PR_COMPANY_NAME
   PR_DEPARTMENT_NAME
   PR_DISPLAY_NAME
   PR_GIVEN_NAME
   PR_OFFICE_LOCATION
   PR_SURNAME
   PR_TITLE

Because CdoPR_MHS_COMMON_NAME (PR_MHS_COMMON_NAME) is not listed, a search
(restriction) using this MAPI property will result in a restriction type of
RES_CONTENT with the fuzzy level options FL_SUBSTRING, FL_IGNORECASE, and
FL_LOOSE. These fuzzy level options result in an inefficient (wildcard type of)
search mechanism, and it is recommended that searches for MAPI properties not
using FL_PREFIX be avoided.

RESOLUTION
==========

A modification was made to Cdo.dll to treat PR_MHS_COMMON_NAME as it does
PR_ACCOUNT (and the other MAPI properties listed above) which results in an
efficient FL_PREFIX search.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Cdo.dll

+------------------------+
| File name | Version    | 
+------------------------+
| Cdo.dll   | 5.5.2580.0 | 
+------------------------+


WORKAROUND
==========

Extended MAPI could be used instead of Cdo.dll providing more control for the
creation of restrictions.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.
