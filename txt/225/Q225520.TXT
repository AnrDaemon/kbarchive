KEYWORDS:kbsms200 smsinst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Systems Management Server Installer supports obtaining the current system date
and time by using the "Get System Information" script item. You can configure
the "Get System Information" script item to populate a variable with a string
representing the current system date and time. The string that is stored in the
target variable is formatted to conform to the short-date format as it is
specified in the Regional Settings too in Control Panel.

On Microsoft Windows NT-based computers, the user's default short-date format can
be different from the system locale's short-date format. Because Systems
Management Server Installer uses the system locale (not the user locale), the
string may not match the user's currently configured short-date format.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Users with administrative privileges on Windows NT-based computers can change
the system default locale in the Regional Settings tool in Control Panel. To
change the locale listed in the Regional Settings tool to the system default
locale, click to select the "Set as system default locale" check box before you
quit the Regional Settings tool in Control Panel.
