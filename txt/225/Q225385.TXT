TITLE   :New Intranet Kit Calendar Events Not Displayed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Server 4.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add an event to the Calendar component of the BackOffice 4.5 Intranet
kit, the event is successfully entered and accepted, but may not be displayed in
the View Events section of the Calendar page. This occurs whether you access the
page locally or over the network.

CAUSE
=====

Changing the time separator by using the Regional Settings tool in Control Panel
can cause new events not to be added to the Itranet kit calendar. Localizations
are not supported for this feature of the Intranet kit. To use the Events
calendar in BackOffice 4.5, you must change the time separator to the standard
colon separator (:).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Back Office Server 4.5.
