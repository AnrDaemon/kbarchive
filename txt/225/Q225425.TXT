OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word8 word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5 for Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send to a fax recipient from Microsoft Word (on the File menu, point to
Send To and then click Fax Recipient), after you click Send Fax Now, the fax is
not sent and the Check Names dialog box appears with the following error
message:

   No matches found for '[FAX:<faxnumber>]

   (No Matches Found)

CAUSE
=====

After you installed Microsoft Internet Explorer 5, Microsoft Outlook Express may
have been set as the default mail client, which provides simple MAPI services.
These simple MAPI services are incompatible when using Microsoft Fax and
Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, change the default mail client using the following
steps:

1. Start Internet Explorer 5.

2. On the Tools menu, click Internet Options.

3. Click to select the Programs tab.

4. Change the E-mail box to Microsoft Outlook.

5. Click OK.

NOTE: After you change the default mail client in Internet Explorer 5, you must
restart Word and re-send your document to the fax recipient.

For additional information about changing the default e-mail client, please see

MORE INFORMATION
================

After installing Microsoft Internet Explorer 5, when Microsoft Outlook Express
was first started, the following message was displayed:

   Outlook Express is not currently your default mail client. Would you like to
   make it your default mail client?

If you answered Yes, Microsoft Outlook Express was set as your default mail
client.
