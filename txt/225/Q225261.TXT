TITLE   :Error Line Number Returned By Snacfg.exe May Be Incorrect
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,4.0SP1,4.0SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsna400sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When using the offline administrative tool Snacfg.exe to import a script file
that contains more than 65,535 lines into a Com.cfg file, if an error occurs,
the line number displayed may be incorrect.

CAUSE
=====

The internal counter used by Snacfg.exe was defined as a short, limiting it to
65,535. This has been changed to a long value, which will allow the counter
value to be extended to 2,147,483,647.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server versions
4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2. This problem was first corrected in SNA Server version 4.0
Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to correcting the line number problem, a new /count parameter was
added to Snacfg so that the number of objects in a Com.cfg file can be counted
using the tool.


Also, performance enhancements were done at this time to improve the performance
of Snacfg.exe when parsing large configurations.
