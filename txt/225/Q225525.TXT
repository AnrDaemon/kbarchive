-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use the "net time" command, you may receive the following error
message:

   A required privilege is not held by the client.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you do not have permissions to alter time on a specific
computer. In User Manager, Change the System Time is a permission that can be
assigned to users. By default on a server, Administrators and Server Operators
have this permission. If this permission is granted to any other users or groups
on a domain controller, then when that user logs on to the domain, the user can
only change the time for domain controllers on that domain. On the workstation,
permissions are granted by default to Administrators and Power Users. If this
permission is granted to any other users or groups, then those users or groups
have the ability to change the system time only on that computer.
