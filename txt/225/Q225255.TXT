TITLE   :Some Share Names May Not Work Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Cluster Server 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use one of the following names as a share name, some API operations on
this share will fail:

   M, MA, MAI, MAIL, MAILS, MAILSL, MAILSLO, MAILSLOT

While MAILSLOT is a reserved name, the other share names are legal regardless of
case.

A known API call is FindFirstFile(). It may fail with an error 1 "Incorrect
function". Unfortunately, Microsoft Cluster Server uses this API call to verify
if the share name is alive.

CAUSE
=====

The share name was compared against the string "MAILSLOT" and found identical,
even if the share name was shorther than eight characters.

RESOLUTION
==========
