SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Windows 2000 with the German, Russian, or Hindi language, the
performance tuning slider for Web sites viewed in the HTMLA Web Administration
forms may show an incorrect number. The values for each of the three settings,
however, are still correct. The number shown below the slider is incorrect.

For example:

In English, the settings are as follows:

   Fewer than 10,000
   Fewer than 100,000
   More than 100,000

In German, the correct digit grouping symbol is a period, and should read as
follows:

   Fewer than 10.000
   Fewer than 100.000
   More than 100.000

In Russian, there is no digit grouping symbol, so there should just be a space,
as follows:

   Fewer than 10 000
   Fewer than 100 000
   More than 100 000

In Hindi, the symbol is still a comma, but you group the first three digits, and
then every two digits thereafter., as follows:

   Fewer than 10,000
   Fewer than 1,00,000
   More than 1,00,000

WORKAROUND
==========

The values for the positions of the performance slider bar are still the same.
Use this article as a reference for the correct values.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Services
5.0.
