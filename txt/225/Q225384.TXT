TITLE   :SBS: Fax Does Not Use Second Modem When the First One Is Busy
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0a,4.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbhw kbtool kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server versions 4.0, 4.0a, 4.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you have two or more compatible modems configured to use the Microsoft Fax
service and the first modem is in use by another service, other fax jobs may be
held until the first modem becomes available.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you install a modem and the Unimodem file that keeps
the corresponding Telephony API (TAPI) line open for monitoring is not
installed. Without this file, the second modem does not receive notification of
events on the corresponding line.

RESOLUTION
==========

Contact the manufacturer of your modem to obtain an updated firmware revision
and Unimodem driver files for use with Small Business Server (SBS). Reinstall
the modem with those files.

STATUS
======

This is a confirmed problem in SBS versions 4.0, 4.0a, and 4.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you reinstall a modem, you may encounter one or more of the issues
described in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:
