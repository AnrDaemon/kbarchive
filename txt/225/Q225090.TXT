SUMMARY
=======

When diagnostics logging is set to MAX for the MSExchangeIS Public object,
Replication category, the Application Event Log may contain the following error
which can be regarded as harmless.

   Event ID: 3093
   Source: MSExchangeIS Public
   Type: Error
   Category: Replication Errors
   Description:
   Error 0x8004010f reading property 0x67010003 on object type
   tbtOwningFolders.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by design. To be better able to track problems, the following
code was added to log ALL not found errors when the logging level is set to 5
(MAX) for source MSExchangeIS Public and category Replication:

   (0x8004010f) = ecNotFound-MAPI_E_NOT_FOUND

Most of these are harmless, and the code handles the not found error.

Additional query words: 3093 tbtOwningFolders 0x67010003 0x8004010f
