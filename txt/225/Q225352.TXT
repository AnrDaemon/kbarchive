TITLE   :Non-Computing Devices May Not Be Discovered by Network Discovery
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Network Discovery may not be able to discover non-computing devices such as UNIX
hosts and printers.

For these types of non-Windows devices, there is no method to obtain the IP
address. Without an IP address, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) cannot
talk to the device to verify its subnet mask (if Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol (DHCP) is not used).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Essentially, the IP address of these devices must be manually discovered. You
can add the IP address of a device you want to manually discover to the SNMP
Devices tab in Network Discovery properties.
