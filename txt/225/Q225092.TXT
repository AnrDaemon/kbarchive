SUMMARY
=======

It may seem easy to troubleshoot a node in a cluster by evicting the node and
reinstalling the cluster service. This process can be disastrous to the SQL
Virtual Machine and make you reinstall SQL 6.5 or 7.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Normally evicting a cluster node is not a problem. Reinstalling the cluster and
joining the other node typically replicates the proper entries. However, when an
SQL virtual machine is involved, it becomes complex.

Before you evict a Cluster Node running SQL, you must uninstall the SQL Virtual
Machine first. The process is to run the cluster Wizard for SQL Virtual machine
(not the SQL install) and uncluster SQL on both nodes. The path on the SQL
CD-ROMs are:

   SQL 6.5 = \i386\cluster
   SQL 7.0 = \x86\cluster

For Alpha computers, it would be in the Alpha folders.

Changing the name of the computer forces an eviction and has a similar effect
because after the computer name is changed, it does not communicate with the
other node.

The evict a node, follow these steps:

1. In Cluster Administrator, right-click the node name.

2. Click Evict Node.

NOTE: If you evict a node like this while running an SQL Virtual cluster, you
need to completely reinstall SQL.

Additional query words: MSCS SQL 6.5 7.0
