SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to change the quorum log size of a cluster.

MORE INFORMATION
================


The default quorum log size of any cluster is 64 kilobytes (KB). If you increase
the number of shares or transactions significantly, the quorum log size may be
too small.

You might need to adjust the quorum log size when you use a large number of file
shares. For example, an administrator adds new file shares that work properly,
and then a failover occurs. The file shares are no longer displayed in a
cluster.

You may receive an event message that indicates the quorum log size is too
small.

To change the quorum log size, follow these steps:

1. Right-click the top left cluster group name, and then click Properties.

2. Click quorum log, and then type "4096" (without the quotation marks) in the
   Size box.

NOTE: The size is atomic and you do not need to change the size on the other
node.

NOTE: You do not need to restart the computer or service unless you are running a
third-party tool, like a quota or virus protection program, that might prevent
the change from occurring.
