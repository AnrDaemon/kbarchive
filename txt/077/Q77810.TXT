SUMMARY
=======

When using Doskey, macros can be stacked on a command line by separating the
individual macros with the CTRL+T key combination. This combination allows the
macros to be executed sequentially. If a standard DOS command is placed between
the macros, the second macro will not be executed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using the following example:

   DOSKEY X=DIR C:\
   DOSKEY Y=DIR D:\

At the the command prompt, enter the following:

   " X ^T Y" (without the quotation marks)

(Where ^T is CTRL+T; the paragraph control character will appear on the line.)

The result of this will be a directory of the C: root followed by a directory of
the D: root.

At the command prompt, enter the following:

   " X ^T DIR ^T Y" (without the quotation marks)

The result of this will be a directory of the C: root, followed by a directory of
the current drive, followed by the error message "Bad Command or Filename."

Once the DOS command is executed, the DOSKEY macro is ignored. Thus, Y is assumed
to be a DOS command.
