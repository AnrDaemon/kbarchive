SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to create the FORTRAN run-time DLL (dynamic-linked
library) for OS/2 and how to create a user-written DLL for OS/2.

The following files are referenced in this article:

Filename      Description
--------      ------------

LLIBFMT.LIB   FORTRAN static, self-contained run-time library for
              multithread support.

OS2.LIB       Library to support OS/2 calls.

FDLLOBJS.LIB  Object files from FORTRAN run-time library used to
              create a dynamically linked FORTRAN run-time library.

FDLLOBJS.DEF  Definitions file containing entry points to the FORTRAN
              run-time library.

FRTEXE.OBJ    Startup code for FORTRAN run-time to be linked with all
              executables using FORTRAN DLLs.

FRTDLL.OBJ    Startup code for user-written FORTRAN DLL to be linked
              with all user DLLs.

FRTLIB.OBJ    Startup code for the FORTRAN run-time DLL, to be linked
              when creating FORTRAN run-time DLL.

* FRTLIB.DLL  Full FORTRAN run-time dynamic-linked library created by
              the user.

* FRTLIB.LIB  Resulting import library from full FORTRAN run-time
              library containing all FORTRAN run-time imports to the
              executable.

DIFFHLP.DEF   Support definitions file to create an import library
              for a dynamic-linked FORTRAN run-time library.

* Not shipped with FORTRAN, created by the user.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Creating the FORTRAN Run-Time DLL
---------------------------------

1. Create a definitions file listing all desired exports to the FORTRAN run-time
   library. For the full run-time library support, just use the file
   FDLLOBJS.DEF shipped with FORTRAN 5.1.

2. Create an imports library to correspond to the above definitions file. This
   can be done by using IMPLIB on the above definitions file. For the full
   run-time library support, just use the file FDLLOBJS.LIB shipped with FORTRAN
   5.1.

3. Create the FORTRAN run-time DLL (FRTLIB.DLL) by linking the above imports
   library with the DLL startup code (FRTLIB.OBJ), and the definitions file
   created in step 1. The following command line should be used to link the
   FORTRAN run-time DLL:

   link FRTLIB.OBJ,FRTLIBDLL,,FDLLOBJS.LIB/NOE,FDLLOBJS.DEF

4. Create the corresponding imports library to the FORTRAN run-time DLL
   (FRTLIB.LIB). This import library will contain references to the run-time
   external functions needed by the executable. The following command line
   should be used to create the import library:

   implib FRTLIB.LIB FDLLOBJS.DEF DIFFHLP.DEF

Creating a User-Written DLL to Be Linked to a Main Program
----------------------------------------------------------

The files referenced below are shipped with Microsoft FORTRAN version 5.10, see
the packing list for their exact locations.

1. Create a subroutine or function to be added to the user written
   dynamic-linked library. All functions that are available from the calling
   program need to have the [loadds] attribute on their definition. The file
   example for this is called FMTDLL.FOR.

2. Create a definitions file for the DLL containing exports into the DLL. The
   file example for this is FMTDLL.DEF.

3. Create a main program containing a call to the subroutine or function in the
   DLL. The program example for this is FMTMAIN.FOR.

4. Create a definitions file for the main program, containing imports to DLL
   routines. See FMTMAIN.DEF for an example of this file.

5. Produce the main program executable (FMTMAIN.EXE) by linking with the FORTRAN
   run-time DLL imports library (FRTLIB.LIB), the startup code for all DLL
   executables (FRTEXE.OBJ), and the main program's definition file
   (FMTMAIN.DEF). The following command line should used to compile the FORTRAN
   main program source code:

   fl /MD FMTMAIN.FOR FRTEXE.OBJ FRTLIB.LIB FMTMIN.DEF

6. Create the user-written DLL by linking its subroutines (FMTDLL.FOR) with its
   definitions file (FMTDLL.DEF), the startup code for all user-written FORTRAN
   DLLs (FRTDLL.OBJ), and the FORTRAN dynamic-linked run-time library
   (FRTLIB.LIB). The following command line should be used to compile the
   FORTRAN DLL source code:

   fl /MD /FeFMTDLL.DLL FMTDLL.FOR FRTDLL.OBJ FRTLIB.LIB FMTDLL.DEF

7. Put all DLLs in a directory within the OS/2 LIBPATH (FMTDLL.DLL, FRTLIB.DLL)
   and run the executable.
