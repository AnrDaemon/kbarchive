SUMMARY
=======

Generic Software has confirmed that running Generic CADD Level 3 Revision 4 from
MS-DOS version 5.0 Shell may result in missing or garbled characters when you
load or print drawings.

Generic Software does not recommend running Generic CADD with any other
memory-resident software or from MS-DOS Shell.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Generic Software recommends running Generic CADD directly from the command
prompt. Generic Software also recommends that no memory-resident software be
active when executing Generic CADD, including MS-DOS Shell.

Executing Generic CADD with memory resident software may result in incomplete
drawings or unnecessary characters when you load a file to print or view from
the screen.

Generic CADD requires 585K of conventional memory to run. To invoke Generic CADD
from the command prompt, type "cadd" (without the quotation marks) from the CADD
subdirectory.

independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
