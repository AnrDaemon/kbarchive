SUMMARY
=======

One common cause of the Setup error message

   An error occurred while reading or writing to Drive C:

when running Setup with the /F switch is that the system's hard disk is
partitioned but not formatted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the system's hard disk is formatted and partitioned, Setup /F will work
correctly. If the hard disk on the system is not partitioned, Setup /F will also
work.

However, if the hard disk is partitioned but not formatted, Setup /F will report
the "An error occurred while reading or writing to drive C:" error message. You
then have the option to "Try operation again" or "Fail the operation." In most
cases, if you fail the operation several times in a row, it will setup to floppy
disks anyway. If not, you must either format the hard disk or remove the
partitions.
