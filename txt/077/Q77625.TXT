PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.x
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

XIOS has confirmed that starting General Business Series or Professional Series
versions 3.3, 3.5.0, or 3.5.1 with MS-DOS version 5.0 may cause your system to
stop responding (hang or lock up).

CAUSE
=====

XIOS has stated that the file ISAM.EXE, which is executed upon starting these
applications, may conflict with MS-DOS 5.0 and cause the system to halt.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use the SETVER command to update the SETVER table as
follows:

1. Make sure the computer is booted with the SETVER.EXE utility. To confirm
   this, look for the following line in the CONFIG.SYS file:

   device=c:\dos\setver.exe

2. After the computer is booted, execute the following command at the hard drive
   (for example, drive C) command prompt:

   " setver isam.exe 3.30" (without the quotation marks)

A message regarding the program you are adding to the MS-DOS 5.0 version table
will be displayed. If the table is updated successfully, reboot the computer to
allow the change to take effect.
