SUMMARY
=======

Under certain circumstances, trying to trap GP (general protection) faults with
WDEB386 may produce unexpected results.

In general, if the processor generates a GP fault while a Windows-based
application is running, the GP-fault handler will automatically provide the
mechanism to stop at the offending instruction in WDEB386. However, unexpected
results (breaking at unusual locations, infinite loops, debugger crashes) may
occur under WDEB386 if one of the following conditions is true:

 - The GP fault occurs somewhere other than in a Windows-based application or
   dynamic-link library (DLL).

 - The WIN.INI file [kernel] section switch DisableGPTrapping is set to 1.
