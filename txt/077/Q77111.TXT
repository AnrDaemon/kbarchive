The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Included with the First Time Package that comes with the Toshiba T2000SX,
T2000SXe, and T3100SX computers is an addendum that details using the AutoResume
feature of the computer with Windows 3.0. This feature only applies to enhanced
mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The file BIOSXLAT.386 is a virtual mode device driver for Windows 3.0. Using
this device driver will allow the AutoResume feature of a Toshiba T3100SX or
T2000SX to function correctly while running Windows 3.0 in 386 enhanced mode.

This file does NOT support AutoResume in standard mode or real mode (that is
invoking "win /s" or "win /r").

Installation
------------

1. Copy the file BIOSXLAT.386 to the main Windows directory, (C:\WINDOWS by
   default).

2. Using a text editor, modify the Windows SYSTEM.INI file in the [386Enh]
   section as follows: Locate:

   device=*biosxlat

   Replace with:

   device=biosxlat.386

   Add a .386 extension and remove the asterisk.

NOTE: Windows now automatically loads the AutoResume driver. This allows the
AutoResume feature to function correctly when a normal power-off occurs while
you are in Windows and running in 386 enhanced mode.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.00a auto resume start
