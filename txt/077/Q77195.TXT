-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When running Windows Setup, you may find the text for the hardware descriptions
listing specific .DRV files or other nonstandard hardware descriptions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When running Windows Setup for the first time, the hardware descriptions are
read from the SETUP.INF file. The chosen configuration is then written to the
SYSTEM.INI's [boot.description] section. Thereafter, when running the Windows
Setup to make modifications to an existing installation of Windows, Windows
reads from the [boot.description] section of the SYSTEM.INI for the text
descriptions of the current configuration.

Possible causes for these changes include:

1. Modification of the SETUP.INF by you or by a third-party device driver
   installation

2. Modification of the SYSTEM.INI's [boot.description] section by you or by
   third-party device driver installation

3. OEM versions of SETUP.INF that do not have the standard description text

Note that there might be multiple SETUP.INF and/or SYSTEM.INI files on the
system. The Search command in the File menu in File Manager may help you locate
these files. If you are running Windows on a network, search both local and
network Windows directories.

Additional query words: 3.0 3.00 3.0a 3.00a 3.1 3.10 3.11
