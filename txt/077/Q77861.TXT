TITLE   :Control Panel's Sound Won't Play Certain Wave Files
PRODUCT :Miscellaneous Windows Products
PROD/VER::1.0

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you play certain .WAV files within the Control Panel's Sound option in
Windows version 3.0 with Windows Multimedia Extensions 1.0, the following error
message may be displayed:

   Unable to Play Sound

or the message may not appear and no sound is played.

In Windows version 3.1, the error message "Cannot Play the Selected Sound" is
displayed.

CAUSE
=====

The Sound option under Control Panel plays only 22.05 kHz .WAV files. It cannot
play 11.025 kHz .WAV files. However, Sound Recorder plays both 11.025 kHz and
22.05 kHz .WAV files, and saves in only 22.05 kHz format.

WORKAROUND
==========

To troubleshoot and resolve this error, do the following:

1. Ensure that the sound functions are working by playing a sound from the
   MMDATA subdirectory. If this does not work, then there are driver/hardware
   problems.

2. Load the .WAV file that won't work under Control Panel into the Sound
   Recorder. Then use Sound Recorder to save the .WAV file in 22.05 kHz so that
   Control Panel's Sound option can work with the .WAV file.

3. Try adjusting the sound a little in Sound Recorder. Increase or decrease the
   volume once and save the file. Now try playing the file in Control Panel's
   Sound option.
