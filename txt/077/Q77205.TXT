-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have an 84-key keyboard with the Toshiba 5100, using the SHIFT key with
the UP or DOWN ARROW keys may not work properly with the MS-DOS version 5.x and
versions 6.0 and later utilities.

CAUSE
=====

In MS-DOS Shell, Qbasic, or Edit, pressing the SHIFT+UP/DOWN ARROW key
combinations for text or file selection does not work correctly with an
incorrect CMOS setup.

The Toshiba 5100 CMOS setup contains options for an 84 or 101-key keyboard. The
SHIFT+UP/DOWN ARROW key combinations do not operate properly if the setup is
configured for an 84-key keyboard.

The Toshiba CMOS setup option for 84-key keyboard selection disables the 17 page
editing keys. This prevents the UP/DOWN ARROW keys from working in conjunction
with the SHIFT key.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the problem, change the system CMOS setup from an 84-key keyboard to
a 101-key keyboard, as follows:

1. Insert the Toshiba Setup disk in drive A.

2. At the A prompt, type "TEST3" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER.

3. Enter 0 (zero) for the Setup option.

4. Select the Keyboard option.

5. Change the 84-key keyboard to the 101-key keyboard.

6. Press F10 to save your changes and exit Setup.
