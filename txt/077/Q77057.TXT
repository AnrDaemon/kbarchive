SUMMARY
=======

When running more than one application at a time, you may find that your
system's keyboard response is slower. To alleviate this, you can adjust the
amount of time allocated to processing keystrokes when running Windows 3.0 in
386 enhanced mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To increase the priority of the foreground application's scanning of the
keyboard, add the KeyBoostTime= setting to the [386Enh] section of the
SYSTEM.INI file. You can do this with a text editor such as Notepad.

The KeyBoostTime default setting is:

        KeyBoostTime=.001

When you set up your system, this line is not automatically added to the [386Enh]
in this section and you must add it. If you need to change this setting, start
with

        KeyBoostTime=.005

Increase the setting in small increments until you achieve the desired response.

NOTE: When Windows runs multiple programs, it divides the processor's time among
them. The amount of time each application receives depends upon the foreground
and background priority settings for each application. As you increase the
number of background applications, the foreground application receives less and
less time to process keystrokes.
