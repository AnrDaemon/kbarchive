======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The value given in Setup inside of Windows 3.0 may report the existence of a
permanent swap file even if the file is corrupted or Microsoft Windows is not
using the swap file.

CAUSE
=====

Setup searches for the first 386SPART.PAR file on the local hard disk. If Setup
finds 386SPART.PAR on drive C, it includes the file in the listing as the
Windows permanent swap file even if Windows is actually using a different
permanent swap file on drive D. It is possible to have more than one swap file
on a computer if the other swap files are located on other logical drives.

WORKAROUND
==========

To find the value for the swap file, subtract the amount of RAM that the
computer has from the value reported when you choose About Program Manager from
the Help menu in Program Manager.
