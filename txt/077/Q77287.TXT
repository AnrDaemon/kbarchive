SUMMARY
=======

GlbEdit.exe is a sample file in that demonstrates how an edit control can have
its own data segment. By default, the buffer for an edit controls is allocated
from the application's data segment. Because the data segment is also used to
store information for other controls, space in the data segment is a scarce
resource.

Normally, edit controls in a dialog box use one common global data segment per
dialog box. If the dialog box has style DS_LOCALEDIT, edit controls use the data
segment pointed to by the hInstance used to create the dialog box. Edit controls
created with CreateWindow() use the data segment pointed to by hInstance.

The GLBEDIT sample shows how to change hInstance to point to a new global object.
Multiple controls of any type can use the same memory object.

To find the effected portions of the code, search for WM_CREATE in the
MainWndProc.
