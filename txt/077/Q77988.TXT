SUMMARY
=======

The Setup program for Bookshelf for Windows will disable the OK button four
characters after the backslash following a directory name containing an
extension. The following install path will cause this problem:

   c:\mswork.dir\subdir

Once four more characters are typed after ".dir\" (without the quotation marks)
in this example, the OK button will be unavailable (dimmed). The only solution
to this problem is to enter a path, which does not exceed four characters, after
a directory name with an extension, or to enter a path that does not contain
directory names with extensions.
