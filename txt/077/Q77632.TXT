TITLE   :Trailing Spaces in SET TEMP Returns Error in MS-DOS Shell
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when you try to invoke an executable
file from MS-DOS Shell:

   BAD COMMAND OR FILENAME

SHIFT+F9 works properly, but program items, the Run command on the File menu, and
choosing an executable from the file list do not work.

CAUSE
=====

These symptoms occur if the SET TEMP= statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file
contains one or more trailing blank spaces as the last character(s). For
example, in the statement

   set temp=c:\tempdir

any blank space(s) after the letter "r" in "tempdir" cause the above error. This
error occurs if the TEMP variable containing the trailing space is set to any
directory other than the root.

The error message is displayed if an executable file is invoked by any of the
following methods:

 - Pressing ENTER or double-clicking a program listed in the program list of the
   Main group.

 - Pressing ENTER or double-clicking the executable filename under the file
   list.

 - Choosing Run from the File menu and entering the executable file name on the
   command line.

WORKAROUND
==========

To determine if this is the problem, exit Shell, and enter the following command
at the MS-DOS command prompt:

   set temp=c:\ 

This command sets the temporary directory to the root. Start Shell, then invoke
the executable file by using one of the above methods.

If this corrects the problem, remove any trailing blanks on the SET TEMP= line in
the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
