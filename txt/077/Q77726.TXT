-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

No clock-alarm or error-message sounds are heard when starting up Windows with
Multimedia Extensions.

CAUSE
=====

The Warning Beep check box must be selected from Control Panel's Sounds icon. If
Warning Beep is not selected, the special event sounds are not active.

WORKAROUND
==========

Select the Sounds icon from Control Panel, and select the Warning Beep check
box.

If you are using Windows version 3.0 or 3.0a with Multimedia Extensions version
1.0, you must reinitialize the WIN.INI file after the change. (In other words,
after you have selected or cleared the check box, you must exit and then restart
Windows for the changes to take effect.)

Later versions of Windows have an option to restart Windows without exiting.
