SUMMARY
=======

Executing Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3 with MS-DOS 5.0 may cause any of the following
problems:

 - computer lock up when loading 1-2-3

 - keyboard lock up

 - having to press a key several times to get a response

 - beeping when pressing a key

 - typing a character and having a different character displayed

The following error message may also be encountered:

   UNEXPECTED INTERRUPT

Lotus provides a series of SET DOS16M environment commands to be used in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file to resolve these problems.

This information applies to Microsoft MS-DOS version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

These errors may occur if using a nonstandard technique for switching from
protected mode to real mode.

The Lotus series of SET DOS16M commands are specific to certain computer
configurations and may eliminate these errors. These commands, as stated below,
can be entered in at the MS-DOS prompt for testing before starting Lotus 1-2-3
Release 3. Reboot the computer after trying each different command. After
finding the one that works, add it to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

Command            Application
-------            -----------
SET DOS16M=10      Use these commands for 80286 machines
SET DOS16M=10,750  using the "fast" method of switching
                   from protected to real mode.

SET DOS16M=9       Use these commands for 80286 machines
SET DOS16M=9,750   using the "standard" method of
                   switching from protected to real mode.

SET DOS16M=13      Use for AST Research 80286 machines
                   with older keyboard ROM chips.

SET DOS16M=7       Use for machines with older Phoenix
                   Technologies ROM chips.

SET DOS16M=6       Use for some AT&T PC 6300 series machine.

SET DOS16M=2       Use for IBM PS/2 80286 machines.

SET DOS16M=3       Use for some 80386 computers without VCPI
                   drivers.

If none of the above commands solve the problem, Lotus has a utility, available
at no cost, called CHK1-2-3 that will identify the hardware in the system and
suggest changes that will help run Release 3. CHK1-2-3 can be obtained from a
local Lotus authorized reseller, a Lotus sales representative, or a Lotus
authorized training center.
