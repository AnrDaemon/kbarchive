Under Microsoft Windows enhanced mode, a virtual device (VxD) can use the virtual
keyboard device (VKD) and virtual display device (VDD) message mode services to
provide user interaction. These services are especially useful to programs that
implement security systems where the user is required to enter a password before
any further operation can proceed.

REFERENCES
==========

The VKD and VDD message mode services are documented in the Microsoft Windows
Device Driver Kit "Virtual Device Adaptation Guide."
