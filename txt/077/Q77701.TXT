SUMMARY
=======

The VERINFO utility provides version information about many of the drivers,
dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), and executable files provided with Microsoft
Multimedia Windows. VERINFO in installed in the main Multimedia Windows
directory (by default, C:\MMWIN).

MORE INFORMATION
================

After VERINFO is running, double-click the name of a file to view the file's
version information. VERINFO then provides a drop-down list box and prompts for
specific information. By default, VERINFO gives the version number.

For example, if the user requests information about the MMSYSTEM.DLL file,
VERINFO provides a series of bits in the Value edit control, as follows:

   0001 0000 0000 0096

This number represents version 1 of the software, build 96 (beta). This
information varies depending on the build of the software that is installed.

This information can be useful to determine whether a particular driver requires
updating. It is also useful to verify that all portions of the product are from
the same release.
