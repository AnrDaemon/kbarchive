The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

Norton Speed Disk versions 6.0 and 6.01 run optimally with MS-DOS version 5.0.
However, Symantec states that using Norton Speed Disk with MS-DOS SMARTDrive
cache loaded may cause corruption to the FAT (file allocation table).
Apparently, SMARTDrive cannot keep up with the read-write activity of Speed
Disk.

Norton Speed Disk versions 6.0 and 6.01 are the only Speed Disk versions that are
fully compatible with MS-DOS version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Speed Disk reorganizes the physical layout of all files and directories on a
disk so as to minimize movement of the read-write head. It defragments files and
puts all of the unused disk space on the inner tracks of the hard disk.

Speed Disk has a number of different optimization methods including variances of
a full optimization, unfragmenting files only, and unfragmenting free space
only. No matter which Speed Disk method you use, don't use SMARTDrive
simultaneously. Symantec states that their caching utility, NCACHE, is fully
compatible with Speed Disk.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
or reliability.
