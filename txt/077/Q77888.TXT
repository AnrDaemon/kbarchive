MORE INFORMATION
================

Bitstream Facelift is a screen/printer font package designed to work with
WordPerfect versions 5.0 and 5.1.

When Facelift is executed through Shell with the Task Swapper active, it will
work properly. When the program is swapped from memory to disk the monitor
blanks and the system hangs.

To adjust the Facelift advanced options, do the following:

1. Use the FLSETUP.EXE program that comes with the Facelift package. It will be
   in the Facelift directory or on Facelift Utility Disk 1.

2. From the disk or directory containing the file FLSETUP.EXE, type the
   following command:

   " flsetup /a" (without the quotation marks)

   This will execute the Advanced Installation Options for Facelift.

3. The following is a list of Options/Settings that will work correctly with
   Shell:

   Field                              Setting
