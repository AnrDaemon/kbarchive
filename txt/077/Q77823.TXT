======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS, versions 5.1, 5.11, 5.13, 5.15 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to link an application fails and Microsoft LINK generates the
following message:

   LINK : error L2049: no segments defined

CAUSE
=====

The linker command line contains the /HIGH option switch. The error occurs
because the linker checks for an empty .EXE file incorrectly.

RESOLUTION
==========

LINK produces the .EXE file correctly. You can ignore the error message when the
command line includes the /HIGH option.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in LINK versions 5.1, 5.11, 5.13,
and 5.15 for MS-DOS. This problem was corrected in LINK version 5.2 for MS-DOS.
LINK version 5.2 generates an L4076 warning message in place of the L2049 error
message.

Additional query words: 5.10 5.11 5.13 5.15
