The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Pages 451 and 459 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version 3.0
incorrectly state that when creating a program information file (PIF) and
leaving the Window Title text box blank, the icon title, when minimized, will
contain the application's filename without the extension.

This information does not apply to later versions of Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you leave the Window Title text box blank while in real, standard, or 386
enhanced mode, the icon title does not assume the application's filename without
the extension. Rather, the icon title assumes the name of the application's PIF
without the .PIF extension.

Note: This also holds true for the title that appears in the Task List when you
press CTRL+ESC. While the manual is incorrect, the on-screen Help program that
appears when you place the cursor in the Window Title text box and press F1
correctly states that the title bar will display the name of the PIF without the
.PIF extension.
