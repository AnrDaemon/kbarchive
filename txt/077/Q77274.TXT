======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the No Page Break option for the IBM Proprinter is unavailable (dimmed), then
the "feed=" line in the [PROPRINTERdrv] section of the WIN.INI file is greater
than zero.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Change this line so it reads (this can be any number greater than zero):

   feed=0

2. Save the WIN.INI file.

3. To make your changes take effect, exit and restart Windows.

4. Open the Control Panel and select the Printers icon. Choose Configure and
   then Setup. Look at the Page Break option. This time it will be available
   (not dimmed).

NOTE: This problem also occurs with the Epson 9-pin printer drivers, and should
be corrected in the same fashion.
