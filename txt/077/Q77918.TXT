The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience erratic mouse behavior in Microsoft Windows versions 3.0,
3.0a, and 3.1 running on an ALR Business Veisa Machine using the Microsoft Mouse
version 7.04 driver with a CMOS memory setting of "Infinity".

CAUSE
=====

The ALR Business Veisa Machine has two memory settings: Infinity or 16 MB. If
the memory is set for Infinity, it causes erratic mouse behavior with the
Microsoft serial mouse driver version 7.04. This unstable behavior occurs in
real, standard, and enhanced modes of Windows.

RESOLUTION
==========

To solve this problem, run CMOS, go to the second page option, and choose the 16
MB memory option.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You should verify any CMOS setting procedures with the documentation that comes
with the computer, or contact ALR technical support for further details.
