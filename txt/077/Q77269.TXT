======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your system has a Plus Development Passport hard drive as the second physical
hard drive, the MS-DOS 5.0 and later Setup program may stop responding (hang) or
give disk errors when setup is 99 percent complete.

WORKAROUND
==========

According to Plus technical support, to successfully install MS-DOS, you must
remove the Passport driver (PLUSDRV.SYS) from CONFIG.SYS, reboot the system,
then run the MS-DOS Setup program. This makes the Passport drive invisible to
Setup. After Setup is complete, place PLUSDRV.SYS back in the CONFIG.SYS file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: Because the Passport hard drive is removable, it is usually the second
hard drive.
