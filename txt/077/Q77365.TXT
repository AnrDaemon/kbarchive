SUMMARY
=======

The Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) documentation regarding dynamic-link
libraries (DLLs) is not very detailed with regard to some facets of developing
DLLs. In this article, some of the lesser known considerations for developing
DLLs are discussed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The primary reason for using a DATA NONE DLL is to ensure that the data segment
(DS) is equal to the stack segment (SS). Many of the functions provided with the
Microsoft C run-time libraries expect that DS == SS. Functions with this
property have been removed from the Windows SDK DLL libraries. In DATA SINGLE
DLLs, the DLL will use the application's SS, but the DLL will have its own DS.
DS is then not equal to SS and the C run-time functions (or other functions
expecting DS == SS) may not be used. In DATA NONE DLLs, however, the DLL uses
the application's DS and SS. In applications, DS == SS; therefore, for a DATA
NONE DLL, DS == SS.

While this may sound like a straightforward process, there are some items
declared within a DLL that can create a data segment. Windows looks at a flag to
determine if the DLL has a data segment. If DATA NONE has been declared, Windows
will treat that DLL as a DATA NONE DLL whether a data segment exists or not.
However, the Windows loader uses information from the linker to determine what
segments to load, not how the flags are set. Therefore, data segments that do
exist are loaded into memory.

When additional data segments are created, because the compiler works under the
assumption that DS == SS, the data segments that are loaded are not used and
waste memory.

When a DATA NONE DLL does have a data segment, Windows will use the application's
DS as it should, but the offset into the data segment is the offset into the
DLL's data segment. Writing to any variable declared in the DLL will overwrite
data in the application's data segment.

This type of bug is often difficult to track down. When the data segment is built
for the DLL, items are placed in the data segment from bottom to top. So an
integer variable will take up 2 bytes on the bottom of the DLL's data segment.
Writing to this variable will overwrite 2 bytes at the bottom of the calling
application's data segment. An application's data segment normally contains
thousands of bytes; therefore, this type of error may go unnoticed and will not
cause a GP-fault.

Global variables, static variables, and static text (string literals such as
"Hello") declared in the DLL will create new data segments for the DATA NONE
DLL.

The warning message "RC: Warning RW4002: Non-discardable Segment 2 set to
PRELOAD" is quite common when DLLs are processed by the Resource Compiler.
However, it is not immediately obvious from the text of the message why this is
a problem. This warning is generated when a data segment has been created but
flags have not been defined for that segment (such as NONE, PRELOAD, or SINGLE).
The default setting for these segments is PRELOAD SINGLE.

After ruling out all the obvious ways that a new data segment can be created, it
is time to look deeper into the heart of the code.

If the DLL uses the Microsoft C run-time code, a global internal variable is used
by the library. This variable is referenced in LIBENTRY.ASM by the following
code:

      extern __acrtused:abs

The __acrtused variable informs the linker that the C run-time code will be used
in the DLL. If the C run-time code is not used in the DLL, this variable may be
removed to create a true DATA NONE DLL. This is done by replacing the C run-time
libraries (SDLLCEW, MDLLCEW, and LDLLCEW) with the appropriate libraries without
the C run-time code (SNOCRTD, MNOCRTD, and LNOCRTD, respectively). Along with
these libraries, the /NOE option must also be used. For more information on
eliminating the C Run-time startup code, refer to Section 14.5.10.1 in the
"Guide to Programming" manual of the Windows Software Development Kit version
3.1.

If the C run-time is used by the DLL, this variable must be declared and using
the DATA SINGLE declaration is encouraged. Declaring __acrtused creates a data
segment. However, the warning that occurs when this is done in a DATA NONE DLL
may often be ignored.

DATA SINGLE is also encouraged when the DLL contains literal strings.
