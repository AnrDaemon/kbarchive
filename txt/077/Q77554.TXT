SUMMARY
=======

Text copied from an MS-DOS application running in a window under Windows 3.0 to
the Clipboard will have a carriage return added to it, if one does not already
exist.

Some Windows applications such as Word for Windows, Write, and Notepad show this
added carriage return when this text is pasted. The insertion point of the
Windows application begins on a new line after the pasted text.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a carriage return is copied from the MS-DOS application, then a carriage
return is not appended to the existing carriage return copied with the text to
the Clipboard.

It is possible to save the Clipboard file and then view the file's contents with
a sector or disk editing utility and see the added carriage return. A carriage
return is represented by the value "0D."

When a Windows application such as Write or Notepad has text copied to the
Clipboard, this does not occur.
