SUMMARY
=======

According to Orchid, the PC Turbo 286 E board is not compatible with MS-DOS 5.0.
The software that accompanies the board allows you to use the computer's default
mode or turbo mode. The default mode usually runs the computer as an 8086 or
8088 processor. In turbo mode, the software runs the machine as an 80286
processor.

If you enter turbo mode under MS-DOS 5.0, the machine will hang.
