TITLE   :BUG: LinkTimeOut of -1 Waits Only 6553.5 Secs Before Time Out
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::1.0,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Contrary to the documentation and online Help for Microsoft Visual Basic,
setting the LinkTimeOut property of a control to -1 will not cause the control
to wait forever for a DDE operation to complete. Setting the LinkTimeOut
property to -1 will cause the control to wait for 65535 intervals of 1/10
second, for a total of approximately 1 hour and 49 minutes.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you can trap the DDE time-out error using the On
Error statement in Visual Basic. If the error was "Timeout while waiting for DDE
response," you can retry the DDE operation until it succeeds. The following is a
code example:

      Sub DDE_Retry_Forever (Source as Control, commandx$)
         On Local Error Goto Handler

         Source.LinkExecute commandx$
         Exit Sub

         Handler:
         If Err = 286 Then
            Resume
         Else
            Error Err
         End If
      End Sub

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
