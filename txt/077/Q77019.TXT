SUMMARY
=======

The OK button in the dialog box where you are prompted for an installation path
in the Setup program for Bookshelf for Windows can be unavailable (dimmed) for
the following reasons:

1. An invalid character has been included in the path string. The program checks
   each character to see if it violates path string rules as you type. Such
   violations include:
   a. No backslashes to separate drives or directories. (A path of D:VIEWER or
      C:\WINDOWSVIEWER makes the button unavailable.)

   b. No colon to specify a drive.

   c. A directory name in the path longer than the maximum number of characters
      allowed in a normal DOS directory name.

2. The path is more than 32 characters. 32 is the limit by design.
