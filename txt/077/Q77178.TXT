The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a Tangent machine with a Mylex 80486 EISA motherboard, you may
experience erratic behavior when using Microsoft MS-DOS version 5.0 or 6.0,
especially when using the Mylex DCE cache controller.

Symptoms include the following:

 - Machine stops responding (hangs).

 - You can't access directories.

 - You can't access the hard drive.

 - Your file allocation table (FAT) may be corrupt.

The following application-specific problems have also been experienced with this
configuration:

 - With MS-DOS 5.0 or 6.0 and Windows 3.0, erratic inability to find COMMAND.COM
   when exiting Windows.

 - With Edit, QBasic, and 101-key keyboards, dedicated cursor keys operate as if
   the SHIFT key has been pressed (that is, they select blocks rather than
   moving the cursor).

 - With EMM386.EXE, when attempting to use CTRL+ALT++ or CTRL+ALT+- to change
   the processor speed, an

   ILLEGAL INSTRUCTION : SYSTEM HALTED

   error occurs. The only way to recover from this error is with a cold boot.

 - When running Memmaker from MS-DOS 6.0, the following error message is
   displayed:

   Illegal Instruction Trapped
