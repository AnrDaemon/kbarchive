The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The automatic A20 handler detection scheme employed by HIMEM.SYS in MS-DOS may
not install the proper A20 handler on SAMSUNG S-5200 computers.

CAUSE
=====

On SAMSUMG S-5200 laptop computers, HIMEM.SYS may install A20 handler number 1.
This may result in erratic behavior on the machine when extended memory is
accessed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, the A20 handler number 12 should be installed. Add the
following line to the CONFIG.SYS file to install the proper handler:

   device=c:\dos\himem.sys /machine:12
