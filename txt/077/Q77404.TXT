TITLE   :PRB: SETUP.EXE Fails to Replace OEM Drivers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Device Driver Kit
PROD/VER::3.0,3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Device Development Kit (DDK) for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When SETUP.EXE is used to replace a device driver specified in the OEMSETUP.INF
file, the driver is not replaced.

CAUSE
=====

When SETUP.EXE finds that a file of a specified name already exists on the
target machine, it assumes that the driver is already installed and only updates
the .INI file.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two ways to work around this problem:

1. Change the name of the driver to reflect the newer version

2. Write a program that runs prior to SETUP.EXE that deletes older versions of
   the driver files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The first resolution option is superior because version information is stored in
the filename. The date stamp is subject to corruption by the inadvertent use of
a "touch" program.

For example, version 1.0 of a custom VGA driver might be released as follows:

   MYVGA.DRV 72816 11-09-90 12:00a

When the driver is updated, version 1.2 might be released as follows:

   MYVGA_2.DRV 111512 04-07-91 03:00a

This technique avoids the Setup constraint, and also eases the burden of
identifying the installed driver for troubleshooting purposes.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.10
