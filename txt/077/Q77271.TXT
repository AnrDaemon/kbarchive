 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

On IBM 286-based PS/2s, the Windows Setup program removes the device driver
XMA2EMS.SYS line from the CONFIG.SYS file. Running Windows Setup and allowing
Setup to modify the CONFIG.SYS file deletes this line. To provide expanded
memory to MS-DOS applications outside of Windows, you must reinsert the
XMA2EMS.SYS line using a text editor.

NOTE: XMA2EMS.SYS is incompatible with Windows versions 3.0 and 3.1, and was
removed during Setup. The only way to use expanded memory with Windows is to
install an expanded memory board and load the provided drivers for that board
into the CONFIG.SYS file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To reinsert the expanded memory driver, do the following:

1. Locate the file C:\CONFIG.OLD, which is an exact copy of your CONFIG.SYS file
   before Windows changed it.

2. Place into your current CONFIG.SYS a line similar to the following: (include
   the correct drive and path syntax originally used)

         DEVICE=C:\XMA2EMS.SYS

Now non-Windows applications can access expanded memory outside of Windows.
