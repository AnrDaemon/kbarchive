The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you run Windows 3.0 on a Microsoft LAN Manager 2.0 Enhanced (or 100 percent
compatible) network, NETLOGON.PRO does not load correctly from within the
Windows Control Panel when you use the LANMAN.DRV file that is shipped with
Windows 3.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you log onto the network from within Windows Control Panel by selecting the
Network icon and using the Windows 3.0 LANMAN.DRV file, the following may
happen:

1. The profile doesn't execute.

2. The profile doesn't execute, flips to a full-screen window, and displays the
   following error message:

   Invalid Drive Specification

These problems do not occur if you use the Net Logon command before starting
Windows or if you use version 3.01 of the LANMAN.DRV, which is shipped with the
MS-DOS LAN Manager version 2.0. The file is located on the 3.5-inch Workstation2
disk or the 5.25-inch Workstation3 disk, under the subdirectory NETPROG. To
install this driver, do the following:

1. Switch to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory.

2. Rename the LANMAN.DRV using the proper DOS syntax.

3. Switch to the floppy disk drive where the new LANMAN.DRV is located and copy
   it into the WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory.

Additional query words: 2.0 3.01 3.00 lanman win30
