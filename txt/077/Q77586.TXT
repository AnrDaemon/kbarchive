TITLE   :PRB: Custom Command-Line Options Disappear
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbide kbVC kbprb

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Visual Workbench Integrated Debugger, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.51, 1.52 
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Compiler, linker, and resource compiler command line options may disappear from
the custom options fields. If you specify custom options, close the dialog box,
and open it again, the specified options may not appear in the list of
additional options.

CAUSE
=====

Specified options that disappear from the custom option fields were reset by
entries in other option fields. For example, if you specify "/W1" (without
quotation marks) in the custom option field, close the dialog box, and reopen
it, the "/W1" option does not appear in the custom options field. However, the
Warning Level combo box displays Level 1, as specified.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is not a problem in Visual C++ 2.0 and later, because of changes to the
development environment.

Additional query words: 1.00 1.10 1.50 arguments
