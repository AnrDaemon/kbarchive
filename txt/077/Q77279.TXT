SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Windows Paintbrush program's Use Printer Resolution function
allows you to size and control printed output. When Use Printer Resolution is
selected, Paintbrush translates one screen pixel to one printer pixel.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use the Printer Resolution in printing graphics from Windows Paintbrush, use
the following procedure:

1. Confirm the graphics resolution setting for the default printer.

   For example:

   A Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet II has three graphic resolution: 75, 150, and
   300 dpi.

   To do this, select the Printers icon from the Control Panel, highlight the
   default printer from the installed printers list, and choose Configure and
   Setup.

2. Multiply the horizontal and vertical printer graphical resolutions (pels) by
   the horizontal and vertical dimensions (in inches) of the desired output.

   For example:

   Suppose an output size of 7-by-10 inches is desired at printer resolution. If
   the printer is currently set to 300 x 300 resolution, then set the Image
   Attributes as follows:

   Width: 7 x 300 = 2100 Pels
   Height: 10 x 300 = 3000 Pels

3. Enter the results from step 2 in Paintbrush's Image Attributes box located
   under the Options menu. Enter the information as Pels.

4. From the File menu, choose New to create a new work area. You need to use
   Scroll bars to view the entire image.

5. Check the current margins in Paintbrush by choosing Page Setup from the File
   menu. Make sure the margins can accommodate the desired output size.

6. When preparing to print the image, make sure the Use Printer Resolution box
   is selected and Scaling is set to 100 0n the Print dialog box.
