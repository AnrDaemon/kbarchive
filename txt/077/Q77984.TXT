TITLE   :Which MS-DOS Version Should I Boot to Run MS-DOS Setup?
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.x,6.0,6.2,6.21,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When upgrading to MS-DOS 5.0 or later on a hard drive, the Microsoft MS-DOS
Upgrade SETUP.EXE program should be run in the version of MS-DOS that is
currently installed on the machine. Booting the machine with another version of
MS-DOS may cause improper access of the hard drive, leading to file corruption.
Additionally, SETUP may make incorrect assumptions about which OEM-modified
utilities to preserve.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are reinstalling MS-DOS 5 or later, you do not need to reinstall your
previous MS-DOS version before running SETUP.

If the hard drive has MS-DOS 2.1 or earlier installed, contact your OEM (original
equipment manufacturer) as to the availability of a version of their MS-DOS 5.0
or later for your machine. If you have version 2.11 or later, you can boot with
this version and install MS-DOS 5.0 or later to floppy disks using the SETUP /F
command. MS-DOS 5.0 or later can then be installed manually from this working
set of disks. However, this may require reformatting the hard disk, depending on
the partition structure currently in use.

If installing MS-DOS version 5.0 or later (not MS-DOS Upgrade), boot from disk 1
to install MS-DOS. The original equipment manufacturer (OEM) version of MS-DOS
has a different Setup program that requires MS-DOS to be booted before
installing it.
