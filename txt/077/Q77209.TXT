The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can run the DOSSHELL.INI file from a network drive so that each user can
have his or her own DOSSHELL.INI. To do so, the user must have the following
line in his or her AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   set dosshell=[drive letter]:[user directory]

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DOSSHELL.INI file must be copied from the local DOS directory into the
network drive's directory that was referenced by the above command after SET
DOSSHELL is added to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

Check to make sure that the VIDEODIR=[DRIVE:] [PATH] line within the DOSSHELL.INI
file has the proper location of the video drivers for the particular
workstation.

Note: If the DOSSHELL.INI can't be found when MS-DOS Shell is booting, it will
recreate an initialization file.
