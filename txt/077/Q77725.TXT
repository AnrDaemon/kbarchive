The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You must exit Windows version 3.0 and 3.0a and run Windows with
Multimedia Extensions again after adding a new Multimedia driver
within the Driver option in the Control Panel. This is so that the
changes can take effect.

This information does not apply to later versions of Windows.

When adding a new driver, the SYSTEM.INI file gets updated but not
reinitialized. This can only be done when first starting Windows with
Multimedia Extensions.
