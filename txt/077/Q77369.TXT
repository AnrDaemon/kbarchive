SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0 MIRROR deletion tracking utility may be loaded high
automatically without specifying a LOADHIGH or LH statement.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To following are requirements to automatically load MIRROR high:

 - An 80386 machine (required to load any device drivers and/or TSRs high under
   MS-DOS 5.0 memory management).

 - Include the following lines in the CONFIG.SYS file:

   device=c:\dos\himem.sys
   device=c:\dos\emm386.exe NOEMS [or] RAM
   dos=umb

 - A majority of the upper memory area (UMA) must not already be occupied by
   other device drivers or TSRs.

 - There should be an upper memory block (UMB) of at least 20K available even
   though MIRROR only occupies 6.4K of UMA after loading. The additional memory
   is required for initialization code and to preserve room for a growing
   deletion tracking table.

To load MIRROR automatically, you should load MIRROR before any network drivers
in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
