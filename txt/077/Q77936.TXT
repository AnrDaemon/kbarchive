SUMMARY
=======

The swap analysis tool provided with the version 3.0 of the Windows Software
Development Kit (SDK) is not included with version 3.1 of the Windows SDK. The
Windows 3.0 swap program was designed to run only in Windows real mode, which
has been removed from Windows 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are several tools available to assist with segment optimization.

Use the Microsoft Source Profiler to identify functions that are used or "hit"
frequently. These functions can be grouped into the same segment. Alternatively,
use a third-party source optimization tool such as The Segmentor from
MicroQuill. Finally, one can write a segment optimization tool using the
resources of the ToolHelp library provided with version 3.1 of the Windows SDK.
