SUMMARY
=======

The following five steps configure the amount of memory that the MCIWAVE driver
for Microsoft Windows uses to buffer audio data during playback or recording:

1. Run the Control Panel.

2. Select the Drivers icon.

3. Select the WaveAudio driver from the Installed Drivers list box.

4. Double-click the following line in the Installed Drivers list box:

   WaveAudio [MCI] Waveform Audio

5. Scroll the "Seconds" scroll bar to the right or to the left and select a
   buffer that stores between two and nine seconds of audio data, as desired.

Alternately, modify the size of the buffer in the SYSTEM.INI file. The numeric
parameter on the "WaveAudio" line in the [mci] section specifies the size of the
buffer. The following is a sample of the SYSTEM.INI file:

      [mci]
      WaveAudio=mciwave.drv 4

A four-second buffer is the default setting.
