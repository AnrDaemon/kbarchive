TITLE   :Leading Edge Memory Test Diagnostic May Cause System Hangs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.x
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Leading Edge has confirmed that the memory test option contained on their
Diagnostics Utility disk may cause the system to hang or lock up after upgrading
to MS-DOS version 5.0. Only a cold boot will restart the machine.

WORKAROUND
==========

To successfully run the Leading Edge memory test, HIMEM.SYS, EMM386.EXE, and any
other memory managers must be disabled and MS-DOS must not be loaded into the
high memory area (HMA).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Leading Edge Diagnostics Utility disk is included with each Leading Edge
computer system. This disk offers several system, hardware, and memory tests.
The memory test is executed by pressing the hot key (F2) from the main menu of
the diagnostics utility. To use the diagnostics utility, follow the directions
provided in the system documentation.

The memory test may hang the computer if a memory manager (such as EMM386.EXE or
HIMEM.SYS) is active or if MS-DOS is resident in the HMA. To allow the
diagnostic utility to run, remove all references to memory management software
(HIMEM.SYS, EMM386.EXE, and so on) and reboot the computer. Once the diagnostics
have been completed, return the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files to their
original state.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
or reliability.
