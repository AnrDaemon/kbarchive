The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Temporary files remain in the designated temporary directory when the computer
is shut off or rebooted while applications are still active in MS-DOS Shell. If
Shell is not active, these temporary files may be deleted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The names of the temporary files depend on the Shell setup. If Task Swapper is
enabled,the temporary files are named:

   XXXXDOSC.BAT

where XXXX is a system generated hexadecimal string.

The number of temporary files remaining depends on the number of tasks running at
the time of the power down or reboot. These files must be deleted manually.

If Task Swapper is not enabled, the following two temporary files remain:

   DOSSHELL.SWP
   C3BDOSCM.BAT

These files are deleted the next time Shell is invoked.

In both cases, the temporary files are located in either the directory specified
in the AUTOEXEC.BAT

   set temp=[drive spec]\[directory name]

line or in the DOS directory if SET TEMP=[drive spec]\[directory name] is not
used.

The contents of the file C3BDOSCM.BAT or XXXXDOSC.BAT are the commands used to
invoke the application. For example, if MS-DOS Editor was invoked for the file
AUTOEXEC.BAT, the contents of the generated batch file would be as follows:

   @EDIT AUTOEXEC.BAT


Additional query words: 5.00 dos shell dosshell bat batch 6.00 5.00a
