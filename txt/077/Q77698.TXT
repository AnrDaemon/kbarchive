SUMMARY
=======

When Microsoft Multimedia Windows is run, certain drivers, such as MMSOUND.DRV
and MMSYSTEM.DLL, are loaded immediately. An application can use this
information to determine whether Multimedia Windows is running, as follows:

      hModule = GetModuleHandle("mmsystem.dll");
      if (!hModule)
         {
         bMultimedia = FALSE;
         MessageBox(NULL,
              "This application should be run with MMWindows",
              "Alert", MB_OK);
         }

GetModuleHandle() attempts to retrieve the "module instance" handle to the
MMSYSTEM dynamic-link library (DLL). The return value is zero if MMSYSTEM has
not been loaded and greater than zero if MMSYSTEM is loaded. Therefore, when
hModule is zero, Multimedia Windows is not running; otherwise, Multimedia
Windows is running.
