SUMMARY
=======

If you do not enter the phone number in Phone Dialer the correct way, you cannot
use the Dialing Properties. For example, when you make an incorrect entry in
Phone Dialer, you do not receive the prefix for access to an outside line and
calling card. This article describes how to enter phone numbers in Phone Dialer
correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Many Windows-based programs that include dialing functions have separate fields
for the country code, the local area code and the phone number. For example,
Dial-Up Networking connections include this functionality. However, Phone Dialer
has only one field to enter the complete phone number.

If you type your phone number in this single field, Phone Dialer uses the phone
number as it as entered. This means that all of your dialing rules such as the
prefix for access to an outside line and so on are ignored.

To be able to use the dialing rules you set in the Modems tool in Control Panel,
you must enter the phone number in Phone Dialer in the international dialing
format beginning with a plus character as part of the country code and having
the local area code in parentheses (). For example:

+<country code> (<local area code>) <phone number>

The complete entry would appear like this:

+49 (89) 123456

When you use this format, Phone Dialer uses the dialing rules you set in the
Modems tool in Control Panel.
