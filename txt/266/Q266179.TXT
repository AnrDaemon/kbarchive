TITLE   :Unable to Create Volume When Adding a Directory to a Dfs Share
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Dfs Administrator to add a directory to a distributed file system
(Dfs) share, you may receive an error message indicating that the volume cannot
be created.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the directory you selected contains files. You can
add only empty directories to a Dfs share; you cannot use an existing share or
directory that contains files as a Dfs share.

RESOLUTION
==========

Either select an existing empty directory, or create a new directory to use as a
share point by typing a new, unused directory name.
