TITLE   :Roaming Profiles Do Not Load, Generate Errors 18 and 1009
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When users are required to use a roaming profile and a system policy, and the
default computer policy is set to delete the locally cached copies of roaming
profiles, some users may receive the following error messages when they attempt
to log on:

   "The Operating System was unable to load a locally stored profile. A new
   profile will be created. (1009)."

   "The operating system was unable to load your profile. Please contact your
   network administrator. [18]"

When you use the net helpmsg command to reveal the source of the error code, you
receive the following information:

   Error code 1009 is: "The registry database is corrupt".
   Error code 18 is: "There are no more files".

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the registry size on the workstations is too small.
This can cause duplicate entries for the roaming profiles to be written into the
HKEY_USERS hive.

RESOLUTION
==========

   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Log on to the computer as an Administrator or through a user account that is
   not required to use a roaming profile.

2. Remove the extraneous profiles from the registry:

   a. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32).

   b. Open the HKEY_USERS registry hive.

   c. Delete any duplicate Security Identifier (SID) registry keys for the
      roaming profile.

      NOTE: You can find which SID matches a given user profile by looking at the
      data for the ProfileImagePath registry value in the following registry
      location:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows
      NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList\SID#

   d. Quit the Registry Editor.

3. Increase the size of the registry:

   a. In Control Panel, double-click System.

   b. Click Performance.

   c. In the Virtual Memory group, click Change.

   d. View the Current Registry Size and the Maximum Registry Size.

   e. In the Maximum Registry Size box, type a number greater than the current
      registry size and then click OK.

   f. Click Close, and then restart your computer to effect the new settings.
