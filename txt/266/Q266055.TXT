-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 4.01, 4.01 Service Pack 1 for Windows 95

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you restart a computer after installing a third-party software product, you
may receive an error message explaining that the Protected Storage Service did
not start. The exact error message varies, depending on the operating system
(Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows NT 4.0). However, the message indicates that
the Protected Storage Service did not load.

In Windows NT Workstation 4.0, the error message generates the logging of Event
127, indicating that the service failed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the Protected Storage Service is attempting to
execute an application programming interface (API) call to an Imagehlp.dll file
that does not exist in the older .dll files.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the issue, check for the presence of an Imagehlp.dll file in the
Winnt\System32 folder for Windows NT or in the Windows\System folder for Windows
95 or 98.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The file's size and date should be as follows:

Windows NT Workstation 4.0, Internet Explorer 4.01: 104KB, 11/18/97
Windows NT Workstation 4.0, Internet Explorer 4.01, Service Pack 1: 104KB,
5/8/98
Windows 95 or 98: 112KB, 5/11/98

If the file is dated earlier than 1997, then either it needs to be replaced with
the one from Internet Explorer 4.01 or you need to reinstall Internet Explorer
4.01.
