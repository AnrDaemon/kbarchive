TITLE   :XADM: ADC Er. Mssg.: Server Specified on the Connection Page...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::2000,5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3, used with:
    - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure a new Connection Agreement for the Active Directory Connector
(ADC) on a computer that is running Windows 2000 Server and Exchange Server 5.5
Service Pack 3 and is a domain controller, if you click Add on the From Exchange
tab to add an Exchange Server recipients container, or click Modify on the From
Windows tab to add an Exchange Server default destination, you may receive the
following error message:

   The Microsoft Exchange server specified on the Connections page is invalid.
   Enter a valid server name.
   ID no: c103aa1a
   Microsoft Active Directory Connector Management

On the Connections tab, the Exchange Server computer name is displayed correctly.
The server name fields on this tab are not case sensitive. Verify that the
Exchange Server computer name is the server name as it appears in the Exchange
Server Administrator program (not the Windows 2000 Server name) and that the
Exchange Server computer name is spelled correctly.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) port
that Exchange Server is listening on has been changed because Exchange Server
and Active Directory are both located on the same server.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, determine which LDAP port Exchange Server is
currently using, and change the LDAP port on the Connections tab of the
Connection Agreement properties to the LDAP port number that Exchange Server is
currently using.

To determine which LDAP port Exchange Server is currently using:

1. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program.

2. Under the server name, click Protocols.

3. In the right pane, double-click LDAP (Directory) Settings.

4. Check the LDAP port number that is displayed on the General tab.
