TITLE   :Windows SFU 2.0 BDC Installation Will Fail w/ Error 26031
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When installing Windows Services For UNIX Version 2.0 on a Windows NT 4.0 Backup
Domain Controller (BDC) you receive the following error message:

   Error 26031. Setup failed to create the localgroup PasswordPropDeny

CAUSE
=====

This occurs when you are trying to install Windows Services For UNIX 2.0
Password Synchronization on the Backup Domain Controller.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, do not attempt to install the Password Synchronization
module on a Windows NT 4.0 Backup Domain Controller.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows Services For UNIX
Version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows Services For UNIX Version 2.0 Password Synchronization requires the
creation of a Local Group called PasswordPropDeny. Because Windows NT 4.0 Backup
Domain Controllers do not maintain a local user accounts database, it is
impossible for the installer to create this group. This causes the installation
of SFU to fail.
