SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 Service Pack 1 (SP1) with Key Management
(KM) server introduced the capability to use X.509 V3 certificates with Exchange
Server advanced security. With the robust public key infrastructure that is
built into the Microsoft Windows 2000 Server operating system, you can combine
KM server with a number of different certification authority configurations to
achieve 128-bit advanced security with the Microsoft Outlook e-mail client. A
white paper that describes a variety of scenarios that integrate Windows 2000
Server certification authorities with Exchange Server 5.5 advanced security is
available.
