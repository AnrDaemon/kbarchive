TITLE   :XCLN: IMAP Clients Unable to See Attachments
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use an Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) e-mail client to view a
message that was sent from an Exchange Server computer, you may notice that
attachments are not visible. You can view the attachments correctly with
Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) and Post Office Protocol
version 3 (POP3) clients and Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA). This issue
affects messages that are sent to another Exchange Server site by site
connectors or X.400 Connectors. Recipients in the site can see the attachments
properly.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev1 (IMAP4)
is configured to use Microsoft Exchange rich-text format on the sender's
Exchange Server computer. This prevents IMAP clients from viewing the
attachments; the messages look like messages that do not contain attachments
when you view the messages in the IMAP mail viewer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, open the properties of the
   IMAP4 protocol object.

2. Click the Message Format tab, and then make sure that the Use Microsoft
   Exchange rich-text Format check box is clear.
