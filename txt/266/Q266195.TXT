TITLE   :SMS 2.0  Packages Are Not Distributed to Child Sites
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you create a new package, you do not see the package sent to any child
sites. Looking in Schedule.box\ToSend shows a backlog of files, and Sched.log
shows an error that states:

   Skipping minijob. Could not retrieve the request ID

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the Sms\Inboxes\Schedule.box\Uid folder is empty
or does not exist. The SMS\Inboxes\Schedule.box\Uid folder is expected to have
only two files, the .req and .job files. If there are more than two files, the
Scheduler component can also become confused about which job ID is to be used
for the next job.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, you must open the Sms\Inboxes\Schedule.box\Uid folder
and create two empty text files called <nnnnnnnn>.job and
<nnnnnnnn>.req, where <nnnnnnnn> is the number in the filename,
which is greater than any of the files' names that were already found in the
directory SMS\Inboxes\Schedule.box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is an example of a log error message recorded in the Sched.log
file when the behavior occurs:

   Error. Could not give send request to scheduler. Possibly could not reach the
   schedule box on the site server. Skipping minijob.

Additional query words: prodsms sched log
