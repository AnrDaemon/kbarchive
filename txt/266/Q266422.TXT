KEYWORDS:kbClient kbConfig kbRemote kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbHelpDesk kbsmsUtil kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Remote Control on a Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 client
computer that is running Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98, you may
receive a general protection (GP) fault in Wuser32. This behavior can occur on
computers that contain a Matrox Millennium G400 video adapter.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are four possible workarounds:

 - Use the Standard VGA driver on the client.

 - Disable Remote Control for the site that is experiencing the problem.

 - Prevent the SMS client from being installed on the computer that contains the
   G400 video adapter by using IP subnetting or scripting.

 - Contact Matrox support for a driver that does not exhibit this behavior.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
