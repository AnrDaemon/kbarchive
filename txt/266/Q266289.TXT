SUMMARY
=======

This article illustrates how to use the Split function to separate a delimited
string into a string array. Although the Microsoft Visual Basic product
documentation describes how to use the Split function, the product documentation
does not contain an example that uses the Split function.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Split Function returns a one-dimensional array, which contains a specified
number of substrings. You can use this function to put a string separated by a
character delimiters into a string array to get the value of each substring.

Use the following steps to create the sample project:

1. Create a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a CommandButton to Form1.

3. Add the following code to the code window of Form1:

   Option Explicit

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
      Dim strTest As String
      Dim strArray() As String
      Dim intCount As Integer
      
      strTest = "Fred & Wilma & Barney & Betty"
      strArray = Split(strTest, "&")
      
      For intCount = LBound(strArray) To UBound(strArray)
         Debug.Print Trim(strArray(intCount))
      Next
   End Sub

4. From the View menu, click Immediate Window.

5. On the Run menu, click Start or press the F5 key to start the program.

6. Click the Command1 command button.

RESULTS: Each name in the strTest variable appears on an individual line.
