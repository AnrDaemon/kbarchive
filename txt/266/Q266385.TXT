TITLE   :Err Msg: The Stub Received Bad Data
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:3.0,4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOSWin2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 3.0, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Internet Service Manager on a computer running Internet
Information Server (IIS) version 3.0 to remotely administer Internet Information
Server (IIS) version 4.0 or Internet Information Services (IIS) version 5.0, you
may receive the following error message:

   The stub received bad data

CAUSE
=====

This error message appears because IIS 3.0 was not designed to administer IIS
4.0 or IIS 5.0. It is possible to do this on a Windows NT 4.0-based computer
that has IIS 3.0 Service Pack 4 or earlier installed; however, with later
service packs, the option is no longer available and does not function.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade the computer running IIS 3.0 to IIS 4.0 by
installing the Windows NT Option Pack (NTOP), and then re-applying the latest
Windows NT Service Pack. You can then use the Microsoft Management Console (MMC)
to administer other computers running IIS 4.0 or IIS 5.0.
