======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

After installing the pcAnywhere program by Symantec, you may receive the
following error message:

   An error occurred while Windows was working with the control panel file
   c:\winnt\system32\desk.cpl

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because of a conflict between the video drivers that the
computer uses and the drivers that pcAnywhere uses. This conflict usually occurs
with the Awvideo.dll file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, prevent the Awvideo.dll file from loading, and
then reinstall the driver that reloads the video driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Rename the Awvideo.dll file.

2. Install the correct video driver.

3. Rename the Awvideo.dll file back to its original name.
