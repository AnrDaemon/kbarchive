OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When message flow across an MS Mail connector to Exchange Server 5.5 stops, the
following message may appear in the application log of Event Viewer:

   Error 4536-Incomplete or missing routing information at <server name>.
   Routing could not be determined due to an external member in a group
   definition.

Event IDs 4304, 4355, and 4395 also appear in the application log.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur when the P1 directory no longer exists.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, add the P1 directory and then restart the Microsoft Mail
(PC) message transfer agent (MTA).

MORE INFORMATION
================

To add the P1 directory, follow these steps:

1. Verify that the permissions on the Exchange servers are correct.

2. Copy the Network.glb file to a local drive, and then, from the command
   prompt, type
   "Network.glb" (without the quotation marks)
   Confirm that the size of the Network.glb file is a multiple of 122 bytes, and
   that the associated .xtn files are consistent.

3. At the command prompt, run the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Mail Integrity
   Check (Mailint.exe).

4. Add the P1 directory to the Maildata directory.

5. Copy Populate.msm from another postoffice subdirectory to the P1 directory.

6. In Control Panel, double-click Services, and then start PC MTA.
