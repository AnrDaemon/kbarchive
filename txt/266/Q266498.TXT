======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta Africana, Third Edition 
 - Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia Deluxe 2001 for Windows

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Encarta Researcher in any of the programs listed at
the beginning of this article to save a new project, you may receive the
following message:

   <drive>:\My Documents\<filename>.txt already exists.
   Do you want to replace it?

NOTE: If you click Yes, the <filename>.txt file is not replaced. Encarta
Researcher creates a file named <filename>.txt.erp, where <filename>
is the name of the file that you are saving.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you save an Encarta Researcher project with a name
that is identical to the name of a text (.txt) file that is located in the My
Documents folder.

NOTE: By default, the Encarta Researcher saves project files in the My Documents
folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, click Yes to save the file with the current file name and
an Encarta Researcher Project (.erp) extension, or click No, to save the file
with a different file name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.
