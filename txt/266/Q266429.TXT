TITLE   :BUG: "Invalid DOS Path" Error with VSS Command Line GET
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe500 kbSSafe500bug kbSSafe600 kbSSafe600bug _IK kbGrpDSSSafe

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you execute a Visual SourceSafe command line GET with the -gf switch on a
file, if the working folder does not exist, you may receive the following error
message:

   Invalid DOS Path

CAUSE
=====

The GET command assumes that the working folder has already been created.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, execute the following commands:

   " ss get $/project1 -gf -g-
   ss get $/project1/test.txt -gf " (without the quotation marks)

The first command creates the directory structure, and the second command does a
GET on the Test.txt file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a project named project1, and place a file named Test.txt in the
   project.

2. Set the working folder for project1 to C:\project1.

3. When you receive the message "C:\project1 does not exist, do you want to
   create it?", click OK.

4. Delete C:\project1.

5. From a command line, type the following (execute this command from the
   Vss\Win32 folder):

   " ss get $/project1/test.txt -gf " (without the quotation marks)
