======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On the German Windows operating system with the localized version of Visual
FoxPro 5.x or 6.x, save a program file whose name starts with "Neu," such as
NeuTest.prg. When you open the file again, you do not see the previously saved
code in the editor; instead, a new file opens. Similar behavior occurs when you
are saving files of type form and class.

RESOLUTION
==========

Rename the VFP6deu.dll file to VFP6enu.dll. This allows the previously saved
code to be opened in the editor again. However, with VFP6enu.dll, the Visual
FoxPro menu is in English rather than in German.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Install localized German version of Visual FoxPro 6.x on a German OS
   computer.

2. Create a new project named "p1."

3. Create a new program.

4. In the .prg file, type in the following command:

   WAIT WINDOW "TEST"
   X=1

5. Close the .prg file and save it as Neutest.prg.

6. In the Command window, issue the following command:

   MODIFY COMMAND NEUTEST.PRG

Note that you do not see the previously saved code in the editor. Instead, a new
file opens.
