TITLE   :SMS: The Package Source Is Removed from Package Properties
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.2,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) version 1.2, the package
source for your packages may disappear which can prevent you from distributing
packages. If you retype the package source data, your computer system
periodically removes it.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by Application Manager.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, quit the SMS Executive service, and then rename
the Appmgr.dll file to the Appmgr.old file. Then restart the SMS Executive
service. While Application Manager is disabled, it cannot blank out the package
source entry and you can investigate which address is causing the problem.

To locate the problem address, perform either of the following two methods:

 - In SMS Administrator, view the site properties of the site that has the
   problem, and then click Addresses. Examine the list of addresses and locate
   the address of a child site which contains the primary site's server name.

-or-

 - Open the Sitectrl.ct0 file from \Sms\Site.srv\Sitecfg.box, in Microsoft
   Windows Notepad, and examine the list of addresses and locate the address of
   a child site which contains the primary site's server name. For example:

   Primary site: Smsprimary Sitecode: SCF
   Secondary site: Smssecondary Sitecode: PJF

The problem occurs when the address for the PJF site at the primary site is
defined as '\\Smsprimary\SMS_SITE', instead of the correct setting of
'\\Smssecondary\SMS_SITE'.
When the problem address (or addresses) are corrected, you can quit the SMS
Executive service, rename the Appmgr.old file to the Appmgr.dll file, and then
restart the SMS Executive service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Application Manager replicates the package properties data from parent to
child.

A normal process for the packages created at the parent site involves Application
Manager blanking the package source on a child site, and then replacing it with
"Use Compressed Copy". The source is located on the parent, not the child. If an
address is incorrectly configured, for example, the address to a child site
lists the server name of the parent, Application Manager activates, causing it
to blank the property on itself.
