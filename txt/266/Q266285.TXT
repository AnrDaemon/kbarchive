TITLE   :Cannot Use SQL Server with Certificate Server 1.0
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOSWin2000 kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Certificate Server version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

For various reasons, developers might want to use a Microsoft SQL Server
database with Certificate Server 1.0 instead of the Microsoft Access database it
uses by default. This configuration is not supported by Microsoft. Certificate
Server 1.0 was not designed to use SQL Server as its database.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you need a more reliable or more flexible public key infrastructure (PKI)
than Certificate Server 1.0 offers, the best solution is to move to Certificate
Services 2.0, which is included with Microsoft Windows 2000. Certificate
Services 2.0 uses a different kind of database that is not ODBC-compliant.
