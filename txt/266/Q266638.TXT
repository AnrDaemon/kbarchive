The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3, 5.5 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the information store (Store.exe) receives a message that includes a
double-byte character set (DBCS) display name with a missing tailing byte by
means of Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) or Internet Message Access
Protocol, Version 4rev1 (IMAP4) protocol, the information store causes an access
violation with the following call stacks:

   

   Function Name
