PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you have restarted for the first time after applying Service Pack 4 on a
computer running Windows NT Workstation 4.0, you may find that the computer
stops responding (hangs). At the point where it hangs, the computer may be
having trouble processing a driver or the hardware abstraction layer (HAL).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, do a parallel installation, and then copy the
program's files from the new installation to the old installation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Start a parallel installation of Windows NT Workstation 4.0.

2. Install Service Pack 4.

3. Restart to the new parallel installation and make sure it is working
   correctly.

4. Move the files (not the subfolder) from \%SystemRoot%\System32\ of the old
   installation to a backup folder.

5. Move the Drivers folder from \%SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers\ of the old
   installation to a backup folder.

6. Copy the files (not the subfolder) from the \%SystemRoot%\System32\ folder of
   the new installation to the \%SystemRoot%\System32\ folder of the old
   installation.

7. Copy the Drivers folder from the \%SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers\ folder of
   the new installation to the \%SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers\ folder of the old
   installation.

8. Restart the computer to the original installation.

9. Once you can gain access to the original installation, copy over only the
   backup files (not the subfolder) of the \%SystemRoot%\System32\ folder.

10. When you are prompted to replace the files, click No.

NOTE: This should restore most program .dll files, unless a program has replaced
an original Windows NT 4.0 .dll file with its own version. In that case, you may
need to reinstall the program.
