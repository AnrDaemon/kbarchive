KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the message transfer agent (MTA) service starts during cluster setup, the
MTA may log the following incorrect 9405 error message:

   An unexpected error has occurred which may cause the MTA to terminate.
   Error: Allocate more buffer space 260. [BASE MAIN BASE 1] (16)

This error message is not harmful; the MTA service starts successfully and
continues to run without any errors.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if more buffer space needs to be allocated for the returned
node name. In the MTA service records this as fatal error, however, the MTA
correctly allocates more buffer space.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
