TITLE   :XADM: Rules That Use an SMTP Address Do Not Run
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you specify the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) address in the To box
of a message, rules may not run after you install anti-virus software that uses
the virus application programming interface (API).

The To box no longer displays the SMTP address of the recipient but it resolves
to the display name of the mailbox. In the open message, if you right-click the
recipient in the To box, and then click Properties, you receive the properties
for the Exchange Server mailbox; if the header does not resolve to the display
name, you receive the SMTP properties.

CAUSE
=====

The following registry key is enabled when you install an API virus solution:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters\ReRouteViaStore

When this registry key is enabled, all messages must pass through the information
store and resolve the P2 header to the display name in the folder. When the P2
header is resolved, the rule is no longer triggered.

WORKAROUND
==========

Contact the anti-virus software vendor for information about how to disable this
registry key and for information about the effect of disabling this registry
key.

You can create or modify rules to run when the rules are addressed to the
Exchange Server mailbox display name instead of an SMTP address.
