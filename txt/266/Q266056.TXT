SYMPTOMS
========

When you are performing an upgrade from Windows NT Workstation 3.51 to Windows
NT Workstation 4.0 on a Hewlett-Packard Vectra computer with an S3 video card
installed, and you manually try to change the video settings, you may receive
the following error messages:

   The drivers were not installed successfully

   You may not have required privileges to install drivers

When you check the VgaStart, the VgaSave, and the S3 keys in the registry, you
find that the correct permissions are set.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because of registry corruption.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, install a parallel copy of Windows NT Workstation 4.0
and boot to the parallel installation. Use the Registry Editor to edit the
system hive of the original installation to boot to VGA. Boot to the original
installation, and reinstall the video drivers.

   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To make the necessary changes, follow these steps:

1. Install a parallel installation of Windows NT Workstation 4.0.

2. Restart the computer to the parallel installation.

3. Copy the Vga.dll file from the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder of the parallel
   installation to the same folder of the original installation.

4. Edit the registry to configure the original installation to start in VGA
   mode:

   a. From the parallel installation, use Registry Editor (Regedt32) to load the
      system hive of the original installation:

      1. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive, click HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. Select the
         Registry menu, and then click Load Hive.

      2. Browse to the %SystemRoot%\System32\Config\ folder of the original
         installation, click System, and then click Open.

      3. In the Key Name box, type "Test" (without the quotation marks), and
         then click OK.

   b. Edit the original system hive:

      1. Use Registry Editor to locate the following registry key:

         HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\TEST\ControlSetXXX\Services\VgaSave

         (where XXX represents the control set number that your computer should
         start from the next time you restart it).

         NOTE: The number of the control set you need to locate is determined by
         the registry value Current in the following registry location:

         HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Select

      2. Make sure the value data for the ImagePath value reads:

         SystemRoot\System32\Drivers\Vga.sys

      3. Locate the following registry key:

         HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\TEST\ControlSetXXX\Services\VgaSave\Device0

      4. In the right pane of the Registry Editor window, double-click the value
         InstalledDisplayDrivers. Change the value data to VGA, and then click
         OK.

   c. Unload the system hive of the original installation to save the changes:

      1. Collapse the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\TEST key. Make sure it is highlighted.

      2. On the Registry menu, click Unload Hive, and then click Yes to confirm
         the command.

5. Restart the computer in VGA mode to the original installation.

6. Reinstall the driver for your video adapter.

7. Perform the preceding steps also for the following registry keys:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSetXXX\Services\S3

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSetXXX\Services\VgaStart
