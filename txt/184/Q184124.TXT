TITLE   :Service Still Runs Although WinNT Prompts to Turn Off Computer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Disk activity remains constant even though Windows NT Server or Workstation
displays the following message:

   It is now safe to turn off your computer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can be caused by a service not properly notifying the Windows NT
Service Control Manager (SCM) that it is still running. It is the service's
responsibility to let the SCM know that it is still active. If the SCM is aware
that a service is still pending shut down, it, by default, will wait 20 seconds
before killing the service. If the service has incorrectly notified the SCM, the
SCM may assume that the service has shut down.

This behavior has been seen with virus-scanning software

RESOLUTION
==========

As a workaround, verify that a scheduled scan is not due to run before you start
the Shut Down procedure.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For other services experiencing the problem, the amount of time that Windows NT
waits for services to shut down can be increased using the
WaitToKillServiceTimeout value name in the registry.

For additional information on increasing the wait time, please see the following
