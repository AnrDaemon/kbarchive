======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article shows how to use AppleScript to start an instance of Microsoft
Internet Explorer 4.0 and automatically go to a valid website address.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This example takes an Internet address stored in a file and uses AppleScript to
start Internet Explorer 4.0, read the address from the file, and direct Internet
Explorer to the desired address. The article assumes that Simple Text created
the text file because the "Open For Access" command in AppleScript only reads
files that have the TXT creator type. One can create a text file using FoxPro
and later change the creator type. To do this, please refer to the article
listed in the REFERENCES section.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a text file named ztest.txt, using the Simple Text application, that
   contains the following Web address:

   http://www.microsoft.com

   Save the file to the root folder of your hard drive.

2. Open the Apple Script Editor and type the following commands:

         set filename to (open for access alias "HD_name:ztest.txt")
         set mydata to (read filename)
         close access filename
         tell application "HD_name:Internet Explorer 4.0 Preview 1:Internet
         Explorer 4.0" to run
         tell application "HD_name:Internet Explorer 4.0 Preview 1:Internet
         Explorer 4.0" to GetURL (mydata)

   NOTE: Each line listed above should be type as a complete line within the
   Apple Script Editor. To ensure that you have typed the Apple Script commands
   correctly, press the Check Syntax button in the Apple Script Editor.

   Please note that you must give a complete path to the text file and Internet
   Explorer. If you do not, an error will occur. If you are not sure of the
   exact path, press the Apple key and "F" to invoke the File Find dialog and
   search for the application. In the example above, substitute the name of your
   Macintosh hard drive for "HD_name" and specify the path where Internet
   Explorer is installed.

3. Save the AppleScript file as a Compiled Script type with the name ZIE4test to
   the home folder of FoxPro.

4. Run the Apple Script from FoxPro or Visual FoxPro using the following
   command:

         RunScript ZIE4test
