 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you update in Microsoft Word 6.x or later a table of contents created in a
Microsoft Word for the Macintosh 5.1 document, the following error message may
appear:

   Error! No table of contents entries found.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs when the table of contents in the Word 5.1 document was created
using heading styles and then the first entry is changed to a style other than a
heading style in the body of the document. When the document is converted the
TOC field is incorrectly converted.

==========

To work around this behavior, use one of the following methods:

Method 1: Re-apply Heading Styles in the Word 5.1 Document
----------------------------------------------------------

Open the document in Word 5.1 and re-apply the missing heading styles.

Method 2: Remove the \f Parameter from the TOC Field
----------------------------------------------------

1. Select the table of contents.

2. Press SHIFT+F9 (Windows) or OPTION+F9 (Macintosh) to show field codes.

3. Remove the \f parameter.

4. Press SHIFT+F9 (Windows) or OPTION+F9 (Macintosh) to turn off field codes.

5. Press F9 to update the table of contents.

Method 3: Replace the Table of Contents
---------------------------------------

1. Select the existing table of contents.

2. Press DELETE to remove the existing table of contents.

3. On the Insert menu, click Index And Tables, and then click the Table Of
   Contents tab.

4. Click OK.
