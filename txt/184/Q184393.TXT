-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0 for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the HTML Administrator (HTMLA) for Internet Information Server
(IIS) version 4.0, holding down the SHIFT key while clicking links in Internet
Explorer 4.0 (IE4) may produce the following error message in your browser:

   Internet Explorer Script Error
   An error has occurred in the script on this page.
   Error: Object expected

CAUSE
=====

Holding down the SHIFT key in Internet Explorer 4.0 forces the browser to load
the page into a new instance of the browser, so all scripted object links to the
referring page or frame are broken.
