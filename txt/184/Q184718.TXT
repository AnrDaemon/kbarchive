TITLE   :XADM: Text Attachments Modified for Internet Mail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A small text file attachment (140 characters or fewer) containing line-feed
<LF> characters, but no carriage-return line-feed combinations
<CR><LF>, will be modified during outbound delivery of the Internet
Mail Service. The modification will be the extra insertion of a
<CR><LF> just after the original <LF> character, resulting in
a <LF><CR><LF> combination at the end of each line. This may
cause problems for the receiving system.

CAUSE
=====

A logic error treats the text file attachment as a text/plain body part with
7-bit encoding. Larger attachments (those greater than 140 characters), are
being encoded as Quoted-Printable, which correctly preserves the <LF>
character sequences.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
