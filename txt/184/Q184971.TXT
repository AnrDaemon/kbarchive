PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsound kbui kbimu msgame

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outwars, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you play Microsoft Outwars, music in the game may start and stop, or the
music volume may abruptly change.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the volume levels for wave audio and CD audio do not
match.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Insert the Outwars CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive, and then start Outwars.

2. On the Outwars startup screen, click Options.

3. Click Sound.

4. When the Sound Options screen opens, you hear the wave audio. Under
   Interactive Music Balance, click the left or right Wav Music arrows to set
   the volume level you want for the wave audio.

5. Under Interactive Music Balance, click the CD Music volume control. When you
   do so, you hear the CD audio. Click the left or right CD Music arrow to
   adjust the volume level for the CD audio to match the volume level for the
   wave audio.

   NOTE: When you set both the wave and CD audio to the same volume level, the
   Wav Music and CD Music volume controls are not necessarily set to the same
   numeric value.

6. If both the CD and wave audio do not play, click the right Master Volume
   arrow to increase the volume level in the game.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The interactive music system used by Outwars combines the CD and wave audio to
match the action in the game.
