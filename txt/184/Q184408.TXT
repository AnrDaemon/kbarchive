SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to replace system files that are in use by using the
Mv.exe tool included with the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Mv.exe tool is a 32-bit version of the POSIX MV tool. Mv.exe has the
following syntax:

   mv [/x [/d]] <file1> [<file2> ...] <target>

The command-line switches are:

/x: Do not save files that are replaced.

/d: Delay file move until system reboot.

For example, to replace the Url.dll file in the Winnt\System32 folder with the
Url.dll file located in the Temp folder at the next reboot without saving the
replaced file, type the following line:

   mv.exe /x /d c:\temp\url.dll c:\winnt\system32\url.dll

There are two versions of Mv.exe in the Windows NT Resource Kit, a 32-bit
Windows-based version and a Posix version. The correct version to use in this
instance, the Windows version, is located on the Windows NT Resource Kit CD-ROM
in the <platform>\filebat\mv.exe folder.
