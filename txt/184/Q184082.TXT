SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use the Assoc command to display or change file
extensions and their associations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Assoc command can be run only from a command prompt.

NOTE: When you use the Assoc command, the changes you make are immediately
written to the Software registry file.

 - To display a list of file extensions and their associations, type "assoc"
   (without the quotation marks) at a command prompt, and then press ENTER.

 - To display the association for a specific file extension, type "assoc
   .<xxx>" (without the quotation marks) at a command prompt, and then
   press ENTER, where <xxx> is the file extension whose association you
   want to view.

 - To change the association for a specific file extension, type "assoc
   .<xxx>=<file type>" (without the quotation marks) at a command
   prompt, and then press ENTER, where <xxx> is the file extension whose
   association you want to change, and <file type> is the program, dynamic
   data exchange (DDE), or OLE object you want to associate with the file
   extension.

 - To delete the association for a specific file extension, type "assoc
   .<xxx>= " (without the quotation marks) at a command prompt, and then
   press ENTER, where <xxx> is the file extension you want to delete.

   NOTE: You must type the trailing space after the equal sign (=). If you do
   not, the association is not deleted and you receive the following error
   message:

   File association not found for extension .<xxx>
