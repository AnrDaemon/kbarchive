======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Linker (LINK.EXE), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0sp3 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0sp3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following warning was introduced in the linker shipped with Visual Studio 97
Service Pack 3:

   Warning LNK4108:
   /ALIGN specified without /DRIVER or /VXD; image may not run

MORE INFORMATION
================

The /ALIGN option has been specified without also specifying either the /DRIVER
or /VXD option.

Bad alignment can prevent the operating system from loading the final image. Do
not use the /ALIGN option unless building a driver or virtual device driver
(VxD).

This warning occurs even when you specify the documented default value for the
/ALIGN option.


You might see this warning when you use the linker included with Visual Studio 97
Service Pack 3 to build a makefile created in a Visual C++ 4.x project because
the Win32.mak supplied with Visual C++ 4.x contains the /ALIGN switch.
