To improve game performance in Golf, use the following methods:

Quit Unnecessary Programs
-------------------------

To increase the amount of available resources on your computer, quit all programs
that are running before you start Golf.

Disable Extra Game Features

requirements to play Golf. To disable these features, follow these steps:

1. Click Options, and then click Game Preferences.

   NOTE: You may want to leave the Commentary feature enabled if game performance
   is satisfactorily improved by turning off the other features.

3. Click OK.

following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
