The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1, the Outlook Web Access (OWA) client
allows you to check and resolve names for e-mail recipients.

You can control the maximum number of names displayed and the total lines of
recipients displayed when resolving a name. This is handled through the
following settings in the file Constant.inc located in the
C:\Exchsrvr\Webdata\<lang> directory:

   iCNMaxResolveNames = 10  {default setting}
   iCNMaxLines        = 100 {default setting}

MORE INFORMATION
================

If your Global Address List contains many variations of common names such as
John or Susan, you may want to increase the value for iCNMaxResolveNames.
Otherwise, you may receive the following message when you attempt to resolve the
name with the OWA client:

   Too many matches for Susan (11 found)
   Ignore this recipient
   Delete this recipient

The reason you are receiving this message is because the client located 11
instances of the name Susan. However, the default setting for Maximum Number of
Resolved Names displayed is set to 10.

If you receive the following message, you may have the ICNMaxLines set too low
and OWA cannot display all the variations of the multiple recipients found:

   Due to limits on the size of this dialog, 1 recipients could not be shown.
   Resolve the recipients shown above, then press Check Names again to complete
   the resolution of ambiguous recipients.

NOTE: Included in the total number of lines displayed are the two lines that
display the "Ignore this recipient" and "Delete this recipient" messages.
