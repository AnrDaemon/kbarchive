TITLE   :XADM: Error -1811 Running Edbutil or Eseutil With /T Option
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Edbutil /d /t fails with the following error:

   Operation terminated with error -1811 ...

CAUSE
=====

The /t option is specified incorrectly.

The following command line will fail with -1811:

   Edbutil /d /ispriv /th:\

The following scenario will also fail with -1811:

   Map Drive Letter to H:\ to <computername>\shared directory

   Edbutil /d /ispriv /th:\shared\tempdfrg.edb

Because the H:\ drive is already mapped to the shared directory, the above
command fails when it does not find a "sub-directory" called "shared" to put the
Tempdfrg.edb file into.

WORKAROUND
==========

The correct command line using Edbutil or Eseutil /d with the /t option is as
follows:

   Edbutil /d </ispriv /ispub or /ds> /t<drive
   letter>:\tempfilename

   -or-

   Eseutil /d </ispriv /ispub or /ds> /t<drive letter>:\tempfilename

Example:

   Edbutil /d /ispriv /th:\tempdfrg.edb

MORE INFORMATION
================

Error -1811 refers to JET_errFileNotFound 4294965485.

EDBUTIL should be used with Exchange Server versions 4.0 and 5.0.

ESEUTIL should be used with Exchange Server version 5.5.
