The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When accessing a Public Folder in Outlook Web Access you receive the following
error message:

   You don't have the necessary permissions to view this folder.

This may be followed by a Java Script error referring to "line X." The client
allows you to proceed and see the directory structure.

CAUSE
=====

No public folder postings are available, or no public folders are set with
permissions other than Folder Visible properties.

WORKAROUND
==========

To ensure that public folders are not visible to users without permissions, use
the Exchange Administrator program to clear the Folder Visible property from
each folder for which this is wanted. You can also remove this attribute from
the public folder if you have permission to modify the properties from a client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the above listed versions.
