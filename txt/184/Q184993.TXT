MORE INFORMATION

All messages from Exchange Server to the Exchange Connector for cc:Mail are
submitted as normal messages. There are no other message classes in this
connector. All messages from the connector for cc:Mail to Exchange Server are
submitted as IPM.Notes. A subset of failed messages heading from Exchange Server
to the connector for cc:Mail will have MAPI NDRs generated, but not all. After a
message is handed off to IMPORT, only a text NDR can be returned.
