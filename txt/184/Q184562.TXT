HTTPMon Does Not Generate CSV Files
-----------------------------------

No data CSV files are generated in the OUTPUTDIRECTORY when the Microsoft HttpMon
service is started.

To work around this problem, obtain the updated version of Httpmon.exe. The new
version of Httpmon.exe 2.0 is build 011298.

For further information on this error and the location of the updated HttpMon,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q181372 HttpMon.exe Does Not Write to CSV File



Susrv.exe Missing from Companion CD-ROM
---------------------------------------

\IIS Resource Kit\Utility\ISP SignUp Server\WebDoc\signup2.htm states that the
user should, as part of the Setup process, run Susrv.exe. Susrv.exe is not
included on the IIS RK CD-ROM, and is no longer available for distribution.

The documentation error will be corrected in future reprints and editions of the
Microsoft Internet Information Server Resource Kit.


Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of the book, it may already
contain the above corrections.
