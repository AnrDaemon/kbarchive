TITLE   :XADM: Command-Line Export Fails on Custom Recipients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the command-line export utility and an export options file to
export custom recipients, you may get a CSV file that contains only header
information, or a CSV file that contains unwanted mailbox information instead of
or in addition to the custom recipient information.

WORKAROUND
==========

This problem usually results from over-configuring the export options file. If
you want only to export custom recipients from Exchange, then start by using the
following format in the export options file:

      [Export]
      Basepoint=/o=<Org Name>/ou=<Site Name>/cn=Recipients
      Container=<Recipients, or the subcontainer of Recipients that has the
      Custom Recipients>
      ExportObject=Remote <Remote exports Custom Recipients only>

NOTE: note there should be no spaces between the object parameters

Do not put an entry for HomeServer, because this will result in a CSV file that
contains only headers and no other information. For more information about this,
see Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q147854, "XADM: Custom Recipients DIR
Export Creates Headers-Only CSV".

For more information about command-line export and the export options file, see
the online Help (Admin /?) and pages 476-482 in the Microsoft Exchange Server
Administrator's Guide.
