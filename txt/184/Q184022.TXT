SYMPTOMS
========

If you change the font size of a letter, word, or line of text in a series of
lines, the line spacing between the line you are formatting and the one below it
will also change.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when you change the font size by using the Font dialog box
(on the Format menu, click Font) or the Increase Text Size or Decrease Text Size
buttons on the Formatting toolbar. It is a function of the user interface. This
allows space for character descenders, such as lower case "j", "y", or "g". The
line spacing adjusts to accommodate these characters.
