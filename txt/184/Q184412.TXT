SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to find a Web Presence Provider (WPP) to host your
FrontPage Web on the Internet.

be installed on the server hosting your Web. Some features may not function if
they are hosted on a server that does not support the FrontPage Server
Extensions.

Microsoft keeps a list of all Web Presence Providers (WPPs) that support the
FrontPage Server Extensions. For more information, please visit the following
