To add the saved document file name and path to the active document's title bar,
add the following macro code to your FileSave, FileSaveAs, or FileOpen macro:

      With ActiveDocument
         .ActiveWindow.Caption = .Path + "\" + .ActiveWindow.Document.Name
      End With

To modify the default FileSave command, use the following steps:

1. In a new Word document, point to Macro on the Tools menu, and then click
   Macros.

2. In the Macros in list, click Word Commands.

3. In the Macro Name list, click to select FileSave.

4. In the Macros in list, click "Normal.dot (global template)".

   NOTE: You can change the Macros in list to a custom template, if you only want
   to change the macro in a custom template.

5. Click Create.

6. In the Visual Basic Editor, add the following macro code to the end of the
   FileSave macro:

         With ActiveDocument
            .ActiveWindow.Caption = .Path + "\" + .ActiveWindow.Document.Name
         End With

   For example, the completed FileSave macro should read as follows:

   Sub FileSave()
   '
   ' FileSave Macro
   ' Saves the active document or template and adds the path
   ' and file name to document title bar.
   '
      ActiveDocument.Save

      With ActiveDocument
         .ActiveWindow.Caption = .Path + "\" + .ActiveWindow.Document.Name
      End With

   End Sub

7. On the File menu, click "Close and Return to Microsoft Word".

When you save your document, the file name and path appear in the title bar of
the active document window.

NOTE: If you add this sample macro code to your FileOpen macro, and you open a
document from the MRU (Most Recently Used) list on the File menu, the document
path and file name will not be added to the title bar of the active document
window. This is because the File menu MRU list does not use the default FileOpen
command in Word to open an existing document.
