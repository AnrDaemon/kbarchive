TITLE   :XFOR: cc:Mail Connector Sends Messages Twice Under Load
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0 5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail may send duplicate copies of
a message from Exchange to cc:Mail during the transmission. The problem depends
on timing and generates duplicates of a few messages just after the connector
begins processing the queue.


CAUSE
=====

The connector uses multiple threads to check notification messages for items to
be added to the queue. There is a small possibility of two threads accessing the
same notification and adding the message to the queue.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
