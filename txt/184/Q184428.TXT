The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After moving a server using the Move Server Wizard (Movesrvr), messages sent
from a user in the original site to a user on the moved server may result in a
non-delivery report (NDR).

CAUSE
=====

An NDR is generated because directory replication has not yet completed.

WORKAROUND
==========

Make sure that directory replication is working between the two sites and allow
time for replication to complete.
