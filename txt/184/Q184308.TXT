TITLE   :AutoCAD Web Viewer Directions Incomplete
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT:2.0,3.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The documentation for Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) and the
documentation for AutoCAD are in conflict regarding the configuration of the
AutoCAD Web Viewer. The AutoCAD documentation directs the user to the Registry
Editor and says to "add the mime type drawing/x-dwf(.dwf) using the information
in the online IIS documentation." This information is incomplete.

RESOLUTION
==========

MIME Type Configuration notes indicate that the entry should look like the
following:

   <mime type>, <file extension>, <command parameters>,
   <gopher type>

where the given example is:

   text/html, htm, /unused, 1

Internet Information Server MIME Mapping notes indicate that the entry should
look like the following:

   <mime type>, <file extension>,, <gopher type>

and specifically note the double comma before the gopher type.

Gopher types can be found at the end of Chapter 9 in the IIS online
documentation. Type 5 should be used for AutoCAD. Type 5 is described as "MS-DOS
binary archive." However, the documentation should say, "MS-DOS binary file with
the archive bit set."

<command parameters> is not found or referenced in the online documents.

The actual entry for AutoCAD is as follows:

   drawing/x-dwf,dwf,,5

This will enable the AutoCAD Web viewer on IIS.

STATUS
======

The online Microsoft Internet Information Server documentation is being reviewed
and will be updated as needed.
