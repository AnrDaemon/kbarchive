TITLE   :An Instance of the Service is Already Running

KEYWORDS:kbFEA kbWinNT400sp4fea

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

 

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a client attempts to connect to a COM server after the COM server starts, but
before the COM server registers its factory, the COM will attempt to start the
service. For a service like the World Wide Web Publishing Service (W3SVC) in
Internet Information Service version 4.0, the second attempt to connect to the
COM server will fail; however, the CoCreateInstance should succeed.

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Windows NT Option Pack, you may receive the following
error messages in the event log:

   System Error, Source=DCOM, Event ID=10005

   The event details contains the description:

   DCOM got error "An instance of the service is already running. "
   attempting to start the service IISADMIN with arguments "" in order
   to run the server:
   {A9E69610-B80D-11D0-B9B9-00A0C922E750}

   -OR-

   Application Error, Source=Ci, Category=CI Service, Event ID=4147

   The event details contains the description:

   The IISADMIN service is not available, so virtual roots cannot be indexed.

CAUSE
=====

These error messages are generated because another application, such as
Microsoft Transaction Server, has already started the DCOM (the Distributed
Component Object Model) Service. These messages do not indicate an actual
problem and are benign.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT version
4.0. For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base.
