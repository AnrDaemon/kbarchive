-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to enable Direct3D hardware acceleration in Microsoft
Outwars. To enable Direct3D hardware acceleration, you must install a display
adapter or an add-on 3D accelerator card that supports Direct3D.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To enable Direct3D hardware acceleration in Outwars, follow these steps:

1. On the startup menu, click Options.

2. Click Graphics.

3. Click to light the Use Direct3D box.

4. Click the up or down arrow to select the Direct3D driver you want to use. If
   only one display adapter is installed in the computer, Display is the only
   item in the list of available Direct3D drivers. If you install an add-on
   Direct3D accelerator card or an additional display adapter, Outwars adds it
   to the list of available Direct3D drivers.

   NOTE: When you enable Direct3D hardware acceleration, some lighting effects in
   Outwars may not work.
