TITLE   :PRB: Scroll Arrows Not Showing When DisplayCount = 1
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual FoxPro 6.0, setting the DisplayCount property to 1 causes the scroll
arrows not to show in the drop-down list box. However, clicking on the scroll
arrows location scrolls the list.

CAUSE
=====

There is not enough room to see the scroll arrows when the DisplayCount is equal
to 1; therefore, the scroll arrows do not appear.

RESOLUTION
==========

To see the scroll arrow in the drop-down list box, set the DisplayCount property
to two.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form.

2. Drop a Combo box object onto the form and named it combo1.

3. Place the following code in the Init of the form:

         Thisform.combo1.AddItem("One")
         Thisform.combo1.AddItem("Two")
         Thisform.combo1.AddItem("Three")
         Thisform.combo1.AddItem("Four")

4. Set the combo's DisplayCount property to 1.

5. Save and run the form.

After clicking the down arrow of the combo box, the drop-down list only displays
one item without scroll arrows.
