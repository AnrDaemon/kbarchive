======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RESOLUTION
==========

Set the prepared property of rdoQuery or PreparedStatement to false before
executing the query.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem exists in service pack 2 and service pack 3 releases of Visual
Basic 5.0; it did not exist in the original version of Visual Basic 5.0.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Standard EXE project.

2. From the Project menu, click References, and select "Microsoft Remote Data
   Object 2.0.

3. Place three command buttons on the form.

4. Paste the following code in the code window (NOTE: You need to modify the
   connection information to connect to your SQL Server):

   Sample Code

         Option Explicit
           Dim en As rdoEnvironment
           Dim cn As New rdoConnection
           Dim temptabl As String
           Dim ps As rdoPreparedStatement
           Dim qd As rdoQuery
           Dim cnstr As String

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
           Set en = rdoEngine(0)
           cnstr = "driver={SQL Server};server=YourServerName;" & _
             "database=pubs;uid=sa;pwd="
           Set cn = en.OpenConnection(dsname:="", prompt:=rdDriverNoPrompt, _
             Connect:=cnstr)
         End Sub

         Private Sub Command2_Click()
           temptabl = "select au_id into ##temp from authors"
           Set ps = cn.CreatePreparedStatement("", temptabl)
          ' ps.Prepared = False
           ps.Execute
           ps.Close

          'rdoQuery Code
          ' set qd = cn.CreateQuery("", temptabl)
          ' qd.Prepared = False
          ' qd.Execute
          ' qd.Close
         End Sub

         Private Sub Command3_Click()
           temptabl = "drop table  ##temp"
           Set ps = cn.CreatePreparedStatement("", temptabl)
          ' ps.Prepared = False
           ps.Execute
           ps.Close

          'RDO Query Code
          ' set qd = cn.CreateQuery("", temptabl)
          ' qd.Prepared = False
          ' qd.Execute
          ' qd.Close
         End Sub

5. Run the above code and press all three command buttons, one at a time, in
   order. Then press the second command button again and the error message
   appears.

6. Uncomment the ps.Prepared statements in Command_2Click() and
   Command_3Click(), and the error does not occur.

The rdoQuery code functions the same way and has been included for your
convenience.
