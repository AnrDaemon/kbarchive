SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to wrap text around an image in FrontPage.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To wrap text around an image on your page, follow these steps:

1. On the Insert menu, click Image.

2. Select the image you want to insert and click OK.

3. Click the image to select it

4. Click the Align Left or Align Right button on the Formatting toolbar to
   select the alignment you want.

   NOTE: The text wrapping behavior only functions correctly with the left or
   right alignment settings for the image.

You will see a marker (a left or right arrow icon) in Normal view in FrontPage
Editor. This marker represents the align attribute on the paragraph (<P>)
tag in the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) source code. Any text that you place
before the marker will not wrap around the image. Any text that you place after
the marker will wrap around the image. You can determine where the text wraps
around the image by dragging the marker to a new location. The marker will not
be visible in a Web browser.
