TITLE   :XADM: Store.exe Working Set Performance Counter Keeps Growing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Working Set performance counter keeps increasing under a moderate load. When
the load has subsided, the counter remains constantly high. It does not decrease
memory used.

CAUSE
=====

The Store.exe process has a counter called "Working Set." This counter displays
the current amount of RAM used by the information store code and its related
data. When memory is reserved, it does not free until the process is stopped and
restarted; however, if Windows NT swaps some of these pages from RAM to disk,
the performance monitor value will decrease to reflect the change in the amount
of RAM being used by the information store.

This is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This memory is just reserved, not allocated. If the server is under stress from
another application, these pages will be swapped to the page file to free up
RAM, which will reduce the Working Set size.
