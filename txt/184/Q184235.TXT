TITLE   :PRB: LNK2005 Errors on New and Delete When Defining _ATL_MIN_CRT
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler

KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbActiveX kbLinker kbVC500 kbVC600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you compile an Active Template Library (ATL) executable (.exe) project in
Developer Studio, the _ATL_MIN_CRT preprocessor symbol allows you to use some
standard C library functions without having to link in the C run-time library
(CRT) startup code. If _ATL_MIN_CRT is defined when you build an ATL executable
with Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) support, the linker returns the
following linker errors:

   nafxcw.lib(afxmem.obj) : error LNK2005: "void * _cdecl operator new(unsigned
   int)" (??2@YAPAXI@Z) already defined in Stdafx.obj

   nafxcw.lib(afxmem.obj) : error LNK2005: "void __cdecl operator delete(void
   *)" (??3@YAXPAX@Z) already defined in StdAfx.obj

CAUSE
=====

Some C run-time library functions require that you provide the CRT startup code.
Because both the C run-time and MFC libraries contain definitions for the new
and delete operators, there is a conflict for the linker.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the _ATL_MIN_CRT preprocessor definition and rebuild the project. To do
this, click Settings on the Project menu. On the C/C++ tab, select the
Preprocessor category, and remove the _ATL_MIN_CRT definition.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create an ATL COM AppWizard application. On the File menu, click New, and
   select ATL COM AppWizard as the project type.

2. Use the information in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article to add
   MFC support to your ATL project:

   Q173974 HOWTO: Add MFC Support to an ATL Project

3. Add _ATL_MIN_CRT to your preprocessor definitions using the preprocessor
   settings described in the RESOLUTION section of this article.

4. On the Build menu, click Set Active Configuration, and choose the Win32
   Release MinSize configuration.

5. Build the project. You should see both LNK2005 errors in the build output
   window.
