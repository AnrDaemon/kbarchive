TITLE   :FP: Text in FrontPage Editor Looks Different in Browser
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:1.0; WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q194446.

SYMPTOMS
========

The text that is displayed on the Normal tab (at the bottom of the FrontPage
Editor window) may appear larger or smaller than the text that is displayed on
the Preview tab or when you preview the page in a Web browser.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs for either of the following reasons:

Case 1:   You used the Increase or Decrease Text Size Buttons. Both
          Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator support a maximum of
          four <Big> tags and two <Small> tags. FrontPage Editor does not
          have this limitation.  Increasing or decreasing the size of the
          text beyond these limits by using the Increase Text Size or
          Decrease Text Size buttons on the Formatting toolbar will cause
          the text to be displayed correctly in FrontPage Editor. However,
          the text will not be displayed correctly in a Web browser because
                               of this design limitation.

Case 2:   The default font size in the Web browser is configured
          differently than it is in FrontPage Editor.

RESOLUTION
==========

Case 1:   Use the Font command on the Format menu rather than the Increase
          or Decrease Text Size buttons. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Select the text you want to format.

2. On the Format menu, click Font.

3. In the Size box select or type the point size you want to use.

4. Click OK.

FrontPage will use the <FONT> tag with the SIZE attribute rather than the
<BIG> or <SMALL> tags. The text enclosed in the <FONT> tag
will be displayed similarly in both FrontPage Editor and the Web browser.

NOTE: After modifying the text using this procedure, you can use the Increase
Font Size and Decrease Font Size buttons to change the size of your font. In
this case, only the value of the SIZE attribute will be changed and the text
will be displayed correctly in both FrontPage Editor and the Web browser.

Case 2:   Change the default font size in your Web browser to match the
          size you are using in FrontPage Editor. To do this, use either of
          the following methods.

   Internet Explorer 4.0:

   1. Start Internet Explorer.

   2. On the View menu, point to Font, and click Medium.

   3. On the View menu, click Internet Options, and then click the General tab.

   4. Click Fonts.

   5. From the Proportional Font list, select Times New Roman.

   6. From the Fixed-Width Font list, select Courier.

   7. From the Font Size list, select Medium.

   Internet Explorer 3.0

   1. Start Internet Explorer.

   2. On the View menu, point to Fonts, and click Medium.

   3. On the View menu, click Options, and then click the General tab.

   4. Click Font Settings.

   5. From the Proportional Font list, select Times New Roman.

   6. From the Fixed-Width Font list, select Courier.
