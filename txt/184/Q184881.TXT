TITLE   :Reverse Lookups with BIND Earlier Than 4.8.3 Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If an application uses a version of BIND earlier than version 4.8.3 to do a
reverse lookup to identify a client, it may receive the following error
message:

   Unknown Host

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Domain Name System (DNS) servers do not have an equivalent to a BIND
directive called fake-iquery. If old BIND clients use Microsoft DNS servers, the
NSLOOKUP fails.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
