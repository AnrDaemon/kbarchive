TITLE   :Accessing Internet Site Shows Default Proxy Server Page
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT:2.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Proxy Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you access an Internet Web site via a browser configured to use Web Proxy,
the default page of Proxy Server version 2.0 is displayed while the requested
URL appears in the address line and in the title bar of the browser. This is
evident in Proxy Server computers with multiple netcards.

CAUSE
=====

There are multiple Web sites (default and any additional) created in the
Microsoft Management Console (MMC) of Internet Information Server version 4.0,
and the additional Web sites are configured to use the internal NIC IP
address(es). You may also get the default Proxy Server page if you have multiple
Web sites and the default Web site is set to use the external IP address.

WORKAROUND
==========

Change the IP address(es) of the additional Web site(s) to match an external
address, and set the default Web site to All Unassigned.

-OR-

Configure the additional Web site(s) to use All Unassigned, and then set the
default Web site to an internal IP address.

-OR-

Configure a new Web site to host the content in the default Web site and assign
it an external address.

NOTE: Whenever you modify the IP address of a Web site, it is recommended that
you stop and restart the Web site to ensure that the changes have been made.

To View the Web Site Properties, perform the following steps:

1. In the Microsoft Management Console, select the Servername icon and click the
   Action button.

2. Select Properties.

3. Modify the IP Address field to the desired setting.

To Create a New Web Site:

1. In the Microsoft Management Console, select the Servername icon and click the
   Action button.

2. Select New/Web Site.

3. Follow the instructions in the New Web Site Wizard.

MORE INFORMATION
================

As a general practice, it is recommended that you do not use the default Web
site as your main Web page location. Instead, create a new site in the Microsoft
Management Console, host your information there, and assign it the desired IP
address setting.
