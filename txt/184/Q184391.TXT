TITLE   :XADM: Event 1029 Occurs When Migrating cc:Mail Users
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to migrate a user from cc:Mail using the Exchange 5.5 Migration
Wizard, the migration may fail and the event log will contain an event 1029 with
the following text:

   Invalid Token '6' found in the exported file. Token should have been
   'Message:'. Account '<lastname>, <firstname>' did not migrate
   successfully.

CAUSE
=====

Export.exe (a cc:Mail executable) is used to extract user information from the
cc:Mail mailbox. The Exchange Migration Wizard uses the output files produced by
Export.exe to perform the migration. The Exchange Migration Wizard assumes all
information blocks in the exported file will be separated by a carriage-return
line-feed <CR><LF>. This assumption is incorrect.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server 5.0 and 5.5. 
This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2.  To
resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
