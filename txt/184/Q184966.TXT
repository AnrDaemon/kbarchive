The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Golf 1999 Edition, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To use the high-resolution golf courses when you play Microsoft Golf , you must
install a display adapter that supports 16-bit color (High Color) in your
computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you start Golf, the program automatically attempts to switch your
computer's display settings to 800 x 600 screen resolution and 16-bit High
Color. If your display adapter cannot dynamically switch display settings, you
may experience problems such as a black screen.

To prevent these problems, configure your display settings to match those used by
Golf before you start Golf. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Display.

3. Click the Settings tab.

4. Move the Display Area slider to the 800 x 600 position.

5. In the Color Palette box, click High Color (16-bit).

6. Click OK. If you are prompted to restart the computer, do so.

If High Color (16-bit) is not an available selection in the Color Palette box,
contact your hardware manufacturer to inquire if an updated video driver that
supports a 16-bit color palette is available for your video adapter.
