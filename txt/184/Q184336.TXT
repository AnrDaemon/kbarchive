TITLE   :XCLN: Message Format Unavailable After Outlook 98 Is Installed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::98
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 98 Deployment Kit 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After installing Microsoft Outlook 98 through the Outlook Deployment Kit Wizard,
the drop-down list to change the message format options on the Mail Format tab
(click Options on the Tools menu) is no longer available.


CAUSE
=====

The administrator that created the Outlook install packages with the Outlook
Deployment Kit (ODK) locked down the Mail Format setting by choosing the mail
format before creating the install packages.

An option in the fifth stage (Customize User Settings Stage) of the ODK allows
the administrator to lock down the Mail Format setting for users. This setting
is titled "Corporate/WorkGroup Mail Editor" for Corporate or Workgroup (CW)
Support or "Internet Only Mail Editor" for Internet Mail Only (IMO) Support.
These settings are in the Outlook 98/Email section in the option tree in the
left pane of this dialog box.

Administrators can select from the following four options:

 - HTML

 - Microsoft Outlook Rich Text

 - Plain Text

 - Microsoft Word

RESOLUTION
==========

Administrators that want to allow users to change this setting must leave the
Message Format option blank. When Outlook 98 is installed, the user will be able
to change the message format.
