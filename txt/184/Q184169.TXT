TITLE   :SMS: SMSEXEC Dr. Watson Error During Package Distribution
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:smsinst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Systems Management Server Executive service (Smsexec.exe) a Dr.
Watson occurs on the primary site server during a package distribution, if a
NetWare logon and/or distribution server has insufficient disk space to receive
the package.

The Systems Management Server site server Event Log will log Event ID 109:

      Component = SMS_Despooler
      Operation = Install
      Object = Package
      Error Code = 1
      Note: Failed to install package. There isn't sufficient disk space
      available on that server. Disk space available on that server is Y
      megabytes, space required is Z megabytes.

WORKAROUND
==========

To prevent the error from occurring, you must make sufficient space available on
each target NetWare server. Sufficient disk space is required for the package to
be successfully distributed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
