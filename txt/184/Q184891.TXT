TITLE   :Server.HTMLEncode Garbles Extended Characters
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

ASP script using Server.HTMLEncode produces garbled extended characters in
single-byte character set (SBCS) code pages other than code page 1252 (U.S.
ANSI).

This affects Eastern European languages, such as Czechoslovakian, Russian, and
Hungarian.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur due to both of the following causes:

 - HTMLEncode incorrectly writes numeric character entities using SBCS codepoint
   values instead of the Unicode values. In HTML, &#xxx; entities represent
   Unicode values, not SBCS codepoints. When HTMLEncode determines that a
   numeric entity must be written, it must simply write the raw Unicode value in
   decimal, not the local code page equivalent.

   -and-

 - HTMLEncode uses the wrong logic in determining when to write out a numeric
   character entity versus simply inserting the raw character. It appears to do
   the opposite of what is expected; it writes the incorrect character entities
   for characters that can be represented in Session.Codepage, and writes the
   nearest precomposed equivalent for other characters.

Instead, it should write the raw SBCS character for characters that can be
represented in Session.Codepage, and the Unicode numeric character entity for
characters that cannot.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
