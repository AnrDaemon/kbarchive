SUMMARY
=======

Hotfix.exe is a utility used in the installation of Windows NT hotfixes. A
hotfix is a collection of one or more files that can be applied to a system in
order to correct a problem.

Hotfix.exe supports the following switches:

HOTFIX [-y] [-f] [-n] [-z] [-q] [-m] [-l]

   -y Perform uninstall (only with -m or -q)
   -f Force apps closed at shutdown
   -n Do not create uninstall directory
   -z Do not reboot when update completes
   -q Quiet or Unattended mode with no user interface
   (this switch is a superset of -m)
   -m Unattended mode with user interface
   -l List installed hotfixes

To view the available switches, type one of the following at a command prompt:

      hotfix /?
      hotfix /help
      hotfix /h

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install a Windows NT hotfix, information about the hotfix is stored in
the registry in the following key:

   
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Hotfix\<KBArticleNumber>

   where <KBArticleNumber> is the Q number of a Microsoft Knowledge Base
   article associated with a particular hotfix.

IMPORTANT: At the end of the installation process, you may be prompted to restart
your computer.

The installation of a hotfix also stores uninstall information in a hidden folder
called %SystemRoot%\$NtUninstall<KBArticleNumber>$.

Perform the following steps to uninstall a Windows NT hotfix:

1. Extract the files within the hotfix. To do this, copy the original file to a
   temporary folder and type the name of the hotfix with the "/x" switch. For
   example, to extract a hotfix called HotfixA without installing the files,
   type the following at a command prompt: hotfixa /x

2. Type the following at a command prompt: hotfix -y

If multiple hotfixes replace the same file, you must remove the most recently
installed hotfix first in order to successfully return your system to its
original state. For example, assume HotfixA and HotfixB replace the same file
and that you install HotfixA before you install HotfixB. If you want to return
your system to the state prior to the installation of HotfixA, you must
uninstall HotfixB before you uninstall HotfixA.

NOTE: Chaining multiple hotfixes together for installation at the same time is
not supported. Dependencies and timing issues can result in the hotfixes not
being installed correctly.

Hotfix.exe is included with each hotfix you download from the Microsoft ftp site
(ftp.microsoft.com). You can also obtain the latest version of Hotfix.exe from
the following location:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/utilities/hotfix/
