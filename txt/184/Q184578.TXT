TITLE   :XADM: Online Backup Fails to Remove Log Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The log files are usually deleted after you perform a full online backup. If the
log files fail to be deleted, check the Application event log and look for the
following event:

   Event ID: 61
   Source:   EDB
   Type:     Error
   Category: Logging/Recovery

   Description: MSExchangeIS ((275) ) Unable to write a shadowed
   header for file d:\exchsrvr\MDBDATA\edb.chk.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs and the event is written in the event log because there is
corruption in the .chk file.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem, use the following steps:

1. Stop all of the Exchange services.

2. Move the .chk file out of the Mdbdata directory.

3. Restart the services.

Performing these steps causes the information store to play through all of the
log files and then create a new .chk file. When the steps have been completed,
perform a full online backup and the log files will be deleted.
