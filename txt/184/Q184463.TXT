TITLE   :XFOR: Cannot Connect to Server with POP3 Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may be unable to connect to a computer running Microsoft Exchange Server
with a Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) or Internet Messaging Access
Protocol 4 (IMAP) e-mail client. No error messages are displayed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when your Microsoft Exchange Server mailbox name is
different from your Windows NT user name and you do not specify both names in
the properties for the Microsoft Exchange Server information service. If you do
not specify both names, the Microsoft Exchange Server computer may be unable to
authenticate your user account and password.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, specify your Windows NT domain, Windows NT user name,
and Microsoft Exchange Server mailbox name in the properties for the Microsoft
Exchange Server information service. To do so, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu in your e-mail client, click Services.

2. Click Microsoft Exchange Server in the list of information services, and then
   click Properties.

3. In the Mailbox box, type

   "<domain>\<username>\<mailbox>" (without the quotation
   marks)

where <domain> is your Windows NT domain, <username> is your Windows
NT user name, and <mailbox> is your Microsoft Exchange Server mailbox
name. For example, type:

   "Domain1\User1\Mailbox1" (without the quotation marks)

4. Click OK, and then click OK again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you specify your mailbox name in the properties for the Microsoft Exchange
Server information service, but do not specify your domain and user name, the
computer running Microsoft Exchange Server assumes that your user name is the
same as your mailbox name. If it is not, the server is unable to locate your
user account.

If you specify the domain and user name, but do not specify the mailbox name, the
server assumes that your mailbox name is the same as your user name. If it is
not, the server is unable to locate your mailbox.
