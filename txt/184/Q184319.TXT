TITLE   :FTP Service's DefaultLogonDomain Not Available in MMC
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The FTP Service's DefaultLogonDomain is not available in the Microsoft
Management Console (MMC).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, manually add DefaultLogonDomain to the FTP Service
in the MMC. To do this, you can use either of the following:

 - The Metaedit.exe utility, included with the IIS 4.0 Resource Kit.

   -or-

 - The Adsutil.vbs utility that is included with IIS 4.0.

   NOTE: By default, Adsutil.vbs is located in the
   <%SystemRoot%>\System32\Inetsrv\Adminsamples folder. Also, you must
   first install the Windows Script Host before using Adsutil.vbs. For more
   information on using Adsutil.vbs, see below.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Specific Instructions for Using Adsutil.vbs
-------------------------------------------

Run Adsutil.vbs from a command prompt, using the appropriate syntax below
(depending on whether you want to set DefaultLogonDomain for all FTP sites, just
the default FTP site, or other sites):

 - To set DefaultLogonDomain for all FTP sites, run the following command:

   " adsutil set msftpsvc/DefaultLogonDomain "DomainName" " (without the
   quotation marks)

 - To set DefaultLogonDomain for only the default FTP site, run the following
   command:

   " adsutil set msftpsvc/1/DefaultLogonDomain "DomainName" " (without the
   quotation marks)

   NOTE: If the command listed above, which uses the Adsutil utility, fails, you
   can use the following command instead, which uses the Mdutil utility from the
   Windows NT Option Pack compact disc:

   " mdutil.exe set /msftpsvc/1/DefaultLogonDomain "DomainName" " (without the
   quotation marks)

 - To set DefaultLogonDomain for any other site, use the same syntax as the
   default FTP site above, but change the "1" parameter to the appropriate
   service number.
