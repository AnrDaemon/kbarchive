SYMPTOMS
========

When you create an "All Day Event" using the Microsoft Outlook Web Access
client, the appointment appears to span two days. The start time appears as
12:00 A.M. on the scheduled day and the end time appears as 12:00 A.M. on the
following day.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. When you select an All day Event, the default setting is
12:00 A.M. of the scheduled day to 12:00 A.M. of the following day, spanning a
full 24 hour period.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When an appointment is set as an All Day Event, its title is displayed in a
heading bar at the top of the schedule window.
