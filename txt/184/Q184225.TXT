TITLE   :XADM: Cannot Specify Destination Server Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to restore the information store from a backup tape to a
different server, the Destination Server box on the Restore Information dialog
defaults to the original server name and does not allow you to make changes. The
Erase All Existing Data option, the Private option, and the Public option are
dimmed.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs if you selected both the directory service and the
information store to be restored.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem, select only the Information Store option.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you need to restore the information store to a server other than the one used
for backup, you must change the name of the destination server. When you choose
both the directory service and the information store to be restored, the Restore
Information dialog has two pages. One is the preferences for the directory
service and the other is the preferences for the information store. Note that
the group box title is "Set 1 of 2" for the directory store. This group box does
not allow changes.
