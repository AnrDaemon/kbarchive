TITLE   :XFOR: Backup Exec Event ID 3004 When Backing Up LinkAge
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2,4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - LinkAge Message Exchange, version 3.2 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This article applies to LinkAge version 3.2 Notes, and the OV/VM and/or SNADS
connectors.

The following error message appears in the Windows NT Event Viewer application
log:

   The description for Event ID (3004) in Source (Backup Exec 6.1) could
   not be found. It contains the following insertion string(s):
   \\USTCAX02\C$\linkage\tables\NOTES.PAB.

NOTE: some of the parameters in the error message may be different, depending on
the type of connector, specific filenames, location on the disk, and so on.

CAUSE
=====

When running incremental backups, Backup Exec tries to access the files (in this
example Notes.pab) which may be in use by one of the LinkAge processes. Backup
Exec is unable to access the locked file and the above errors are logged.

WORKAROUND
==========

To eliminate the problem, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, select Services.

2. Select the LinkAge Controller service, and click Stop. That will shut down
   all the LinkAge connector services as well.

3. Perform the backup.

Alternatively, add the LinkAge Controller service to the list of tasks shut down
by the backup software.

MORE INFORMATION
================

   the last time they were backed up.
