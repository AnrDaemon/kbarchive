TITLE   :ASP Searches Return Documents from Non-indexed Directories
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform searches using the sample Active Server Pages (ASP) query page,
the search results may contain documents from directories marked as unindexed.
The links returned for these hits will be non-functional.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by an error in the sample Query.asp code shipped with Index
Server.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you must modify the Query.asp code so that the
formscope is correctly set.

In the sample Query.asp file, the following code needs to be modified:

      if FormScope <> "/" then
         util.AddScopeToQuery Q, FormScope, "deep"
      end if

The "/" on the first line must be changed to "\". After this has been done, the
queries should work correctly.

This problem only occurs when you are using the ASP index object. If you are
using the ADO ODBC provider for Index Server, or .htm, .idq, or .htx files, you
should not have this problem.
