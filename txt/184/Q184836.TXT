TITLE   :Application Access Violates When Session Is Terminated
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

An application being run from a file server terminates with an access violation
for no apparent reason.

CAUSE
=====

The redirector is sending a LogoffAndX SMB to terminate a virtual circuit to a
file server while there is still at least one active TreeConnect to the server.
As a result any existing files that are being held open by the workstation on
the server become invalid. If an application is being run on the workstation
which uses DLLs held on the file server, it can no longer access the DLLs it
requires and will probably cause an Access Violation.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
