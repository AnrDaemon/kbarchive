TITLE   :Paste Link Function Is Not Available Between WordPad Documents
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to create a "paste link" (a method for pasting information from one
document to another using Object Linking and Embedding, OLE) between two
Microsoft WordPad documents, you are unable to do so.

CAUSE
=====

The ability to create a "paste link" requires an OLE server program. Because
WordPad is not an OLE server program, it does not support the "paste link"
functionality.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, do not try to create a paste link between two Microsoft
WordPad documents.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
