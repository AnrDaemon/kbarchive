TITLE   :XFOR: Attendees Missing from Migrated Groupwise Meeting
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you migrate users and meetings from Novell GroupWise to Microsoft Exchange
Server, no meeting attendees are migrated. The missing attendees may include
user accounts and other resource accounts that were successfully migrated to
Exchange Server.

CAUSE
=====

When users and meetings are migrated from GroupWise to Exchange Server, the
GroupWise source extractor is used to copy the desired information from the
GroupWise post office to migration files. The Migration Wizard is then used to
import the migration files to Exchange Server. Meeting attendees are not
included in the migration files. Therefore, they are not migrated to Exchange
Server when you import the migration files.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information about obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base

MORE INFORMATION
================

The GroupWise source extractor migrates calendar information by creating a
Schedule+ Interchange (.sc2) file for each user. Each .sc2 file contains the
information from that user's calendar. When the Migration Wizard is used to
import the migration files to Exchange Server, a Calendar Attachments folder is
created in the user's Inbox folder. This new folder contains a message for each
meeting that has been accepted. If a meeting contains an attachment, the
attachment is included with the associated message in the Calendar Attachments
folder. In addition, a message is created in the Inbox folder for each meeting
that has not been accepted.

When you apply the fix described in this article, the attendees that are listed
on the To, From, Cc, and Bcc lines in the GroupWise meeting appear in the
associated message in the Calendar Attachments or Inbox folder. Users and
resources are both included and are listed separately. All invited users and
resources are listed, even if they did not accept the meeting. Text indicating
that some of the attendees that are listed may not have accepted the meeting is
also included in the message.
