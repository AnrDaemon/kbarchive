TITLE   :XFOR: Queued Message Waiting for ETRN Never Expires
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Normally, when a message sent from a client is undelivered after the scheduled
time (message time-out value), the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Service
expires the message on the Internet Mail Service outbound queue and returns a
non-delivery report (NDR) to the sender. However, when this problem occurs, the
queued message, which is waiting for the ETRN command, remains in the outgoing
queue and never expires after the scheduled time. The sender never receives an
NDR.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Exchange Server supports the use of an SMTP extension called ETRN. An
Exchange Server computer can be used as a host SMTP server and will respond to
ETRN commands from the remote host. After the remote host submits the ETRN
command to the Exchange Server computer, a new connection is established from
the Exchange Server computer to the remote host. The Exchange Server computer
keeps a message until it receives the ETRN command from the remote host. If the
queued message is waiting for the ETRN command, the message never expires even
after the scheduled time. Then the sender never receives an NDR. The scheduled
time is 48 hours for Normal Message by default.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.
