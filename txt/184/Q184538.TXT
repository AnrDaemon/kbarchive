TITLE   :Error Message: A Controller for This Domain Could Not Be Found
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to add computers to a domain during Windows NT Setup after you
have installed the updated Lsasrv.dll file (Lsa-fixi.exe or Lsa- ixa.exe) on the
Primary Domain Controller (PDC), you may receive the following error message:

   A controller for this domain could not be found.

CAUSE
=====

The behavior occurs because the updated Lsasrv.dll file (Lsa-fixi.exe or
Lsa-fixa.exe) implements the new registry item called RestrictAnonymous that
restricts the use of Null NamedPipes. Windows NT Setup uses a Null NamedPipe for
the connection to the server to verify the domain. The Null NamedPipe is
returned with access denied because RestrictAnonymous has been used on the PDC.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.


MORE INFORMATION
