TITLE   :XADM: Unable to Connect to Server, Licenses Still Available
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to a Microsoft Exchange Server computer, you may
receive an error message indicating that there are no more client access
licenses available. This problem occurs even though the number of users
connected to the server does not exceed the number of client access licenses
that have been added on the server.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when the "Not for Resale" (NFR) version of Microsoft
Windows NT Server or the version of Windows NT Server that is included with the
Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) is installed on the computer running Exchange
Server. The NFR version of Windows NT Server is limited to five users and the
version of Windows NT Server that is included with MSDN is limited to ten users.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, install the retail version of Windows NT Server.
For information about doing so, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q142391 Cannot Upgrade NFR or MSDN Windows NT 4.0 to Retail


MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine if you are running the NFR or MSDN version of Windows NT Server,
double-click Licensing in Control Panel. If you are running the NFR or MSDN
version of Windows NT Server, the following message is displayed:

   Not available in NFR (Not for Resale)/MSDN Edition of Windows NT
   Server.
