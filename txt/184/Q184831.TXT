SUMMARY
=======

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry. Before
you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if a problem
occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring the Registry"
Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key" Help topic in
Regedt32.exe.

This article explains how to disable the checkbox for "Logon Using Dial-Up
Networking" at the logon prompt on your Windows NT computer. This option
normally is available on the logon dialog box and allows you to dial into your
logon server for authentication of your user account.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To configure this option so that it is unavailable, use the following steps to
edit the registry:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), and select the following subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion
   \Winlogon

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

2. From the Edit menu, click Add Value, and type the following information:

   Value Name: RASDisable
   Data Type: REG_SZ
   Value: 1

If you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

NOTE: After you add this value, "Logon Using Dial-up Networking" will be
permanently unavailable.
