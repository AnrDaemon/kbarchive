DOCUMENT:Q184056  10-AUG-2001  [winnt]
TITLE   :Font Substitution List Is Not Loaded from Vendor PPD File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You install a PostScript printer with a vendor-supplied PPD file and notice
there is an incomplete list of fonts available for substitution. This list
appears when you select a font from the font substitution table in Device
Settings under properties for a PostScript printer.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is a result of the limited number of PostScript device fonts
supported by the Windows NT 4.0 PostScript driver. If the PPD file specifies a
device font that is not part of the approximately 80 fonts known to the driver,
the driver cannot use that font.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post additional information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
