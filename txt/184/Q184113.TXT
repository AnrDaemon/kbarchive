TITLE   :XCON: Content Conversion Fails After Repeated Replies
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A user sends a message in Rich Text Format (RTF) to a user on another Exchange
Server computer connected by an X.400 Connector with "Remote clients support
MAPI" configured. The second user replies to the message, including the original
text, and also using RTF. The original user then replies to this reply, again
including the message. After several replies (the number depends on the amount
of data exchanged), one of the recipients receives a non-delivery report (NDR)
with Reason = Unable to Transfer, and Diagnostic = A syntax error was detected
in the content of the message. The message transfer agent (MTA) that generated
the NDR is an Exchange Server 5.0 SP2 MTA, and it will have reported a Content
Conversion Failure (Event ID 290).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the following fix by contacting Microsoft
Technical Support or wait for the next Exchange Server service pack.
