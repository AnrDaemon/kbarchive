TITLE   :WordPerfect Suite 6.0 Setup Fails with Multiple CD-ROMs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During the installation of Corel WordPerfect Suite 6.0 on a system with multiple
CD-ROM drive letters, Setup will return the following error message:

   General Protection Fault in krnl386.exe

This problem only happens if there is more than one CD-ROM drive letter present.

CAUSE
=====

Like many applications, Corel's Setup program calls Int2f 1500 first, which
returns the count of CD-ROM drive letters and the first drive letter. Corel goes
a step further and calls Int2f 150d, passing a pointer to a buffer in ES:bx to
receive a byte array of the CD-ROM drive "letters" (A=0,and so on). This is
where the problem occurs; the Windows NT DPMI server does not translate buffers
for MSCDEX calls in protective mode. Instead, the interrupt is reflected to v86
mode with whatever ES register happened to be in the v86-mode state from the
last time it transitioned to PM. So, some random bit of the low 1 MB of memory
(often krnl386 or ntdos code or data) is replaced with the sequence of drive
letters.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
