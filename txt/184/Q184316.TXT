TITLE   :Unable to Return Custom HTML Properties in Result Set
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to return the value of custom HTML properties on the .htx results
page, no error message appears, but no data is displayed for the property value.

CAUSE
=====

In order for custom HTML property values to be displayed, these properties must
be added to the properties cache. This cannot be done with Index Server 1.x.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to the Windows NT Option Pack. This contains
Index Server 2.0, which allows custom HTML properties to be cached.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Index Server allows you to create custom properties for META tags within HTML
documents. You can then query on the contents of these tags but not display the
contents.
