SYMPTOMS
========

the services configuration database.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Normally, services use the same name for the APPID as it does for the Services
display name and does not use the CLSID. So, when this name change in the
services configuration database occurs, it is transparent.
