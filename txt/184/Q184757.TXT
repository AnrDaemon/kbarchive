TITLE   :Programs on Pan-Chinese Windows NT May Use Fixed Font for Menus
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Programs installed on the Pan Chinese localized (foreign language) version of
Windows NT may not use the proper font (typically the Tahoma font) for their
menus. Instead, the program's menus may use a non-proportional font that looks
like Courier rather than a proportional font similar to Arial. This may cause
the menus to be truncated or not visible in some programs, making them difficult
or impossible to use.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the charset is set to 86 (GB2312). Because of this,
CreateFontIndirect() returns the SimSun font as the closest match for the
requested Tahoma font.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Technical Support to obtain the
following fix, or wait for the next Windows NT service pack.
