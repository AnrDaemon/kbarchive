PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A computer running both Windows NT Server and Novell's NDS for Windows NT cannot
be configured to restrict anonymous connections.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 and a hotfix for Windows NT 3.51 provide a
mechanism for administrators to restrict the ability for anonymous logon users
from obtaining system information. These are also known as NULL session
connections. During the installation of Novell NDS, SamSrv.dll is replaced and
support for this feature is not included.

STATUS
======

Novell NDS for Windows NT currently does not include support for restricting
anonymous connections
