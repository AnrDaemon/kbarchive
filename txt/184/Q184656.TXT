PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdisplay kbenv kbimu msgame

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outwars, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you play Outwars, you may occasionally move through a solid object or get
stuck inside a solid object, or the graphics in the game may be slow or jumpy.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Quit all programs that are running on your computer.

2. Start Outwars.

3. On the startup screen, click Options.

4. On the Options screen, click Graphics.

If a Direct3D-compatible 3D accelerator card is installed in the computer, follow
these steps:

1. Click the Use Direct3D box to light it.

2. Click the up or down arrow to select the Direct3D driver you want to use. If
   the computer has only one display adapter, Display is the only item in the
   list of available Direct3D drivers. If you install an add-on Direct3D
   accelerator card or an additional display adapter, Outwars adds it to the
   list of available Direct3D drivers.

   NOTE: When you enable Direct3D hardware acceleration, some lighting effects in
   Outwars may not work.

3. Click Back, and then click Back again.

4. Start a single player mission. If the issue continues to occur, disable
   Fogging. For information about how to disable Fogging in Outwars, see the
   following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

If a Direct3D-compatible 3D accelerator card is not installed in the computer,
follow these steps:

1. In the Scene Detail box, click the Medium box or the Low box to light it.

2. In the Resolution box, click the down arrow to select a lower screen
   resolution.

3. Click Back, and then click Back again.

4. Start a single player mission. If the issue continues to occur, cancel the
   mission, and then repeat these steps to select a lower scene detail setting
   or resolution.

If the issue continues to occur, contact your hardware manufacturer to inquire
about obtaining the latest version of the driver for your display adapter or 3D
accelerator card.
