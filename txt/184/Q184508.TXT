-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If a print session is configured to use a PDT file, then a recompilation may be
required, using the version of PDFCOMP.EXE that is distributed with a new
service pack. Unpredictable results may occur if PDT files compiled with
PDFCOMP.EXE from earlier service packs are used on a newer service pack level.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To compile the PDF, enter the following command line:

   " pdfcomp <PDFfile> <PDTfile.PDT>" (without the quotation marks)

You must use the extension .PDT for the SNA Server Manager to find the file. If
you do not specify a path, PDFCOMP.EXE will write the PDT file in the current
folder. Optionally, create a folder to hold your PDTs and add that path to the
PDT file name. The first time you select a PDT file in SNA Server Manager, it
will look in the \SNA\SYSTEM folder. If you keep your PDT files elsewhere and
browse to your PDT folder, SNA Server Manager will remember that folder.
