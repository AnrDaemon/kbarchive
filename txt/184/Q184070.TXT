TITLE   :XCLN: URL Opened in Outlook Today Starts Internet Explorer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:98
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 98 Deployment Kit 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Outlook 98, when you open a Web link that is a Uniform Resource
Locator (URL) added to the Outlook Today view, the link appears to open
Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0, even though you use another program as your
default Web browser.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior for Outlook 98 is by design. Although it appears that Internet
Explorer 4.0 is opened, the link is actually being accessed using an embedded
HTML rendering control that is based on Internet Explorer 4.0 technology.

The use of this browser control within Outlook 98 does not change your default
browser for accessing Web links in other situations.

STATUS
======

Currently there is no procedure for using another browser within the Outlook
Today view.

WORKAROUND
==========

To open the Web link in your default browser, type it directly in to the
browser's command window, or access it from a source other than Outlook Today.
