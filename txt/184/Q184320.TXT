TITLE   :Using PATH_INFO and PATH_TRANSLATED from CGI Applications
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

CGI applications often use the HTTP variables PATH_INFO and PATH_TRANSLATED.
However, these may appear to work incorrectly in Internet Information Server
(IIS) version 4.0. These CGI environment variables return the physical path to
the file that was passed to the CGI application as part of the GET statement.
Instead, IIS returns the path to the CGI script.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design, for security purposes. PATH_INFO and PATH_TRANSLATED can be
used to get information about the physical makeup of the Web server and thus be
used to mount an attack against the server.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you want to use PATH_INFO and PATH_TRANSLATED as specified by the CGI
specification, then use the AllowPathInfoForScriptMappings property. This
property can be set using the Adsutil.vbs tool or the MetaEdit.exe tool, which
comes with the Internet Information Server 4.0 Resource Kit. Using this
property, you can set a Web server to allow or disallow the use of the
variables.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is an example:

1. Change to the following directory (depending on platform):

   Windows 2000: Drive:\inetpub\adminscripts
   Windows NT 4: Drive:\winnt\system32\inetsrv\adminsamples

2. Type the following:

   "adsutil set w3svc/AllowPathInfoForScriptMappings True (Sets at Master
   Properties Level)
   adsutil set w3svc/1/AllowPathInfoForScriptMappings True (Sets at WebSite
   Level)" (without the quotation marks)

For more information, refer to AllowPathInfoForScriptMappings in the online
documentation.
