TITLE   :XFOR: cc:Mail Connector Does Not Return Attachments On NDRs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the cc:Mail connector is unable to resolve a cc:Mail address, it sends an
NDR (non-delivery report) back to the sender. This NDR, however, is generic and
lists all the cc:Mail recipients. The NDR does not indicate which recipient
address is bad.

The NDR contains the following:

 - "This messages is From: cc:Mail Connector Interchange."

 - The subject line is the original subject line preceded by the text

 - "Undeliverable:"

 - A new text body is created to notify the user that the message could not be
   delivered to one or more recipient addresses.

 - The original text body of the messages is also attached to the messages.

 - All other text and file attachments are discarded.

In cc:Mail when a message is addressed to a non existent user at a remote
postoffice (PO), the message is forwarded to the remote PO, and may be rejected
prior to delivery by the cc:Mail router session that connects directly to that
remote PO. The message is returned to the sender with the following changes:

 - The "Forwarded by" (or From) block is changed to the user's name.

 - A forwarding history is created in the message to indicate the reason why the
   mail was returned.

 - The subject line is replaced by "Message not deliverable."

 - The original subject is contained in the forwarding history.

 - The message body is not changed.

The NDRs generated by cc:Mail back to the mailbox on the Exchange Server computer
list the unresolved recipients.
