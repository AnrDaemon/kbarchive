SUMMARY
=======

When you view the LDAP instance in the Microsoft Management Console, the
Distributed Password Authentication checkbox is unavailable (grayed out) and
unchecked in the Directory Security tab.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Distributed Password Authentication may be enabled for access to the Membership
Directory Service (more accurately, Distributed Password Authentication is
enabled for authentication to the LDAP server) using the command line
administration tool. The syntax is as follows:

PMADMIN SET LDAP /ID:<membership server instance ID#> /LDAPAUTH:<auth
type>

 - Where <membership server instance ID#> is the instance number of the
   membership server, underneath which the LDAP server chosen to be managed is
   found. (A list of membership server names and their instance ID numbers is
   available by using the following command: PMADMIN LIST INSTANCE).

 - Where <auth type> is an integer value for the type of authentication
   method. The valid integers are as follows:

      1=Anonymous
      2=Cleartext
      4=NTLM/DPA

These values are OR'ed together so any combination may be configured by setting
the sum of the integer values (7=all types). Note that 4 enables Challenge
Response, which is interpreted automatically as NTLM if the Membership Directory
Service is configured for Windows NT authentication mode, and Distributed
Password Authentication is configured for Membership authentication mode.

NOTE: When you enable the Distributed Password Authentication via command line,
it should display as enabled from the Microsoft Management Console graphical
user interface (GUI); however, to disable the setting, you must use the command
line.
