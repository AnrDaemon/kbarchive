TITLE   :WD97: Word Creates Hyperlink When @ Is Inside Quotation Marks
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta kbconversion WordCon kbhtml word97 kbconvert

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A hyperlink is created in Word when text enclosed in quotation marks contains
the at sign (@), and you type a character after the closing quotation mark.

CAUSE
=====

The AutoCorrect feature is interpreting this as an irregular URL (Universal
Resource Locator) and removes the quotation marks and creates a hyperlink using
the text inside the quotation marks.

WORKAROUND
==========

Immediately after the hyperlink is created, you can undo it by pressing the
BACKSPACE key, by pressing CONTROL+Z, or by clicking Undo on the Edit menu. Any
of these actions will remove the hyperlink and leave the text in place.

To disable the AutoCorrect feature, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click AutoCorrect.

2. On the "AutoFormat as you type" tab, under "Replace as you type," click to
   clear the "Internet and network paths with hyperlinks" check box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior allows you to automatically create hyperlinks that contain spaces
and some other non-standard characters or non-standard formatting, such as two
'at' signs (@), by enclosing them in quotation marks.
