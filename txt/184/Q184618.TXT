TITLE   :Number 2 Automatically Appended to New Virtual Directory Name

SYMPTOMS
========

After creating a new virtual directory, the directory name is displayed with an
appended number 2.

If you attempt to rename the file and remove the number 2 from the name, you may
receive the following error message:

   A virtual directory already exists with that name.

CAUSE
=====

There is a reference in the metabase to a physical directory with the same name
as the new virtual directory.

The Microsoft Management Console (MMC) detects the entries in the metabase for
that same directory name, and automatically appends the number 2 to the name of
the new virtual directory, to avoid duplicate names.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, modify the properties of the original physical
directory so that it becomes a virtual directory, which then points to the
correct path. To do this, perform the following steps:

1. Delete the virtual directory that has the number 2 appended to it.

2. Re-create the physical directory.

3. On the Action menu, click Refresh.

4. View the properties of the directory.

5. Click the Browse button next to the Local Path text box, select the path that
   you want the new virtual directory to point to, and click OK.

   NOTE: The new path is not displayed in the New Path text box as you would
   expect.

6. On the Action menu, click Refresh.
