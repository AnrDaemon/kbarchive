TITLE   :WD97: Send Command Sends Attachment as Word 97 Document
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Send To command on the File menu, the current document is
attached as a Word 97 document even if you saved the file in a non-Word 97
format.

NOTE: This problem occurs when you "Send to" any of the following:

 - Mail Recipient

 - Routing Recipient

 - Public Folder

 - Fax Recipient (Class 1 Fax Modems Only)

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when the Mail As Attachment option is selected on the
General tab in the Options dialog box (on the Tools menu, click Options).

WORKAROUND
==========

To send a file in a non-Word 97 format, save the file in that format and then
attach the file to your mail or fax message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Word 97, this also applies to files that are saved as previous versions of
Word unless your default save is set to that version. For example, if you open a
Word 6.0 document and click Send To on the File menu, the file will be sent in
Word 97 format unless your default save option (on the Tools menu, click Options
and click Save) is set to Word 6.0/95.

NOTE: This does not apply to documents sent with the Routing feature. Routing
always sends the documents in the Word 97 format.
