The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 98 
 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows 95 Explorer may stop responding (hang) when copying files or displaying
properties of a folder or files that reside on distributed file system (Dfs)
shares.

CAUSE
=====

The client is sending a FindFirst SMB to \\DfsServer\RootShare with a path of
\\DfsServer\RootShare. The server incorrectly responds with DFS_PATH_NOT_FOUND
error.

This response causes a loop to occur between the DFS driver and the vredir on the
Windows 95 client.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
