SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to a Web page using a shortcut icon on your desktop,
the Web page may not be opened or you may receive the following error message:

   Microsoft VBScript runtime error [Line: 29]

   Object doesn't support this property or method.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the shortcut icon on your desktop was not properly
created.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Connect to MSN, and then navigate to the Web page for which you want to
   create a shortcut.

2. Right-click the Web page, and then click Create Shortcut.

3. When you are prompted that a shortcut to the current page will be placed on
   your desktop, click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior occurs when you create a shortcut icon by saving a Web page as an
.htm file instead of using this method. The shortcut icon you create in this way
links only to a local copy of the source code of the Web page and does not link
to the Web page over the Internet.

Additional query words: msnet msnetwork microsoft-net m.s.n.
