TITLE   :Rchelp.sys Causes a STOP Error at Boot on WinNT Clients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.2 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After installing Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 3 (SP3), a client
computer may display the following STOP error message at startup:

   STOP: c000026c {Unable to Load Device Driver}
   \<SystemRoot>\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\RCHELP.SYS device driver could not be
   loaded. Error Status was oxc000012f

The computer will no longer complete the boot process and stops responding on
this error message each time you attempt to start it.

CAUSE
=====

The failure occurs because the \<SystemRoot>\System32\Drivers\Rchelp.sys
file was not properly generated when Service Pack 3 was installed on the client.
