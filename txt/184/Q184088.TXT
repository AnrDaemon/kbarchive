======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 4.0, 4.0a, 4.1 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The comment pragma allows the user to insert strings into an executable. If a
comma is used in the comment string, as follows:

   #pragma comment(exestr,"This is a , comma")

then the linker generates the following warning:

   warning LNK4056: extra arguments ignored for option
   "/comment:This is a , comma"

where the "extra arguments" refers to the text after the "," in the comment
string.

CAUSE
=====

The comment pragma is translated by the compiler into the /comment linker
option. The linker interprets the comma as a separator between arguments, and
ignores the "second" argument.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add a space or some other character in place of the comma, and then edit the
executable and replace the space with a comma. To do this, open the executable
file in Developer Studio using the binary format. Select File/Open, choose
Binary under the "Open As" combo box, and open the .exe file. Locate the string,
and edit the executable directly to add a comma where needed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual C++ 6.0.
