PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT:1.0,2.0

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server version 2.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Microsoft Windows NT Option Pack Setup program on a computer
running Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 95 with the regional settings set to Turkish,
the following error message appears:

   Microsoft Index Server setup internal error: can't get version.

CAUSE
=====

The Setupapi.dll file is unable to process the "I" character. As a result, Setup
cannot find the version string in the Is20.inf.

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: You must copy the contents of the Microsoft Windows NT Option Pack (NTOP)
compact disc to your local hard disk and replace the Setupapi.dll file that
ships with Windows NT Option Pack version 1.0 with the hotfix.

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to computers
experiencing this specific problem. If you are not severely affected by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next service pack.
