   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to access your mailbox using the Outlook Web Access client, the
following error messages may be displayed:

   Unable to Render View

   -or-

   Unable to Render This View

CAUSE
=====

Incorrect security permissions are set on the following registry keys:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\currentcontrolset\services\MsExchangeweb

   - and -

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\currentcontrolset\services\W3SVC

RESOLUTION
==========

Other settings that should be checked are the permissions on the following
directories on the Microsoft Outlook Web Access server:

   \Exchsrvr\Res directory

   \Exchsrvr\bin directory

In both of the above cases, the Everyone group should have Full Control.

If correcting the above permissions does not correct the "Unable to Render View"
problem, follow these steps to reregister the cdo.dll and cdohtml.dll files.

1. Stop the IIS Admin service, which stops the following services (if they are
   running):

    - World Wide Web Publishing Service

    - Microsoft SMTP Service

    - Microsoft NNTP Service

    - FTP Publishing Service

2. Reregister Cdo.dll and Cdohtml.dll by typing the following syntax at a
   command prompt:

   "regsvr32 c:\winnt\system32\cdo.dll" (without the quotation marks)

   - and then -

   "regsvr32 c:\exchsrvr\bin\cdohtml.dll" (without the quotation marks)

NOTE: The paths for the Cdo.dll and Cdohtml.dll files assume that these
directories are on drive C; if this is not the correct drive for your system,
change the drive letter of the path to point to the correct drive location of
the files.

If reregistering these libraries does not correct the problem, re-apply the most
recent Microsoft Exchange Server service pack.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To set the correct permissions for the above listed registry keys, do the
following:

1. Start the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Select the keys in the "Cause" section of this article, one at a time.

3. On the Security menu, click Permissions.

4. Click Add, and click Everyone.

5. Click Full to change the permission to full, and then click OK.

6. Click to select the Replace Permission on Existing Subkeys check box, and
   then click OK.

7. Stop the Exchange Server services, and restart the computer.
