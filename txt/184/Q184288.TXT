TITLE   :GP Fault May Occur with IIS on Multiprocessor System
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A general protection (GP) fault may occur with Internet Information Server (IIS)
when running on Windows NT 4.0, Service Pack 3 on a multi- processor system.
When this problem occurs, a dialog box appears, indicating an application
exception occurred in Inetinfo.exe. The exception number is 0xC0000005.

CAUSE
=====

During initialization of IIS, a security key pair is generated for secure socket
layer (SSL) connections. The security key may become corrupt if a client browser
connects to the IIS server before the generation of the key is complete. If the
key is corrupted, a subsequent SSL request using the key may cause the general
protection fault.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

version 4.0. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0
and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 4.
