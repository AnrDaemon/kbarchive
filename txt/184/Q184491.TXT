When you print the same document several times from a computer running Windows
NT 4.0 to a Windows NT 4.0 print server, some of the documents may be printed in
an incorrect font or in bold text.

   print server.

--------

Install the appropriate font on your print server.

Method 2
--------

Disable EMF spooling. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Right-click the appropriate printer, and then click Properties.

3. Click Print Processor.

4. Click the Always Spool RAW Datatype check box to select it, click OK, and
   then click OK again.
