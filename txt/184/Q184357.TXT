TITLE   :PRB: Visual C++ Opens Project in Wrong VSS Database
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe400 kbSSafe500 kbSSafe600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to open a workspace from source control, the wrong database is
displayed in the browse window.

CAUSE
=====

When you attempt to open a workspace from source control, Visual C++ opens the
database referenced by the following:

       HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SourceSafe = Value:    Current
       Database

RESOLUTION
==========

Visual C++ can be forced to browse for a different database by using one of the
two following methods:

 - Browsing for the correct database (from within the Visual SourceSafe
   Explorer) and selecting the "Open this database next time I run Visual
   SourceSafe" check box. This sets the path listed below to the desired VSS
   database:

          HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SourceSafe = Value:    Current
          Database

 - Force Visual C++ to prompt the user to choose the correct database. In
   Developer Studio, from the Tools menu, select Options. Select the Source
   Control tab and then click the Advanced button. Choose the Integration tab
   and select the Prompt radio button in the "Choose SourceSafe Database" group.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
