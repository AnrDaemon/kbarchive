SYMPTOMS
========

When you activate a modeless dialog box, such as the Find dialog box (click Find
on the Edit menu) in a Microsoft Word document opened in Microsoft Binder, the
dialog box appears in Microsoft Word rather than Microsoft Binder.

NOTE: A modeless dialog box is one that you can activate and switch away from by
clicking another active window. For example, you can click your document to
switch away from this type of dialog box and continue editing your document.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Word is opened in the background, and the same modeless dialog box is
being displayed in that session of Word.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

 - Close the dialog box in Word before opening Microsoft Binder.

   -or-

 - Minimize Word before you open Microsoft Binder.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

This problem has been corrected in Word 2000.
