KEYWORDS:kbListBox kbVBp kbVBp500bug kbVBp600bug kbOSWin98 kbGrpDSVBDB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a FileListBox has its Pattern property set to "*." there is a discrepancy
between how Windows 95 and other versions of Windows display the files. On
Windows 2000, Windows NT and Windows 98, only files without extensions are
displayed. However, on Windows 95, all files are shown.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Place a FileList box (File1) on Form1.

3. Place a CommandButton on Form1 and place the following code in the click
   event:

   File1.Path = "c:\" ' folder that contains files without extensions.
   File1.Pattern = "*."

4. Press the F5 key to run the application on Windows 95, and note that all the
   files are displayed in the FileListBox. Run the same application on Windows
   NT 4.0 or Windows 2000, and note that only files without extensions are
   displayed in the FileListBox. If you run the same application on Windows Me,
   "NULL" is displayed in a FileListBox.
