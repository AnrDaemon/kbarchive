SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the information store after a restore, a server specific error
3355443730 is generated.

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused by restoring either the Priv.edb file or the Pub.edb file
with BackupExec version 6.11 on a computer running Exchange Server 5.5 and not
restoring the entire information store.

WORKAROUND

When using BackupExec version 6.11 with Exchange Server 5.5, you must choose to

corrupting the log files.
