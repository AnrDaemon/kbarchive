======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outwars, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If another program minimizes Outwars while you are playing with other players,
you must switch back to the game within two minutes. If you do not switch back
to the game within two minutes, you are disconnected from the game. This is a
standard function of DirectPlay.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In most Outwars screens, you cannot switch from an Outwars multiplayer game to
another program by pressing ALT+TAB. In the Outwars chat window, you can press
ALT+TAB to switch to another program, but doing so may cause the game to stop
responding (hang).
