TITLE   :Copydbg.cmd Fails to Copy All of the Symbols from SP3 CD.
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Copydbg.cmd utility included on the Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 CD only
copies over the debugging components and their associated symbols to the
destination paths included in the command line. It does not copy over the entire
set of Service Pack 3 symbols to the destination path included in the command
line.

CAUSE
=====

The inclusion of the Copydbg.cmd on Windows NT 4.0, Service Pack 3 was intended
to pull the new build of some of the debugging modules included in the Service
Pack 3 and copy them and their associated symbols to the destination path
included in the command line:

For example, if your CD-ROM is drive E, your debugging tools are in D:\Mytools,
and your .DBG files are in C:\Winnt\Symbols, type the following:

   copydbg e: d:\mytools c:\winnt\symbols

RESOLUTION
==========

The Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 CD-ROM contains the Service Pack 3 symbols in
an uncompressed format in the following paths on the CD-ROM:

   "CD-ROM drive letter":\Support\Debug\I386\Symbols Intel
   "CD-ROM drive letter":\Support\Debug\Alpha\Symbols Alpha

For debugging purposes, the Service Pack 3 symbols can be used directly from the
above paths on the CD-ROM or copied over to appropriate destinations where the
debugger(s) are directed to look for symbols.
