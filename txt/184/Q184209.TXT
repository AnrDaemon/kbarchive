TITLE   :XADM: Error Msg: JET_errPageNotInitialized When Starting Store
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start the Microsoft Exchange information store service, the
following error message may be displayed on the screen or in the system log:

   The Microsoft Exchange Information Store service terminated with service-
   specific error 4294966277.

   Application log:

   Event ID: 0
   Source: ESE97
   Type: Error
   Category: Logging/Recovery

   Description: MSExchangeIS ((451)) -1019

   Event ID: 1120
   Source: MSExchangeIS
   Type Error
   Category: General

   Description: Error 0xfffffc05 initializing the Microsoft Exchange Server
   Information Store database.

   System log:

   Event ID: 7024
   Source: Service Control Manager
   Type: Error

   Description: The Microsoft Exchange Information Store service terminated
   with service-specific error 4294966277.

Also, when you try to repair the database, ESEUTIL may report:

 -1019 0xFFFFFC05 JET_errPageNotInitialized       Repair Only: Read an
 unused page  4294966277

This error message shows that the database is corrupt and needs to be restored
from backup.

CAUSE
=====

JET_errPageNotInitialized means that a page within the database is blank. If the
store will not start because of this error, it is likely that a page crucial to
the database is corrupt.

WORKAROUND
==========

It is not recommended that the database be repaired under this condition,
because there may be more than one uninitialized page.

You should restore the database from backup and investigate the cause of the
error, following this procedure:

1. Make an offline backup of the entire Exchange subdirectory structure on all
   drives (transaction logs and database files).

2. Locate the file EDB.CHK and include it in your backup set.

3. Disable any low-level access applications, including open file backup agents
   and virus checkers. Investigate these applications' compatibility with
   Exchange before you re-enable them.

4. Examine the System log for hardware-related errors.

5. Save your System and Application event logs and include them in your backup
   set.

6. Run diagnostics on the server hardware.

7. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for additional help.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Unlike a page that does not checksum (-1018), an uninitialized page (-1019) will
be backed up successfully. If a page is uninitialized, it may not always be
found on Startup, but it may be encountered during runtime. ESEUTIL /G finds
these errors (you can test the database after restoring).
