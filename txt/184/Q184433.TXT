OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Escape sequences for date, time, and datetime columns used for parameters to
stored procedures are incorrectly parsed by the ODBC SQL Server Driver version
number 3.50.0305 (Sqlsrv32.dll). The client receives the following error
messages:

   [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver]Fractional truncation [Microsoft][ODBC SQL
   Server Driver][SQL Server]Procedure <procname> expects parameter
   <paramname> which was not supplied.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem, use an earlier version of the driver (for example,
version 2.6x).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SQL Server Driver version
3.50.0305. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
