TITLE   :XADM: System Instabilities After Restoring Information Store
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you restore an information store from a backup, the Microsoft Exchange
Server computer may assign non-unique object identifiers to an offline storage
file (OST). If the same identifier is assigned to multiple objects, you may be
unable to create new messages in the information store or synchronize folders,
or you may experience other system instabilities.

CAUSE
=====

When you perform the restore, the globally unique identifier (GUID) and counter
associated with offline folder synchronization are not reset. Therefore, when
the server assigns an identifier range to an OST file, it may assign an
identifier range that has already been assigned to a different OST file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information about obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
