TITLE   :PRB: Compile Error: User-Defined Type Not Defined
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::2.0,2.1 SP2,2.5,2.6,5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp500 kbVBp600 kbGrpDSVBDB kbGrpDSMDAC kbDSupport kbADO210sp2 kbMDAC210SP2 kbATM kbm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), versions 2.0, 2.1 SP2, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you compile your ADO project, you receive the following error:

   Compile error: User-defined type not defined

This can occur on either a Connection or Command object.

CAUSE
=====

You may have referenced one of the following libraries instead of the Microsoft
ActiveX Data Objects (ADODB) type library:

 - Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects Recordset (ADOR) type library.

   -or-

 - Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects (Multi-dimensional) (ADOMD) type library.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the incorrect type library reference from your project, and add a
reference to the correct type library.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new project and add a command button (Command1) to a form.

2. Add a reference to the Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects Recordset Library.

3. Add the following code to the form:

      Private Sub Command1_Click()
      Dim cn As ADODB.Connection
      End Sub

4. Run the project and click the command button. The error appears.

5. Remove the reference, and add a reference to the Microsoft ActiveX Data
   Objects Library.

6. Click the command button. The error does not appear.

NOTE:

 - Microsoft Access users will have to use ADODB.Connection to avoid confusion
   with the DAO Connection object.

 - If the Intellitype feature is turned on, you should notice that it does not
   show Connection as a valid object with the ADOR type library, but does with
   the ADODB type library. This is a good indication that you do not have the
   correct type library referenced.

 - This error can also occur when referencing objects in other type libraries
   that aren't referenced.
