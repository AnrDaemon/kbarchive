TITLE   :PRB: SET COMPATIBLE ON Causes Problems with Arrays
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro

KEYWORDS:kbHWMAC kbvfp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSPRESS Hardcore Visual Basic, Second Edition ISBN 1-57231-422-2, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, Professional Edition, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If SET COMPATIBLE is ON and an array is redimensioned, the array loses it
previously saved values and sets the current value to logical false (.F.).

CAUSE
=====

When SET COMPATIBLE is set to ON or DB4, Visual FoxPro overwrites any existing
array with a variable of the same name when a STORE command or assignment is
made.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the array needs to retain its contents, try one of the following:

 - Issue SET COMPATIBLE OFF in the program or form.

 - Add COMPATIBLE=OFF to the Config.fpw file.

 - From the Tools menu, select Options. In the Options dialog box, click the
   General tab and clear the dBase compatibility check box.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

This can be demonstrated when an array is redimensioned within a loop. To
reproduce the problem, create a new program and enter the following code:

      CLEAR
      SET COMPATIBLE ON         && Or SET COMPATIBLE DB4
      DIMENSION atest(5)     && Dimension to some value.
      FOR i = 1 to 10
         DIMENSION atest(i)
         Atest(i)="Test "+ALLTRIM(STR(i))
      ENDFOR

      DISPLAY MEMORY LIKE atest

When the code is executed, the array has 10 elements, but only the last element
contains a value. The other elements contain a logical false (.F.).
