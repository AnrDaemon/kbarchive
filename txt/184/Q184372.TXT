SYMPTOMS

When you upgrade the Internet Authentication Services (IAS) via the Windows NT
4.0 Option Pack on a computer running a beta version of IAS on Windows NT Server
4.0, an error message may appear indicating that Setup was unable to install
IAS.

To work around this problem, uninstall IAS, and then re-install it from the
Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack.

   Before you install this release of IAS on a computer running the Beta 3
   version, you must stop IAS and then uninstall it.
