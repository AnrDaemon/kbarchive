TITLE   :XADM: Message Class Changed during Forward from Public Folder
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A public folder is set up with a Folder Assistant rule that specifies that mail
be forwarded (with the "Leave message intact" method) to another mailbox or
folder. A post with a message class of IPM.Post or IPM.Post.<Custom Name>
(where <Custom Name> is a user-defined form name), is changed to IPM.Note
when received. This causes the standard message form to be displayed for the
message, instead of the Post form (or custom Post form).

CAUSE
=====

A logic error changes the message class for messages that are forwarded with the
"Leave message intact" method.
