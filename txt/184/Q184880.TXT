TITLE   :XADM: Setup Does Not Detect Cluster Resources Properly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 into a cluster environment, you
may receive the following error message:

   This cluster group does not contain the appropriate system resources. Select
   a group that contains an IP address, a network name, and a shared hard disk.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Setup routine is hard-coded to look for
cluster resources of the following types: "IP Address," "Network Name," and
"Physical Disk."

Setup.exe does not recognize new storage types that are not of type "Physical
Disk." The dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are included with most third-party
clustering products do not identify the storage device as having a resource type
of "physical disk."


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Apply it only to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

   http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Setup Program

+---------------------------+
| File name   | Version     | 
+---------------------------+
| Srvrmax.exe | 5.5.1960.10 | 
+---------------------------+



After you obtain the fix, follow these steps to apply it:

1. Create a new folder on your hard disk, and then copy the contents of the
   Server\Setup\I386 folder from the Exchange Server 5.5 CD-ROM to this new
   folder.

2. Rename the Setup.exe file in the folder on the hard disk to Setup.old, and
   then rename the Srvrmax.exe file to Setup.exe.

3. Run Setup.exe from the folder on the hard disk.

4. When the installation process is finished, apply the latest service pack for
   Exchange Server 5.5, even if it was already applied previously. For
   additional information about how to obtain the latest service pack for
   Exchange Server 5.5, click the article number below to view the article in

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a resource type is not of type "Physical Disk," the fix will get the resource
class information to find out whether it is a shared storage type.

Microsoft Cluster Server resource information can be found in the following
location:

1. Start the Cluster Administrator (Cluadmin.exe).

2. Select the Groups object from the hierarchy.

3. Select the appropriate cluster group created for Exchange Server.

4. View the list of resources.

In addition, cluster resource information can be found at the following registry
keys:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Cluster\Resources\<relevant key for resource>

-AND-

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Cluster\Resource Types

For more information about configuring the cluster server for Setup with Exchange
Server, read the document "Clustering with Microsoft Exchange Server," which is
located on the Exchange Server 5.5 CD.
