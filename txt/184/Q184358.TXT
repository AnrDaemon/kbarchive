TITLE   :WD97: Text Becomes Wider Using Generic/Text Only Printer
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Typed characters become very wide if you select the Roman 10 cpi font when the
Generic/Text Only printer driver is selected as the default printer.

CAUSE
=====

Unlike earlier versions of Microsoft Word, Word 97 does not rely on printer
information (metrics) to lay out the document. Word 97 uses a new
printer-independent layout scheme controlled by the "Use printer metrics to lay
out document" compatibility option. In Word 97, this option is turned off by
default.

The Roman 10 cpi font is the only font available when the Generic/Text Only
printer driver is selected as the default printer. This font is not displayed
properly by the printer-independent layout scheme.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, select the "Use printer metrics to layout
document" option. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. Click the Compatibility tab.

3. In the Recommended Options For list, click Microsoft Word 97.

4. Click to select the "Use printer metrics to layout document" check box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This problem has been corrected in Word 2000.
