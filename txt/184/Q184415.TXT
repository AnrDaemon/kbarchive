The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Word, the HTML converter can only save using the US/Western
European code page.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Microsoft Excel, you can save an HTML file any of the following code pages;
however, this capability does not currently exist in Microsoft Word:

 - US/Western European
 - MS-DOS United States
 - MS-DOS Multilingual (Latin I)
 - Japanese (EUC)
 - Japanese (JIS)
 - Multilingual (UTF-8)/KSC 5700

Further, the Word HTML converter does not currently support the character sets
ISO 8895-2 (Polish) or KOI8-R (Russian).

KOI8-r is widely used on Russian Internet sites. Though the proposed character
set KOI8-R is not currently an international standard, there is a very large
user community supporting it for UNIX and global network programs in the former
Soviet Union.
