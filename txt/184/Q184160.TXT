TITLE   :XADM: Messages Left After Deleting Mailbox w/ Directory Import
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you delete a mailbox by performing a directory import with an import file,
one or more messages addressed to that recipient may remain in the information
store on the Microsoft Exchange Server computer. If you create the mailbox
again, and then the recipient logs on to an e-mail client, the messages appear
in the e-mail client.

This behavior does not occur if you delete the mailbox from the Exchange
Administrator program. If you delete the mailbox from the Administrator program,
all messages addressed to recipient are removed from the information store.

CAUSE
=====

When you modify or delete an object by performing a directory import, the object
attributes required to perform the operation are the only attributes that are
obtained from the directory. The attributes that are obtained when you delete an
object do not include the Home-MDB attribute, which is required to remove
messages addressed to that recipient from the information store.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information about obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
