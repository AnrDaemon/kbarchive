TITLE   :PRB: Windows 95 OSR 2.5 Starts IE 4.x During Installation
PRODUCT :Miscellaneous Software Development Kits
PROD/VER::4.0a,4.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOPK kbSBK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Windows 95 OEM Preinstall Kit (OPK), versions 4.0a, 4.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Delivery Service Partner (DSP) versions of Windows 95 OSR 2.5 starts the
Internet Explorer 4.01 setup at the end of the end-user setup. When the computer
starts for the first time in end-user mode, the Windows 95 Setup screen appears
with the following message:

   Windows 95 setup needs more information to finish customizing your computer.
   To continue click next.

The Cancel button is unavailable. When you click Next, the Internet Explorer 4.0
Active Setup screen appears and then the Internet Explorer 4.x Setup Wizard
starts.

RESOLUTION
==========

This workaround prevents Internet Explorer 4.x from installing during the
end-user mode from Windows 95 OSR 2.5. This works only during non- restorative
audit mode of the pre-installation process.

1. Start Notepad, and type the following:

         REM renaming file welcome.exe************************
         ren c:\windows\welcome.exe welcome.old
         ren c:\windows\options\cabs\welcome.exe welcome.old
         REM extract a new copy of welcome.exe****************
         extract /y c:\windows\options\cabs\Win95_03.Cab /a welcome.exe
         REM delete OLD files*********************************
         del c:\windows\welcome.old
         del c:\windows\options\cabs\welcome.old

2. Save this as "C:\Windows\Remove.bat".

3. Execute Remove.bat during non-restorative audit mode.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This process does not require the OSR 2.5 CD to work. You re-extract the
Welcome.exe file from the Windows 95 files on the Hard Drive. This does not
remove Internet Explorer 3.x. Instead, it prevents Internet Explorer 4.x from
installing at the End-User site. To remove Internet Explorer 3.x, you must
delete the Internet Explorer 3.x icon from the Desktop during non- restorative
audit mode. You can find more information on removing Internet Explorer 3.x from
Windows 95 OSR 2.x on the Microsoft OEM System Builder Web site at:
