TITLE   :XADM: Msg: The Description for Event ID Could Not Be Found
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view the application event log on the computer running Microsoft
Exchange Server from a remote computer, all the data in the event log is not
available.

The event viewer displays the following entry:

   The description for Event ID (<Event ID>) in Source (<Component name>)
   could not be found. It contains the following insertion string(s):
   <Component Specific Data>.

For example, the following entry will be displayed:

   The description for Event ID (8) in Source (EDB) could not be found. It
   contains the following insertion string(s): MSExchangeIS, (186), 04,
   993, 0000.

Instead of displaying:

   MSExchangeIS ((186)) The database engine 04.993.0000 started

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT provides the means of reading remote event logs, however, each
application that writes entries to the event log updates the registry with
information that helps the event viewer application interpret the information in
the event log. These registry keys are found under the following subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services
   \EventLog\Application

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

For example, when the Exchange Server components are installed on a computer
running Windows NT Server, they write keys to the registry in Windows NT Server
under the following subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services
   \EventLog\Application

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

When you view the event log on a computer running Exchange Server from a remote
computer, if the required registry keys (and referenced files) are not present
on the remote computer, the event viewer is unable to format the data; hence it
displays the data in a generic format.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, the required registry entries and DLL files must be
copied to the remote computer on which the event viewer application is being
run.

The Initlog.exe utility, in the "BackOffice Resource Kit, Second Edition," can be
used to copy the required registry entries from the Exchange Server computer to
the remote computer. This utility can also copy the required DLL files if you
are logged on to Windows NT with an account that has Administrator privilege on
the Exchange Server computer.

WARNING: Because the Initlog.exe program modifies the registry on the remote
computer, please back up the registry before running this program.

NOTE: The DLLs used are service-pack specific, so you may need to run the program
again on the remote computer after installing a service pack on the Exchange
Server computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Event Log Initialization Program, Initlog.exe, is a program to
help Administrators remotely view the Windows NT Event Log for their computers
running Windows NT Server.

Initlog.exe prompts the Administrator for the name of a server on which the
required registry keys are present. The utility then prompts the user to select
the registry keys to be copied from the server specified to the local computer.
The program then automatically copies the specified registry keys from the
remote server to the registry on the local computer.

Associated with the registry keys copied to the local computer are files that
also need to be copied. If a currently logged-on Windows NT user account has
Administrative rights on the remote server, the program can be asked to
automatically copy the required files to the local computer. If the current
Windows NT account does not have Administrative rights on the remote server, a
list of files to be copied is written out to a file,
EventLogFilesToBeCopied.Txt, that can then be used to manually copy the required
files to the local computer. This file is saved in a directory that the user
selects.

To run this program, double-click on the InitLog.exe program from the Windows NT
File Manager, or Windows Explorer.
