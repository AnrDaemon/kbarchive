PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a Visual Basic application to post a form to a public folder,
Microsoft Outlook leaks memory. The memory leak can exhaust all resources on the
computer on which Outlook is running. Outlook.exe also remains in memory after
the application is finished. The only way to free the memory is to end the
OUTLOOK task from the task manager.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Microsoft Outlook 98.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Outlook clients
listed above.
