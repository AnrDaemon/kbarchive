TITLE   :Available Bytes Counter Definition is Incorrect in Perfmon
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The counter definition in Performance Monitor for the object Memory and counter
Available Bytes incorrectly states that:

   Available Bytes displays the size of the virtual memory currently on the
   Zeroed, Free, and Standby lists. Zeroed and Free memory is ready for
   use, with Zeroed memory cleared to zeros. Standby memory is memory
   removed from a process's Working Set but still available. Notice that
   this is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval.

The counter definition should read as follows:

   Available Bytes is the amount of physical memory available to processes
   running on the computer, in bytes. It is calculated by summing space on
   the Zeroed, Free, and Standby memory lists. Free memory is ready for
   use; Zeroed memory is pages of memory filled with zeros to prevent later
   processes from seeing data used by a previous process. Standby memory is
   memory removed from a process's working set (its physical memory) on
   route to disk, but is still available to be recalled.

This information can be found in the Counters.hlp file, part of the Windows NT
Workstation 4.0 Resource Kit.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Available Bytes is correctly defined as Physical Memory in the following
documents:

Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Resource Kit: Part III, Chapter 12, Page 400

   Available Bytes:
   Description: How much memory is left for processes to allocate? This is
   an instantaneous count, not an average.

The Optimization and Tuning of Windows NT white paper by Scott B. Suhy:

   The counter "Memory Available Bytes" displays the amount of free
   physical memory. If this counter stays consistently below 4 MB, paging
   is occurring and performance is less than optimal.
