SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Ping utility to ping another computer by its NetBIOS name, the
Ping utility may take a long time to return results.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when no Domain Name System (DNS) server is available on
the network. The Ping utility first queries DNS for a host name. If no DNS
server is available, the TCP/IP protocol will try the DNS query again. Only
after the DNS queries do not succeed will the Ping utility attempt to resolve
the name by using the NetBIOS name resolution sequence.

MORE INFORMATION
================
