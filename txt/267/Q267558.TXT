TITLE   :SMS: CAPs & DPs Generate Critical Errors on Novell Servers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbCAP kbNDS kbOSNovell

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In a mixed Microsoft Windows NT and Netware environment, it is possible for
Client Access Points (CAPs) and Distribution Points (DPs) running on Netware
servers to generate critical error messages while the NT CAPs and DPs continue
to function properly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a Systems Management Server site server runs in such a mixed environment
two different security systems come into effect - Windows NT and Netware.

In order for site systems (CAPs and DPs) to function properly on Netware servers
and for the site server to be able to contact them, an account with proper
Netware permissions must be created and added to Netware.

If you notice Netware site systems generating critical errors, verify whether it
is a security problem by looking in the Inbox Manager log (Inboxmgr.log) if
enabled on the site server.

The following log example contains the errors that may be recorded:

Note: In order to view the NAL errors, you will first need to enable NAL logging
on the site server as documented in the following article:

Inboxmgr.log:

To recover from this state you need to create an administrator's account on the
Novell server, and grant it proper rights to the CAP and Distribution Point
folders.

For the proper permissions required on these folder, refer to the white paper at
this location:

   Integrating Microsoft Systems Management Server 2.0 With Novell NetWare

Once that account is created you need to configure the Systems Management Server
(SMS) Site Server:

1. Within the SMS Administrator Console, navigate to:

   Site Settings\Connection accounts\Site system

2. Right-click Site System, and then choose New - Netware account. Add the tree
   and user name that were previously created.

Once this is done you can monitor the Inbox Manager log again. You should see the
following log entries:

  	
   NAL[4] - GetPath returns path: \\MYNDSTREE\.MYVOLS_VOL1.QUALITY.CHARLOTTE\ 
   SMS_INBOX_MANAGER
   NAL[4] - Try() is attempting to access \\MYNDSTREE\.MYVOLS_VOL1.QUALITY.CHARLOTTE\CAP_GS1\ 
   SMS_INBOX_MANAGER
   NAL[4] - Try() succeeded. 
   SMS_INBOX_MANAGER
   NAL[4] - _TryUser() succeeded. 
   SMS_INBOX_MANAGER 
   NAL[4] - TryEachInList() succeeded. 
   SMS_INBOX_MANAGER

   Established connection to ["Display=\\MYNDSTREE\.MYVOLS_VOL1.QUALITY.CHARLOTTE"]NWNDS:["SMS_SITE=GS1"]\\MYNDSTREE\.MYVOLS_VOL1.QUALITY.CHARLOTTE\CAP_GS1\
