SYMPTOMS
========

The Systems Management Server (SMS) Client Configuration Manager (CCM) component
does not start the Client Bootstrap service if you use the Disk Administrator
tool (Windisk.exe) to change the operating system partition hard disk letter
designation.

CAUSE
=====

Disk Administrator does not update the following registry key value when you
change the hard disk letter:

   HKEY_Local_Machine\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion <path
   name>

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Modify the following registry key with the correct hard disk letter:

   HKEY_Local_Machine\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion <path
   name>
