TITLE   :Cannot Set NTFS Permissions on Clustered File Share Resource
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to modify the NTFS permissions on a file that you have copied
to a network share that is located on a cluster server as a File Share resource,
the following error messages may be displayed:

   Object Picker cannot open because it cannot determine whether
   <Network Name Resource> is joined to a domain.

   Unable to display the user selection dialog.
   Access is denied.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if all of the following conditions exist:

 - SQL 7.0 is installed on the cluster server and was configured as a Cluster
   resource in an active/passive configuration by using the SQL Failover Wizard.

 - The file share you are connecting to is hosted by a cluster server as a File
   Share resource.

 - The file share source is located on the same hard disk as SQL 7.0 on the
   cluster server, and is located in the same resource group as SQL 7.0.

 - You are attempting to modify NTFS permissions on a file that is located on
   the cluster server by using a user account that does not have administrator
   privileges on the cluster server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this behavior from occurring, create the File Share resource in a
different cluster resource group, and on a different hard disk than the hard
disk on which SQL 7.0 is installed.
