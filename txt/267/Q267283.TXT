KEYWORDS:kbWin2000PreSP2Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 to connect to a virtual
directory that is located on a Novell Netware server, you may receive a red
error icon in the IIS Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in stating that
the connection is inaccessible.

CAUSE
=====

IIS does not support the UNC connection to a computer in a domain that does not
have a trust relationship with the domain where IIS server resides.

WORKAROUND
==========


To work around this behavior, do the following:

1. On the computer running IIS, create a user with the same user name and
   password as the connect as user and give this user the logon locally right.
   (Log on to the IIS server with this user account to verify that the user has
   the logon locally right.)

2. On the remote (UNC share) computer, give the above user access permissions on
   both the share and on the physical directory that the share hands out.

3. The physical directory must have the everyone permission if there are ASP
   pages in the directory.

4. The share must have the everyone permission for the MMC to display the files.


STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
