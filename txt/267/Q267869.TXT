TITLE   :Windows NT 4.0 SP 6 May Make Empty Folder Structure C:\Inetpub
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6 or Service Pack 6a, an empty
folder structure may be created in the C:\Inetpub folder. Note that this only
occurs if you install the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack (including the
"ExAir" sample), and your Inetpub folder is different from C:\Inetpub.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, note that you can safely delete the empty folders
in the C:\Inetpub folder because the files in your actual Inetpub folder have
been updated correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6.
