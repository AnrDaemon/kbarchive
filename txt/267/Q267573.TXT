CAUSE
=====

The HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Rpc\ClientProtocols registry key is
absent. It is likely that the removal of a previous software application removed
this key by mistake.

RESOLUTION
==========

Replace the key in the registry and it enables the system attendant to start.

NOTE: Import this registry key from a Microsoft Windows 2000-based server that
has the same protocols installed on it. You can manually rebuild the
ClientProtocols folder and add all the protocol values, but it is recommended
that you import this key from a Windows 2000-based server running with the same
protocols.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

You can manually add the needed registry key and values. To do this, perform the
following steps:

1. Open regedit.

2. Browse to the HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Rpc key.

3. Under RPC, If there is not a subkey named ClientProtocols, add one. Under the
   subkey named ClientProtocols, if any of the following values and data strings
   are missing, add them.

Value 0
  Name:            ncacn_http
  Type:            REG_SZ
  Data:            rpcrt4.dll
 
Value 1
  Name:            ncacn_ip_tcp
  Type:            REG_SZ
  Data:            rpcrt4.dll
 
Value 2
  Name:            ncacn_nb_tcp
  Type:            REG_SZ
  Data:            rpcrt4.dll
 
Value 3
  Name:            ncacn_np
  Type:            REG_SZ
  Data:            rpcrt4.dll
 
Value 4
  Name:            ncadg_ip_udp
  Type:            REG_SZ
  Data:            rpcrt4.dll

4. Close regedit.

Now you can start Exchange 2000 successfully.
