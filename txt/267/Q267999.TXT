TITLE   :FIX: FrontPage 98 and VisID Cannot Open Web Through SSL
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOSWin2000 kbiis500prod2web kbProd2Web

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows 
 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Visual InterDev, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 or Internet Information
Server (IIS) 4.0 with the FrontPage Server Extensions and with a Verisign or
Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) certificate, attempting to open Web sites in the
FrontPage 98 client or Visual InterDev through HTTPS may fail. The root
certificate authority is not recognized as a trusted authority, and therefore,
the connection is not allowed. However, if the Web site is viewed in a browser,
such as Internet Explorer 4.01 SP1 or later, you can view the Web site without
problems.

CAUSE
=====

The FrontPage 98 client and Visual InterDev only support a few select
Certificate Authorities. The FrontPage 98 client and Visual InterDev only
support 40-bit encryption. Verisign has changed their original 40-bit
certificate, which causes FrontPage 98 and Visual InterDev to not recognize the
Root CA as a trusted authority.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For another way to resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Create a new certificate request on the IIS 4.0 or 5.0 server.

2. Submit the request to Verisign, and make sure that "IBM" is selected as the
   server type, as opposed to "Microsoft" (contact Verisign for help obtaining
   this certificate).

3. Make sure that the previous certificate has been removed from the Key
   Manager, and make sure to "Commit All Changes" afterwards.

4. When the new certificate has been received from Verisign, install the
   certificate to the appropriate Web site.

5. In a browser, test HTTPS access. In FrontPage 98 or Visual InterDev, test
   HTTPS access again.

This resolution should provide access to the Web site from FrontPage 98 and
Visual InterDev through HTTPS.
