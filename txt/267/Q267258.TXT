SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install a Systems Management Server (SMS) hotfix on a
secondary site, the hotfix may seem to be installed correctly, or may not be
installed. If the hotfix is not installed, you may see the following text in the
Q<nnnnnn>.log file that is generated when you install a hotfix:

   Installation aborted. This system is not running SMS version number
   2.00.1239.1000. Instead, the version reported is 000.

   -or-

   Installation aborted. This system is not running SMS version number
   2.00.1380.1000. Instead, the version reported is 000.

However, the server is in fact running SMS 2.0 or SMS 2.0 SP1.

The Q<nnnnnn>.log file is located in the SMS\Logs folder on the site server
on which you installed the hotfix. The <nnnnnn> portion of the file name
represents the number of the hotfix you installed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you either installed or upgraded an SMS 2.0 secondary
site directly from the SMS Administrator console at the primary site. This issue
does not occur on sites that you installed or upgraded by using the CD-ROM.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this issue, manually create or update the required registry value. To
create or update this value on secondary sites:

1. Start Registry Editor.

2. Locate and click the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Setup

3. If the Full Version value exists, manually update it with the correct data
   value:

    - SMS 2.0 release version (build 1239): 2.00.1239.0000
    - SMS 2.0 SP1 release version (build 1380): 2.000.1380.1000

4. If the Full Version value does not exist, create it and add the appropriate
   data value:

   Value Name: Full Version
   Data Type: REG_SZ
   Value: 2.00.1239.0000 -or- 2.00.1380.0000

5. Quit Registry Editor.

After you follow these steps, you can continue installing the hotfix.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
