SYMPTOMS
========

If you create an AppWizard project in a folder that contains the name "template"
as a subfolder, all files in the project folder are excluded from the build.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do one of the following:

 - Do not use "template" as a folder name.

 - Manually include all files back into the project.

You can also include the excluded files in the build by clicking Settings on the
Project menu. In the Project Settings dialog box, select all .cpp/.c/.odl/.idl
files in the tree view on the left, and then clear the Exclude file from build
check box in the General tab.


STATUS

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In the Visual C++ environment, click New on the File menu, and then click the
   Projects tab.

2. Select a project type; for example, MFC AppWizard (EXE).

3. Type a project name. Make sure that location points to a folder that contains
   "template" as a subfolder.

4. Accept the defaults for the project.

You can verify this by clicking Settings on the Project menu. In the Project
Settings dialog box, select the .cpp, .c, .idl, or .odl file, and then view the
