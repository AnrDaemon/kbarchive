CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Fnumber.dat file contains a value that is less
than the highest management agent working folder number.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, manually edit the Fnumber.dat file:

1. Open the Zoomserv\Data\Ds folder and look for the largest folder number in
   the folder (for example, 00000032).

2. In the same folder, look for a file named Fnumber.dat.

3. Open the Fnumber.dat file with any text editor.

4. Change the number to equal the number you found in step 1.

5. Save and close the file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Fnumber.dat file is a text file that contains a numeric value that should
reflect the number of management agents that have previously been created. The
contents of the file are incremented each time a management agent is created. If
the file is restored from a backup or changed improperly to a value that is less
than the number of the highest management agent working folder, the error
message is displayed.
