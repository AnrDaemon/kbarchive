TITLE   :Incorrect Last Modified Time for File Is Returned
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you query the last modified date of a file stored on a Windows NT-based
server, an incorrect date may be returned. If you then use this value to
manually update the last modified date of the file on the server, the incorrect
date can end up being permanently applied to the file.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Query File Information Server Message Block
(SMB) only returns a 32-bit value for the last modified time. However, the NTFS
file system stores the last modified time internally as a 64-bit value. When the
SMB request is processed on the server, it returns the low 32 bits of this
64-bit time instead of converting it to a valid 32-bit value.

==========
