PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2 SP4,2.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbClient kbsms120 kbsms120bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2 SP4, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you change a Microsoft Windows 2000-based System Management Server (SMS) 1.2
client Internet Protocol (IP) address without restarting the computer, an
administrator cannot remotely control the client computer.

CAUSE
=====

In previous versions of the Windows operating systems, you had to restart the
computer to change the client IP address. In Windows 2000, the change is
immediate and you do not need to restart the computer. However, the SMS Remote
Control agent continues to use the previous IP address for Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Listen until you restart the client computer
or stop and then start the SMS Remote Control agent.

WORKAROUND
==========

After the user changes the IP address on a Windows 2000-based client, you must
either restart the client computer or stop and then restart the SMS Remote
Control agent to re-enable remote control.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
