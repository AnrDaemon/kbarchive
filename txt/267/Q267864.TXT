SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft has released a tool that corrects the permissions on several registry
values in Microsoft Windows NT 4.0. The default permissions could allow a
malicious user to gain additional privileges on an affected machine.

The "MTS Package Administration" key,
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Transaction Server\Packages, includes
information about which users are allowed to install and change Microsoft
Transaction Server (MTS) packages. By adding herself as an MTS manager, a
malicious user could gain the ability to add, delete, or change MTS packages.
Although it might be possible in some cases to make the needed registry changes
remotely, the malicious user would still need the ability to log onto the
affected comptuer interactively in order to exercise her new privileges. MTS is
not installed on Windows NT 4.0 machines by default.
