TITLE   :XADM: Directory Service Does Not Start After Restore Operation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you restore the information store or the directory database, the services
for these items do not start, and the following message is logged in the
Application event log:

   The errors JET_errDatabaseCorrupted (-1206 = 0xfffffb4a = 4294966090) and
   JET_errDatabaseInconsistent (-550 = 0xFFFFFDDA = 4294966746)

In addition, if you use the Eseutil tool with the /r option, the tools fails.

CAUSE
=====

This error message described in the "Symptoms" section is a generic message; it
can occur if you restore a database to a recovery server and databases already
exist in the database folders. In this case, the database on the tape is not
actually corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, restore the database in an empty corresponding database
folder. For example, if the directory service does not start, stop the directory
service, rename the existing Dsadata folder on all drives, create new Dsadata
folders on the drives, and then perform another restore operation.
