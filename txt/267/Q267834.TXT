KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to log on to a Terminal Server client session, you may receive the
following error message:

   Terminal Service Client Disconnected
   The connection to the server has timed out. Try connecting to the terminal
   server again.

When this issue occurs, you see a computer with a state of "Down" on the Sessions
tab in the Terminal Server Administration tool on the server.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if there is a mapped network drive letter as the first
entry in the PATH environment variable. For example, this behavior can occur if
a network drive is mapped as drive X, and the PATH statement is:

   PATH=x:\<sharename>;c:\winnt;...

WORKAROUND
==========

Change the PATH variable so that the mapped network drive letter is not the
first entry.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.
