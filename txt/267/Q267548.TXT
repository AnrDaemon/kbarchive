SYMPTOMS

When you attempt to start Cluster Administrator, you may receive the following
error message:

   An error occurred trying to open the cluster at <Clustername>.

   The RPC Server is unavailable

   Error ID: 1722 (000006ba)

Also, the following errors may appear in the cluster node System Event Log:

   Event ID: 1069
   Source: ClusSvc
   Description: Cluster resource 'Cluster IP Address' failed.

   Event ID: 1048
   Source: ClusSvc
   Description: Cluster IP Address resource <resource name> cannot be
   brought online because the adapter name parameter is invalid. Please check
   your network configuration.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you have replaced your network adapter, or have changed
the IP address of your public network adapter.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

NOTE: The following steps must be performed from one of the cluster nodes. These
steps will not work from a computer that is not a member of the cluster.

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "cluadmin /noreconnect" (without the quotation marks),
   and then press ENTER.

3. When you receive the prompt for the cluster name, enter a period "." (without
   the quotes), and then click Open.

4. Under the Groups item, click Cluster Group.

5. In the right-side pane, double-click Cluster IP Address.

6. Click the Parameters tab.

7. In the Network box, choose the name of your Public network adapter, for
   example, "Public(1)", and then click OK.

8. Repeat steps 5-7 for any other virtual IP Address resources that are not
   working in all of the groups on your cluster.

9. Right-click the Cluster Group, and then click Bring Online. Repeat this step
   for all groups.

Another solution to this issue is:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "cluadmin" (without the quotation marks), and then
   press ENTER.

3. When you are prompted to start the Cluster Service, click No.

4. Click File|Open.

5. Enter a period "." (without the quotation marks) in the Network textbox.

6. Under the Groups item, click Cluster Group.

7. In the right-side pane, double-click Cluster IP Address.

8. Click the Parameters tab.

9. In the Network box, choose the name of your Public network adapter, for
   example, "Public(1)", and then click OK.

10. Repeat steps 7-9 for any other virtual IP Address resources that are not
   working, and then continue to the next step.

11. Right-click the Cluster Group, and then click Bring Online. Repeat this step
   for all groups.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the IP address for the public network adapter is changed, or the network
card is replaced, the network adapter is detected as a new network. When this
change occurs, IP Address resources in Cluster Administrator are not
automatically associated with the new network adapter.
