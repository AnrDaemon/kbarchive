SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 Service Pack 2
(SP2), periodically in the Windows NT event log on Systems Management Server
site systems, you may receive the following error messages (Event 1011):

At the Site server:

   The library file "<Drive>:\SMS\bin\i386\SMSPERF.dll" specified for the
   "SMSPerfCountersFor<Drive>:_SMS_BIN_I386_SMSPERF.DLL" service could not
   be opened. Performance data for this service will not be available. Status
   code is data DWORD 0.

At the Logon Point:

   The library file "<Drive>:\SMSLOGON\I386\SMSPERF.dll" specified for the
   "SMSPerfCountersFor<Drive>:_SMSLOGON_I386_SMSPERF.DLL" service could
   not be opened. Performance data for this service will not be available.Status
   code is data DWORD 0.

CAUSE
=====

A performance-monitoring program is attempting to load Systems Management
Server-related performance counter data by using invalid registry information.
When you install SP2, existing SMSPerf registry keys are not removed from the
registry, although they are no longer used.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Use Registry Editor on the server that is generating the error message to delete
the subkeys that start with "SMSPerfCountersfor" from the following key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.
