======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Streets and Trips 2001 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Microsoft Streets & Trips 2001, you may receive the
following error message when you restart the computer if the Streets & Trips
Run CD is in the CD-ROM drive:

   Unable to load vital strings. This application will now close.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the QBCD Autorun memory-resident program is loaded
during the Microsoft Windows startup sequence.

This program is installed by QuickBooks and QuickBooks Pro.

If the Streets & Trips 2001 Run CD is inserted in the CD-ROM drive, QBCD
Autorun attempts to start Streets & Trips 2001 before the Windows startup
sequence is complete.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, remove the Streets & Trips 2001 Run CD from the
CD-ROM drive before you start the computer or contact Intuit to obtain
instructions about how to uninstall QBCD Autorun or how to prevent it from
loading automatically during the Windows startup sequence.
