The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Site Server version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Site Server version 3.0, Commerce Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Site Server Search does not provide hit-highlighting capabilities. If you desire
this functionality and you meet at least the following requirements, you can use
Index Server to implement this functionality:

    - You are performing a file crawl on local documents.

 - You have IIS installed and running on the document server.

 - You are already familiar with coding Search Server ASP and Index Server HTW
   pages.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To enable hit-highlighting, do the following:

1. Create a new Web site on the document server that points to the document
   data.

2. Create an HTW file as a template for your hit highlighting and place this
   file in a directory on your document server. Grant this file Script
   permissions.

3. Modify your search results page to reference the HTW file on the document
   server, passing in at least the following parameters: CiWebHitsFile,
   CiRestriction, CiHiliteType, CiBeginHilite, CiEndHilite.

At this point, clients can perform a search using the Search Server search and
results pages. When they click on a result, they can forward to the
hit-highlighted version of the document as constructed by the HTW page.

NOTES:

 - No catalogs need to be generated in Index Server. You are only using the
   hit-highlighting functionality.

 - No additional security problems should arise because the Web sites introduced
   do not have default pages or directory browsing. Additionally, they will be
   protected by using NTCR. No additional configuration is needed for this
   beyond the initial creation of the Web site.

 - The document server may reside on the Search server itself.
