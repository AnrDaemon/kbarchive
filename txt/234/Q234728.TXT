MORE INFORMATION
================

CD-ROM: Trial Software Overwrites Existing Versions
---------------------------------------------------

If your computer already has Microsoft FrontPage installed, it will be
overwritten when you install the trial version of FrontPage 2000 that is
included with this book. The previously installed version of FrontPage is
overwritten by the trial version even if you specify during the setup to keep
it.

If you install the trial version of FrontPage that accompanies this book, you
will need to re-install your full version after the trial period has ended.


Page 43: The Inserted File Is An .rtf File, Not A .doc File
-----------------------------------------------------------

Numerous text corrections on this page have been made by packager so that users
insert an rtf document, not a Word document, into a Web page. The
MSPRESS-supplied file that the users insert is Location.rtf, not Location .doc.


Page 55: Screen Shot Positioned Incorrectly Within Steps
--------------------------------------------------------

The screen shot should be placed after step 6, not after step 5.


Page 80: Missing Step In Procedure
----------------------------------

Need to add ", and then click Yes" to the first sentence of step 8 to reflect a
dialog box that now appears when applying themes to Web.


Page 83: Dialog Box Button Name Has Changed
-------------------------------------------

Since the first printing of this book, the Cancel button has changed to the No
button in a dialog box that appears when users modify a theme.

To fix:
In step 7, change "Cancel" to "No"


Page 86: Step 5 Is Incorrect
----------------------------

Step 5 on this page is now incorrect, due to a change in the software.

Please change:
In the Page Banner Text box, type Lakewood Mountains Resort, and then click OK.

To:
Click OK.


Page 87: Text In Image Is Incorrect
-----------------------------------

The image on page 87 shows the text:

"[Add this page to the Navigation view to display a page banner here]"

When you view this image in FrontPage 2000 this text does not exist.


Pages 172-173: Steps 1 And 2 Lacking Directions
-----------------------------------------------

Steps 1 and 2 in the Assign Web pages to frames procedure on these pages are
incorrect. Please change the first sentence of step 1 to say the following:
"Click Set Initial Page in the left frame."

Change the first sentence of step 2 to the following:
"Click Set Initial Page in the right frame."


Page 176: Filename Incorrect
----------------------------

The filename in step 4 is incorrect. Please change it from Menu01.htm to
Menu02.htm.

Page 184: Result of step 6 incorrect
------------------------------------

The second step in the result after step 6 is no longer correct. Please delete:
"A navigation bar with default hyperlinks appears at the top of the shared
border."

Last Page: Microsoft FrontPage 2000 not included with the book
--------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft FrontPage 2000 is not included with the title "Microsoft FrontPage 2000
Step by Step."

Please change the first paragraph on the last page to read:

"The enclosed CD-ROM contains ready-to-use practice files that complement the
lessons in this book. To use the CD, you'll need either the Windows 95, Windows
98, or the Windows NT version 4 operating system. You will also need to be
