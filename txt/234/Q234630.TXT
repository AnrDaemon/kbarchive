TITLE   :XADM: Event Scripts Fail after Installing Exchange 5.5 SP2
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2 (SP2), applications that
use Cdo.dll may start receiving an error of 0x800401F0 (CO_E_NOTINITIALIZED)
indicating that CoInitialize() has not been called. The most common environment
where this may be seen is with event scripts that run using the Microsoft Event
Service. This problem will typically be seen with event scripts that log on to a
new MAPI session from within the script.

The application event log may show events that look similar to the following:

   Event ID: 6
   Source: MSExchangeES
   Description: An unexpected MAPI error occurred while processing binding
   "Script Name". Error returned was [0x800401f0].

   Event ID: 16
   Source: MSExchangeES
   Description: Unexpected error 0x800401f0 occurred during processing of
   timer-based events.

CAUSE
=====

Changes were made in Exchange Server 5.5 SP2 to allow Cdo.dll to properly
support the Component Object Model (COM) Multi-Threaded Apartment (MTA) model.
The Microsoft Event Service exposed a problem with these changes.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

later:
