TITLE   :XCLN: Send To Mail Recipient Opens an Outlook Plain Text Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2000
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you right-click a file, click Send To, and then click Mail Recipient, an
Outlook plain text message opens.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because when you right-click a file, click Send To, and
then click Mail Recipient, you are using the simple Messaging Application
Programming Interface (MAPI) function MAPISendMail(), which does not use the
Outlook default message format.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, change the Sendto function to use the Outlook default
message format, for example, Rich Text Format (RTF) or Hypertext Markup Language
(HTML). (To set the Outlook default message format, click Options on the Tools
menu, click Mail Format, and in the Send in this message format list, click the
format that you want to use.)

To change the Sendto function to use the Outlook default message format, you need
to create a shortcut in the Send To folder that calls an Outlook formatted
message window:

1. In Microsoft Windows Explorer, double-click to open the Windows\SendTo
   folder.

2. Right-click the background of the Contents pane (the large pane on the
   right), point to New on the shortcut menu, and then click Shortcut.

3. Type the path to the Outlook.exe file, or click Browse and to browse to the
   Outlook.exe file.

4. Type a space followed by "/c ipm.note" (without the quotation marks)
   following the last character on the command line, for example:

   "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Outlook.exe" /c ipm.note

   Note that the "/c" switch is outside the command line quotation marks.

5. Click Next.

6. Type "Mail Recipient Using Outlook" (without the quotation marks) in the
   "Select a name for the shortcut" box, and then click Finish.

To test to see if the Sendto function uses the Outlook default message format,
right-click a file on the Windows desktop, point to Send To on the shortcut
menu, and then click Mail Recipient Using Outlook. An Outlook e-mail form should
open that contains only the file as an attachment.
