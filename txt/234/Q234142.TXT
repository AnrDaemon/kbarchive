======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you change the name of the computer that Internet Information Server (IIS)
is installed on, most IIS functionality continues to work properly without any
intervention; however, the following functions of IIS need to be updated:

 - The Internet Information Server snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console
   (MMC).
 - Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) packages that run in a separate memory
   space (isolated process).

This article explains how to make the MMC and isolated process MTS packages
perform properly after the computer has been renamed.

Note: This article does not cover the scenario of having Site Server 3.0
installed. Changing the name of a computer with Site Server installed creates a
non-supportable environment. If the computer is renamed, full functionality may
only be restored by restoring the OS to its previous configuration from backup.
Limited functionality is possible; however, this configuration is not supported.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This article assumes that when the Windows NT Option Pack was installed, a
Remote administrative account was NOT selected for MTS; instead, the default of
Local user was accepted. It also assumes that no custom MTS packages have been
installed (other than the packages that are automatically created for ASP
applications). If these assumptions are not true in your case, MTS may need more
modification than what is described in this article.

This article also assumes that the original IUSR and IWAM accounts
(IUSR_<Old_ComputerName> and IWAM_<Old_ComputerName> by default)
will continue to be used. Although they use the old computer name, these
accounts are still valid and usable.

This article does not apply to Windows 2000, because Microsoft has simplified the
process for renaming a computer that is running Internet Information Services
5.0. To change the NetBIOS name of a computer that is running IIS 5.0, simply
rename the server and restart it. After you restart the server, Windows 2000
Compensating Resource Managers (CRM) correct the inconsistency in the System
COM+ Application and allow IIS 5.0 to function normally with the new NetBIOS
name. Note that the IUSR and IWAM account names are not changed, but are still
valid.

Fixing the MMC:

If no computer name is displayed under "Internet Information Server" in the Scope
(left hand) pane of the MMC, you need to create a new console (.msc) for the MMC
that includes the Internet Information Server and Microsoft Transaction Server
snap-ins.

Note: The following error message may also occur:

   Error connecting to <Old_ComputerName>: The RPC server is unavailable.

To fix these problems, create a new console (.msc) for the MMC by performing the
following steps:

IMPORTANT: Any customization that you previously performed to the original IIS
console will be lost.

1. Start the Internet Service Manager (ISM), which loads the Internet
   Information Server and Microsoft Transaction Server snap-ins for the
   Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

2. From the Console menu, click New.

3. From the Console menu, click Add/Remove Snap-in.

4. On the Standalone tab, click the Add button. Select the Internet Information
   Server snap-in, and then click OK.

5. Click the Add button again, and then select the Microsoft Transaction Server
   snap-in.

6. Click OK twice to return to the main MMC window.

7. From the Console menu, click Save.

8. To replace the console that is run from the "Internet Service Manager" Start
   menu, save the console file to %WinDir%\System32\Inetsrv\Iis.msc.

Updating Isolated Process MTS Packages:

1. In the MMC, open the following in the Scope (left side) pane:

  Microsoft Transaction Server\ 
    Computers\ 
      My Computer\ 
        Packages Installed

2. For every ASP application that has been set to run in a separate memory space
   (isolated process), there is a corresponding isolated process MTS package
   (called a "server package" in MTS terminology). In the MMC, the names of
   these isolated process packages begin with the text "IIS-" followed by the
   Web site name and path enclosed by braces {}, for example: "IIS-{Default Web
   Site//Root/Iissamples/Issamples/Oop}".

   The user listed in the Identity property sheet of each isolated process
   package refers to the old computer name. These must be updated to the new
   computer name. To do this, perform the following steps for each isolated
   process package:

   a. Right-click the isolated process package, and then click Properties.

   b. Click the Identity tab.

   c. For the "This user" option, change the User from
      <Old_ComputerName>\<IWAM_UserName> to
      <New_ComputerName>\<IWAM_UserName>, provide the account
      password, and then click OK.

   d. Click OK if you receive the following warning:

   The packages were created by one or more external products. Are you certain
   the changes you are about to make are supported by these products?
