KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbHelpDesk kbsms200sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to remotely control a Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows
98 client, the Remote Control session may time out without prompting the user
for permission if there is a space in the administrator's user name and the
"Display a message to ask for permission" option is enabled.

In most cases, the "Asking for User's Permission" dialog box is displayed,
immediately followed by a "The user did not grant permission before the timeout
period elapsed" message. The user at the client computer typically is not
prompted to grant permission to the administrator.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

Remove the space from the user name for the administrator account in use. For
example, change "Help Desk" to "HelpDesk" or use any other name that does not
contain a space.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.
