TITLE   :INF: Determine Conversation State in CICS After SYNCPOINT
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0 SP2,4.0SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsna400sp2

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 4.0 SP2 
 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article deals with sample application code for a host Customer Information
Control System (CICS) TP monitor.

The sample program, SyncLev2.txt, is installed with the COM Transaction
Integrator for CICS and IMS feature of SNA Server. It is found in the following
directory:

   SNA\COMTI\SampleCode\SyncLev2

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code snippet from it is not correct.

********************************************************
      ** CHECK THE EIB FIELDS TO DETERMINE WHAT ACTION COMTI
      ** HAS REQUESTED, THEN ISSUE EITHER A SYNCPOINT OR     
      ** ROLLBACK.
      ********************************************************
       NORMAL-TX-SYNCPOINT.
           IF EIBSYNC = X'FF'
              EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT END-EXEC
              EXEC CICS RECEIV
                        RESP(CMD-RESP)
                        STATE(CONV-STATE)
                        END-EXEC

After the CICS syncpoint command is issued (EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT), the LU6.2
conversation may be in either a receive state (code: 88) or in a free state
(code: 85). If it is in a receive state, you need to issue an EXEC CICS RECEIVE
command in the program, as follows, otherwise, just quit the program.

*FIRST, DETERMINE THE CONVERSATION STATE.
 EXEC CICS EXTRACT ATTRIBUTES
   STATE (CONV-STATE)
   END-EXEC

*THEN, ACT ACCORDINGLY.
 IF CONV-STATE = 88
   EXEC CICS RECEIVE
     RESP(CMD-RESP)
     STATE(CONV-STATE)
     END-EXEC
   END-IF

Similar logic should also be executed if the EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK command
is issued.
