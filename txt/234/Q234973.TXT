The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When deploying to a Web server using the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW),
you see the following error:

   Unexpected error number 80042114 has occurred: The Web server you selected
   does not indicate support for the service provider you selected.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs for one or more of the following reasons:

 - You have not installed Microsoft Posting Acceptor 2.0. This is the most
   common reason.

 - You have selected FTP as the Web publishing protocol when you are using an
   HTTP address as a destination URL.

 - You are missing a <META> tag at the top of your default document
   specified for your root Web. The PDW requests the default document for your
   root Web and looks for the <META> tag in order to determine where your
   PostInfo.asp file is located.

RESOLUTION
==========

Take the following actions, as necessary:

 - Install Posting Acceptor 2.0.

 - Make sure that the destination URL protocol matches the selected Web
   publishing protocol.

 - Check your default document to see that it contains the <META> tag
   shown below and that it is the first line in your document:

   <META name="postinfo" content="/scripts/postinfo.asp">

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
