TITLE   :Upgrading to IIS 5.0 Shows Home Page from Previous IIS Version
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade a computer running Windows NT Server version 4.0 with IIS
version 4.0 or earlier to Windows 2000 with IIS 5.0, when you browse to the
Default Web Site, the default home page appears from the previous version of
IIS.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. Installation of IIS 5.0 does not delete an existing home page
during the upgrade.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the home page from the previous version of IIS is not needed, it may be
deleted. This will allow the IIS 5.0 default page to be displayed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

During the installation of IIS 5.0, the setup process does not create a default
home page named "Default.asp" for the Default Web Site. Instead, it creates a
page named "Iisstart.asp." This page is then added to the list of default
documents. Therefore, a new installation of IIS 5.0 correctly displays this
document as the home page, but an upgrade over a previous version of IIS will
leave the existing default document in place.
