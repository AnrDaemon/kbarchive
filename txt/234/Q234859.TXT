======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using Windows Installer-based applications, the shortcuts that populate the
Start menu display the Missing Shortcut dialog box with the "searching
flashlight," and fail to find the target path of the shortcut.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur in situations where the application is damaged, or when
the application is assigned in the Active Directory and the user attempts to
start the application by using the shortcut. The Windows Installer is attempting
to repair the installation or install new features.

This problem occurs because the shell update in Internet Explorer 4.01 or higher
is necessary to allow the Windows Installer to create the correct shortcut to
enable the Windows Installer to perform application repair and assignments for
the application's features.

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify that the Shell32.dll version is 4.72.3110 or greater. Shell32.dll is
found in the %systemroot%\System32 folder. Right-click the file and click
Properties, and then click the Version tab. The version entry should be viewable
on the File version: line.

If the version number is less than 4.72.3110, install the Windows Desktop Update
that ships with Internet Explorer 4.01 Service Pack 1 (SP1).

STATUS
======

This is by design of the Windows Installer and the Windows Desktop Update.
