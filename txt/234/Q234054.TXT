The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During the text-mode portion of Windows NT Setup, you may receive the following
error message after Setup detects all SCSI adapters and then proceeds to copy
files for installation:

   Setup did not find any hard disk drives installed in your system.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because any SCSI adapter that requires updated original
equipment manufacturer (OEM) drivers must be detected last if that SCSI adapter
is the controller for the disk drive that will contain the system partition. If
you are installing to a drive that is connected to an unsupported SCSI adapter
that requires updated OEM drivers, that unsupported SCSI adapter is the first
adapter to be detected, and without the correct SCSI driver, Setup returns the
error message that the drive can not be found.

RESOLUTION
==========

The SCSI adapter requires that Setup detect updated OEM drivers correctly. To
resolve this behavior, add that driver after Setup detects all other SCSI
adapters in the computer. If you are adding more than one SCSI driver during
Setup, you must add the driver for the adapter that is associated with the drive
that the system partition will be located on last.
