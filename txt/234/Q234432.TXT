TITLE   :XADM: Running Isinteg May Truncate Databases to 8 KB
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you receive one or more of the following events or error messages, visible
from Event Viewer or command prompt, while attempting to start the Microsoft
Exchange Server information store, and if you then run Isinteg, it may truncate
the database file to 8 KB.

Sample error message in Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 0
   Source: ESE97
   Type: Error
   Category: Logging/Recovery
   Description: MSExchangeIS ((451)) -1019

Sample command prompt error message:

   A service specific error occurred: 4294966277

CAUSE
=====

Isinteg has encountered a damaged page in the Microsoft Exchange database and
the page appears to be uninitialized but it is actually in use. Only certain
pages that have become damaged will cause this to happen and therefore, the
chances are small this problem will occur.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

| 5.5.2632  | Ese.dll | 
+---------------------+


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 2. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server
5.5 Service Pack 3.
