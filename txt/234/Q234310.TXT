SUMMARY
=======

DirLV.exe is a sample that demonstrates how to implement an Explorer-like
ListView control. The control handles some user-defined messages that make it
display the contents of a specified directory. The ListView control displays the
associated icon, the long file name, the size of the file, the file type, its
creation date, and the file attributes.

The sample illustrates how to:

 - Use the system image list in an MFC application to display the icon
   associated with every file.
 - Implement the ListView control as a virtual ListView, that is, specify
   LVS_OWNERDATA as a style for the ListView control. This causes the system to
   send LVN_GETDISPINFO notifications to the control's parent for every item in
   the list that needs to be displayed. This approach greatly improves
   performance for large directories.
 - Implement mouse and keyboard navigation: double-clicking a directory, or
   pressing ENTER when the focus item is a directory, changes the displayed
   directory.
 - Use a fast sorting algorithm provided in the Standard Template Library (STL),
   to order the files alphabetically.

The sample does not use ITEMIDLISTs to identify shell elements (that is, files)
nor does it use any of the associated shell interfaces. As a consequence, it
does not recognize link files as such, it does not handle virtual directories,
and it fails to identify an icon for console applications that don't have an
icon associated with them.
