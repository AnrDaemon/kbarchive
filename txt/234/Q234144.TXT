TITLE   :DNS Boot File Directives and Configuration for Windows NT 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0

KEYWORDS:kbenv kbDNS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT 4.0 Domain Name System (DNS) supports the directives (or commands)
listed in this article. You can use these directives in a boot file in the
%SystemRoot%\System32\DNSfile folder or in the EnableRegistryBoot registry key
to start DNS with the settings you want. The boot file specifies the startup
parameters for DNS. Directives must start at the beginning of a line with no
preceding spaces.

The recognized and supports commands are:

   cache
   primary
   secondary
   forwarders
   slave
   options

NOTE: Support for the directory directive was removed after the "DNS and
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0" white paper was published. This directive is no longer
supported as referenced by the white paper.

NOTE: Support for the options directive, which is not listed in the "DNS and
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0" white paper, is available with Service Pack 4 or later
for Windows NT 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Cache
-----

Specifies a cache file used to help the DNS service contact a name server for the
ROOT domain. This command and the file it refers to must be present. A cache
file suitable for use on the Internet is provided with the Windows NT 4.0 DNS
service.

Syntax: cache . <filename>

Example:

   cache . cache.dns

A cache file contains host information that is needed to resolve names outside
the authoritative domains and contains names and addresses of root name
servers.

The Windows NT 4.0 DNS service provides a default cache file containing name
server information for the ROOT domain on the Internet. By default, this file is
located in the %SystemRoot%\System32\DNS folder. This is sufficient for users on
the Internet.
For installations not connected to the Internet, modify the file to contain the
name servers authoritative for the root of your private networks.

A current Internet cache file is available at:

   ftp://rs.internic.net/domain/named.cache

Microsoft provides third-party contact information to help you find technical
support. This contact information may change without notice. Microsoft does not
guarantee the accuracy of this third-party contact information.

Primary
-------

Specifies a domain for which this name server is authoritative and a database
file that contains the resource records for that domain (that is a zone file).
Multiple "primary" command records could exist in the boot file.

Syntax: primary <domain><filename>

Examples:

   primary microsoft.com microsoft.com.dns
   primary PSS.microsoft.com pss.microsoft.com.dns

Secondary
---------

Specifies a domain for which this name server is authoritative, and a list of
master server IP addresses from which to attempt downloading the zone
information, rather than reading it from a file. It also defines the name of the
local file for caching this zone. Multiple "secondary" command records could
exist in the boot file.

Syntax: secondary <domain><master-host><local-filename>

Examples:

   secondary BP.microsoft.com 120.120.120.1 bp.microsoft.com.dns
   secondary BOS.microsoft.com 130.130.130.1 bos.microsoft.com.dns

Forwarders
----------

Specifies another server that is willing to try resolving recursive queries on
behalf of the system.

Syntax: forwarders <server-list>

Example:

   forwarders 120.120.120.1 130.130.130.1

Slave
-----

Specifies that the use of forwarders is the only possible way to resolve queries.
This can only follow a forwarders directive.

Syntax: slave

Example:

   forwarders 120.120.120.1 130.130.130.1
   slave

Options
-------

Specifies optional configuration parameters. Currently, the only "option"
directive supported with the boot file is: no-recursion. Non-recursion specifies
that the DNS name server sends non-recursive queries to other name servers.

Syntax: options no-recursion

Example:

   options no-recursion

The Boot File
-------------

The boot file is a BIND-specific implementation and is not a requirement of the
IETF RFCs. This feature is provided for easy migration from BIND-based DNS
servers. For more information about configuring the DNS server to boot from a
boot file, see the "EnableRegistryBoot" and "BootMethod" sections in the
following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

   Q198408 Microsoft DNS Server Registry Parameters, Part 1 of 3

Although the DNS white paper still lists the directory directive, this directive
is not supported. If you use the directory directive in the boot file, the
following event is recorded in the Event log, stating that an unsupported
directory directive was used:

   DNS Parsing Error
