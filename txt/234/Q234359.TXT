======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Programs sometimes stop responding (hang) when you perform a File-Save
operation. The problem only affects programs that employ structured storage in
transacted mode.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because in certain situations, the FAT header in the doc
file contains the wrong size information. This causes the structured storage
code to go into an infinite loop.
