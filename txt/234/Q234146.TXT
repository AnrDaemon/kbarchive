TITLE   :BUG: ATL Consumer Wizard truncates SQL Server Field to TCHAR

SYMPTOMS
========

The ATL consumer wizard maps DBTYPE_STR fields, such as SQL Server's text
fields, to TCHAR arrays of 1024 bytes instead of an ISequentialStream pointer.
The data for the columns is truncated to 1024 bytes.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design.

RESOLUTION
==========

If data larger than 1024 is expected, you can increase the size of the array in
your accessor class. For example, by default your code may look like the
following:

   TCHAR m_TextColumn[1024];
   ...
   COLUMN_ENTRY(3, m_TextColumn);

Change the 1024 to the desired maximum length of the data.

Another alternative is to use ISequentialStream to retrieve and set the data.
ISequentialStream allows an application to read and write pieces at a time and a
predefined maximum buffer size is not required. You would change the code above
to:

   ISequentialStream * m_TextColumn;
   ...
   BLOB_ENTRY(3, IID_ISequentialStream, STGM_READ,m_TextColumn);

REFERENCES
==========

See Q190958 AOTBLOB for example of how to read and update using an
ISequentialStream pointer.
