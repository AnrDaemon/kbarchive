TITLE   :XADM: Changing Database Paths Using the Administrator Program
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can manually move Exchange Server databases using the Exchange Server
Administrator program, instead of moving them using Performance Optimizer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the following procedure to move Exchange Server databases:

1. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, click the <server name>
   object, and on the File menu, click Properties, and then click the Database
   Paths tab.

2. Select the database that you want to move, and click Modify. You can also
   double-click on the selected database.

3. Before you move the database, create the appropriate directory on the
   destination drive. For example, if you want to move the Dir.edb file from the
   C:\Exchsrvr\Dsadata folder to drive D, create the D:\Exchsrvr\Dsadata folder
   first.

4. After you modify all the database paths, click OK.

5. The following message is displayed:

   You have altered a server database path. In order to change the path the
   corresponding service(s) will be stopped, the files will be moved, and then
   the service(s) will be restarted.

   Are you sure you want to alter the database path(s)?

6. To proceed with the operation, click Yes, or to cancel, click No.

NOTE: For performance reasons, Microsoft recommends that you use local hard disk
drives on the computer and not network shared drives.

Only perform this procedure if you are not implementing major changes. Examples
of major changes include, but are not limited to, the following:

 - Adding or deleting a large amount of users.

 - Adding and deleting connectors.

 - Adding or removing hardware.

Additional query words: Logs, registry
