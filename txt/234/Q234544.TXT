TITLE   :Cluster Bottleneck Occurs When a Large Number of Disks Are Invol
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

"High-end" computer systems (especially large FibreChannel installations) that
have a large number of hard disks may experience slow response times.

CAUSE
=====

This is because of the number of times the bus is reset. Each reset process can
stop the entire bus for seconds at a time. When a large number of hard disks are
involved, this time can grow to minutes.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem was fixed by reducing the number of bus resets performed, while
maintaining the requirement of finding the correct disk device when needed.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft

STATUS

first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5.
