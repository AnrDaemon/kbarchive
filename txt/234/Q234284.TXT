TITLE   :"Path not found" Error Occurs When Saving Component Library
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0 SP2,4.0SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsna400sp2

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 4.0 SP2 
 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS (COMTI) Component
Builder (CB), an attempt is made to save a component library, which produces the
following error message:

   Path not found.

The same error message may also be displayed when you use functions like copy,
paste, or drag and drop.

CAUSE
=====

The application seeks a directory to store temporary files it uses. It gets this
directory by calling GetTempPath (a windows base services function). It first
looks for a TMP environment variable, then a TEMP environment variable, and if
neither of these is defined, GetTempPath returns the path to the Windows
directory. It does not check to see if the path actually exists. This article
describes the situation where the environment variable has a path to a directory
that does not exist.

WORKAROUND
==========

Create the directory specified by the TEMP or TMP environment variable.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version
4.0.
