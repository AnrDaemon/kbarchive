TITLE   :BUG: VBCE Winsock Control Might Not Receive Binary Data
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbToolkit kbVBp600bug kbOSWinCEsearch kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Winsock control to try to receive binary data (that is, a
bitmap, and so forth), you might only receive a subset of your data. In the
DataArrival event, you can verify that the correct number of bytes is received,
but you cannot get all of the data using the GetData method.

The documentation for the GetData method of the Windows CE Winsock Control
incorrectly states:

   GetData supports only strings and arrays of integers. It is common to use the
   GetData method with the DataArrival event.

The Winsock control for the Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 only supports
strings.

CAUSE
=====

The CE Winsock control only retrieves data to the first ASCII 0 it receives, and
then it stops.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Windows CE H/PC or H/PC Pro project in Visual Basic. Form1 will
   be created by default. The application runs in emulation by default.

2. Select Components from the Project menu and add the Microsoft CE Winsock
   Control to the project.

3. Add a command button to Form1.

4. Copy a bitmap or other binary file to the root of your Web server's content
   directory.

5. Paste the following code into Form1:

   Private Sub Form_Load
       'Note: replace with your Web server's IP address
       Winsock1.RemoteHost = "127.0.0.1" 
       Winsock1.Protocol = sckTCPProtocol
       Winsock1.RemotePort = 80
       Winsock1.Connect   
   End Sub

   Private Sub WinSock1_DataArrival(ByVal bytesTotal As Long)
       Dim strData   
       Winsock1.GetData strData
       MsgBox "Bytes Total is " & bytesTotal & " data is " & strData
   End Sub

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
     'You can replace lanmannt.bmp with the name of the file
     'you put in your Web server's content directory
     Winsock1.SendData "GET /lanmannt.bmp" & vbCrLf & vbCrLf
   End Sub

6. Run the application and click the command button.

Note that you receive only a portion of the data from the bitmap, and you are not
able to receive any more data until the program is reset.
