The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 SP3

SYMPTOMS
========

If you connect to an Exchange Server computer using the Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol (LDAP) and Basic (Clear Text) authentication, and then bind to
the server, you may be unable to perform an LDAP search on the directory.

CAUSE

on the computer from which you are running the search.
