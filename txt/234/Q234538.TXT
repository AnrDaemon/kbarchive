TITLE   :New Cryptographic APIs Need Backwards Compatibility
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Calls to the WINTRUST APIs may not work if an older encryption software
development kit (SDK) was used to create these calls. These calls usually do not
work because of differences in supported structure sizes between the two
versions.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the encryption support file (Softpub.dll) that is
included in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 is not backwards compatible with the
encryption APIs with regard to structure size.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
