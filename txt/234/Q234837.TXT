TITLE   :MOD2000: Renamed Objects Lose Connection to VSS
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER::; WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Office 2000 Developer 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you rename an object that you have checked out by using the VBA Source
Code Control Add-in, you receive the following error message:

   457: This key is already associated with an element of this collection.

If you then try to check the object in, you receive the following message:

   You do not have any files checked out from Source Code Control.

If you then refresh the Source Code Control (SCC) Status list, you see that the
object is renamed, but also that it is removed from source code control.

RESOLUTION
==========

To regain the Source Code Control connection, rename the object back to its
original name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Problem
------------------------------

1. Install Microsoft Office 2000 Professional.

2. Install Microsoft Visual SourceSafe 6.0, which is available on the Microsoft
   Office 2000 Developer CD.

3. Open Visual SourceSafe Explorer, and then create a new SourceSafe database
   named "test" (without the quotation marks).

4. Close Visual SourceSafe Explorer.

5. Open Microsoft Excel 2000, and then save the current workbook as Book1.xls.

6. Open the Visual Basic Editor by pressing ALT+F11.

7. Click the Add-ins menu. If you do not have the VBA Visual Source Code Control
   add-in installed, you can load it by clicking Add-in Manager on the Add-ins
   menu, clicking VBA Source Code Control, and then clicking to select the
   Load/Unload check box.

8. Create a new project, and then save it.

9. On the Add-ins menu, click VBA Source Code Control, and then add the current
   project to Microsoft Visual SourceSafe.

10. Check out Sheet1.

11. In the Properties window, modify the (Name) property to rename Sheet1 to
   "NewName" (without the quotation marks). Note that after you enter the name,
   you receive the following message:

   457: This key is already associated with an element of this collection.

12. Click OK and try to check Sheet1 into Visual Source Safe. Note that you
   receive the following message:

   You do not have any files checked out from Source Code Control.

13. On the Add-ins menu, click VBA Source Code Control, and then click Refresh
   File Status. Note that the sheet is renamed to NewName and is no longer
   under Source Code Control.

14. However, if you then open the Visual SourceSafe Explorer, Sheet1 is still
   checked out and maintains the complete object history.

   At this point, if you rename the NewName sheet to Sheet1, the connection to
   Source Code Control is restored.
