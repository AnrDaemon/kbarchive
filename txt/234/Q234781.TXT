SUMMARY
=======

The Universal Disk Format (UDF) file system is not supported in any release of
Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

UDF is a file system defined by the Optical Storage Technology Association
(OSTA) for DVD. UDF is compliant with ISO-13346 and is the successor to the
CD-ROM file system (CDFS or ISO-9660). All DVD-based devices should be able to
read a DVD-ROM disc, including:

 - Double-sided, double-layered discs, which will hold up to 17 gigabytes (GB)
   of data.

 - DVD-WO (also known as DVD-R), a variation of DVD-ROM that supports one-time
   recording capabilities, similar to CD-R.

 - DVD-RAM, a variation of DVD-ROM that supports multiple recording
   capabilities, similar in function to magneto optical discs.

DVD-Video (also known as DVD-Movie) is a disc that contains digital, highly
compressed, multimedia data in the Video Object (VOB) format as specified in the
DVD Specifications, version 1.0. This medium is used to distribute feature films
that can be played back by either a DVD-Video player or a computer with an
installed DVD-ROM drive. These disks require a third-party program for playback
on a Windows 95-based computer.
