TITLE   :XWEB: Installing and Using OWA Language Packs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5

KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Language Packs for Outlook Web Access (OWA) are available for download from the
following location:

   http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/downloads/55/sp4.asp

To ensure you are using the latest Language Pack, upgrade to the latest client
and server service packs. Check your service pack documentation for more
information.

Note: On the Exchange 5.5 Service Pack 3 CD-ROM, OWA language packs can be found
in the \CLIENT\LANGPACK directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you install your selected Language Pack, you can configure Internet
Explorer to use or test the selected language by following the steps below.

1. In Internet Explorer, type the URL to access the OWA logon page, for example,
   "http://<servername>/Exchange" (without the quotation marks); in HTTP
   Get Request, the browser displays an Accept-Language field. The value of this
   field depends upon the language preferences set in Internet Explorer.

2. To set language preferences in Internet Explorer, on the Tools menu, click
   Internet Options, and then click Languages. In the Language Preference dialog
   box, click Add to add other languages. For example, to add French, in the Add
   Language dialog box, select French (France) [fr]; this is represented by the
   [fr] language code. You can change the priority of the languages; in the
   Language Preference dialog box, select the language you want to move, and
   then click either Move Up or Move Down accordingly.

3. If you change your language preferences so that French (France) [fr] follows
   English (United States) [en-us], the Accept Language field looks like [fr,
   en-us]. OWA installs an Internet Server Application Programming Interface
   (ISAPI) filter called Exchfilt.dll that handles the Accept Language field and
   redirects browsers to the relevant language folder. In this example, browsers
   using [fr, en-us] would be redirected to <Exchsrvr>\Webdata\Frn. The
   same principle also allows you to view other OWA languages.

NOTE: It might be necessary for you to stop and restart the IISAdmin service
after you install the Russian language pack.

To find out more about this mechanism, install Network Monitor and observe the
behavior of the HTTP protocol between an Internet Explorer client and the OWA
server.

You can find more information on the Accept-Language header file and the
currently defined language codes at the following Web site:
