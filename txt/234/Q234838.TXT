TITLE   :MOD2000: Deleted Modules Not Are Removed from VSS Control
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER::; WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta modSSafe

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Office 2000 Developer 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you remove a module that is under source code control from a VBA project,
you are not prompted to remove it from the Visual SourceSafe project. If you
later create a new module with the same name as the module that you removed, you
will not be able to add it to source code control. The VBA Source Code Control
add-in will return the following error message:

   No files are available to be added to source code control.

CAUSE
=====

When you try to add an object to source code control that has the same name as
an existing object in the Visual SourceSafe project, the VBA Source Code Control
Add-in assumes that the object that you are trying to add is the same one that
you previously removed from the VBA project. This happens even though the file
name does not appear in the SCC Status window.

RESOLUTION
==========

After you remove a module from a VBA project, remove it from source code control
by deleting the corresponding item in the Visual SourceSafe Explorer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create and save a new workbook in Microsoft Excel 2000.

2. Press ALT+F11 to open the Visual Basic Editor.

3. Insert two new modules into the VBA project. Accept the default names Module1
   and Module2.

4. On the File menu, click Save <project name>.

5. Use the Add-in Manager to load the VBA Source Code Control add-in if it is
   not already loaded.

6. On the Add-ins menu, point to VBA Source Code Control, and then click Add
   Project to SourceSafe. Make sure both modules are added to the source code
   control project.

7. Delete Module2 from the VBA project, and then close Excel. Note that you are
   prompted to save the workbook, but you are not prompted to remove the file
   from source code control.

8. Reopen the workbook that you created in step 1, open the Visual Basic Editor,
   and then insert a new module. Accept Module2 as the default name.

9. On the File menu, click Save <project name>.

10. On the Add-ins menu, point to VBA Source Code Control, and then click "Add
   Files to SourceSafe". Note that you receive the error message mentioned in
   the "Symptoms" section.
