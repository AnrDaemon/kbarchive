TITLE   :XFOR: GW Mailbox Gateway Alias Does Not Transfer to Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you configure the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise and
successfully complete directory synchronization between Exchange Server and
GroupWise, some GroupWise custom recipients fail to inherit their original
gateway alias as their SMTP proxy address.

The expected behavior is for Exchange Server to use the GroupWise user's gateway
alias as the SMTP proxy address if one is defined specifically for that user.
Exchange Server should only generate an SMTP proxy address for a GroupWise
mailbox if there is no gateway alias defined for that mailbox.

CAUSE
=====

The Gateway Alias Type field in the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Novell
GroupWise is incorrect.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, click the Options tab of the
   Microsoft Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise container. Change the
   Gateway Alias Type field to SMTP.

2. In the GroupWise NetWare Administrator program, in the API Gateway container,
   change the Gateway Alias Type to SMTP.

3. Restart the GroupWise API gateway and the GroupWise ADA. Restart the
   Microsoft Exchange Connector for GroupWise and the Microsoft Exchange Router
   for GroupWise services.

4. After the next directory synchronization, the Exchange Server SMTP proxy
   address should be equal to the gateway alias for that GroupWise mailbox.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
