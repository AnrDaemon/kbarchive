TITLE   :XFOR: Corrupted Message Stops Inbound Traffic, Monopolizes CPU
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A corrupted Lotus cc:Mail message (.ccm) file may cause the Microsoft Exchange
Connector for Lotus cc:Mail to use up to 90 percent of the CPU and subsequently
stop the processing of all inbound mail messages.

CAUSE
=====

The 'Contents:' field is mandatory in a cc:Mail message. If the cc:Mail message
is missing this field because of corruption in the body, the cc:Mail Connector
loops indefinitely.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

+---------------------+
| Ccmsg.dll | 2623.0  | 
+---------------------+


WORKAROUND
==========

You can remove the corrupted cc:Mail message by stopping the Microsoft Exchange
cc:Mail Connector service, and then deleting the stuck message in the
Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Export folder.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.

Additional query words: ccmail, stuck message, high CPU, 100%
