TITLE   :Logon Script Does Not Work Due to Net.bat File in Netlogon Share
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The logon script for a Windows NT client may not work or may go into a
continuous loop, which may cause the Windows NT-based computer to stop
responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if there is a file named Net.bat in the Netlogon share
and the logon script contains a NET USE command. When you use the NET USE
command in the logon script, the Net.bat file in the Netlogon share is run.

If a logon script contains the NET USE command, the current folder is checked for
an executable file named "Net." If the current folder contains a file named
Net.bat, the Net.bat file is run instead of the Net.exe file in the
%SystemRoot%\System32 folder, even though this folder is on the path. Note that
this behavior occurs with any NET command in a logon script (for example, the
NET TIME or NET USE commands).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, rename the Net.bat file or remove it from the Netlogon
share.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem does not occur with Microsoft Windows 95 clients.
