TITLE   :Files Not Found Using SCM with Terminal Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you examine the log file in Security Configuration Manager (SCM), the
following error message may be displayed in the Analyze File Security section:

   The system cannot find the file specified.
   Error querying security of <userprofile>\windows\<filename>.

NOTE: This error message may be displayed even if SCM is functioning correctly.
In this case, the error message contains the actual path to the folder where
Terminal Server is installed. The error message indicates only that a file
listed in the .inf file is not present. This may or may not indicate a problem.
Check to see if the file is present in the location specified.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because Terminal Server is in Execution mode (change user
/execute).

The security template files that SCM uses contain the environment variable
%SystemRoot% to specify the location of files and the desired NTFS security
settings for those files. When you use SCM to analyze or configure security
settings on the system, SCM queries the system for the path for the Windows NT
folder (%SystemRoot%). Terminal Server returns the <userprofile>\Windows
folder. Error messages are generated when SCM cannot find the files it is
looking for in the user's profile folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, put the system into Install mode before using SCM. To do
this, type the following command at a command prompt:

   "change user /install" (without the quotation marks)

NOTE: Before users log on to the system, make sure you return the system to
Execute mode. To do this, type the following command at a command prompt:

   "change user /execute" (without the quotation marks)
