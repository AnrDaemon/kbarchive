KEYWORDS:kbMMC kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms120 kbsms120bug kbsmsAdmin

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On sites with a large number of packages, the Microsoft Management Console (MMC)
Administrator Console may display a message box titled "Internal Error" when you
attempt to open or refresh one of the nodes under Package Status. The message
box text is:

   An error occurred during your last operation. Please shut down the Systems
   Management Server Administrator's Console and restart it. For debugging
   information, press the More Information button.

The message box may take a long time to come up. If you press the More
Information button on the message box, it usually looks like the following:

   _com_error exception in MMC Admin UI!

   Description:	Factory Enumeration Failure
   HRESULT:	0xEEEE0001
   File:	E:\OPAL\mmcadminui\Support\SMS_NMGR\NMGR_NodeData.cpp
   Line:	221
   <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
   Description:	XXXXX

In the text above, XXXXX is usually something like:

   SQL Err>> DBProcess is DEAD or not enabled.
   SQL Err>> Invalid operator for datatype op: UNKNOWN TOKEN

Or some other text indicating that there is a problem with the SQL Server.

Other symptoms include an access violation (AV) in SQL Server. Additionally, the
connection between the SMS Provider and SQL Server may stop responding. The SMS
Provider will time out in about 10 minutes. When this happens, the Package
Status nodes in the MMC Administrator Console will show the hourglass and appear
to have stopped responding until the "Internal Error" message box comes up.


WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
