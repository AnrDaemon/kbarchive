TITLE   :BUG: "This Stub Requires an Updated Version of <Rpcndr.h>" Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCOMt kbVC kbOSWinCEsearch kbGrpDSMFCATL

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual C++ 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Compiling a Windows CE project may generate the following compiler error:

   fatal error C1189: #error : this stub requires an updated version of
   <rpcndr.h>

CAUSE
=====

You'll get this error if you include a MIDL-generated header file. These header
files use newer macros, like MIDL_INTERFACE(), which is only defined in later
versions of Rpcndr.h.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can #include <wceatl.h> before #including any MIDL-generated header
files. Wceatl.h contains a definition for MIDL_INTERFACE() and works around the
compiler error by #defining __RPCNDR_H_VERSION__.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
