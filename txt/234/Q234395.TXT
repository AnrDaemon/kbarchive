TITLE   :XADM: Folder with Slash Mark (/) Cannot Be Seen By IMAP4 Clients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use an IMAP4 e-mail client, not all of the public folders are displayed
in the list of public folders.

CAUSE
=====

The public folders that aren't visible contain a slash mark (/) in the public
folder name. The slash mark is designed as hierarchy delimiter in IMAP and is
used to delimit levels of hierarchy in a mailbox name.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the folder name to eliminate the slash mark. The following characters are
valid in public folder names:

   Tilde ~
   Exclamation point !
   At sign @
   Number sign #
   Dollar sign $
   Percent %
   Caret ^
   Ampersand &
   Asterisk *
   Parentheses ()
   Braces {}
   Brackets []
   Apostrophe '
   Underscore _
   Hyphen -
   Equal sign =
   Plus sign +
   Vertical bar |

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Behavior
-------------------------------

1. Create a public folder whose name contains the slash mark.

2. Use an IMAP client or telnet command to download the folder list.

3. Log on to a MAPI e-mail client and view the folder list.
