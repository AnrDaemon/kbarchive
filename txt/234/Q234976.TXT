The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW) to deploy an Internet
Information Server (IIS) application to a Web server, you receive the following
error message:

   Unexpected error number C0042116 has occurred: The Web server returned the
   following error: Access Denied.

NOTE: This error message should only occur if you are using Anonymous access.

CAUSE
=====

The Anonymous account (IUSR_<machinename> by default) does not have proper
NT File System (NTFS) permissions to the C:\InetPub\scripts directory and/or to
the directory to which you are deploying. The Anonymous account needs at least
NTFS Read and Execute (RX) permissions to the C:\InetPub\scripts directory and
NTFS Change (RWXD) permissions to the deployment directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Assign the Anonymous account Read and Execute permissions to the
C:\InetPub\scripts directory and assign Change permissions to your deployment
directory.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
