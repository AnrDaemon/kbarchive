TITLE   :Heap Corruption May Occur When Changing the Properties of SMB
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you repeatedly change the private properties of the Server Message Block
(SMB) share resource (ones that are exposed with "cluster res fileshare /priv"),
heap corruption may occur. This may also cause an access violation error message
to be displayed.

CAUSE
=====

This corruption occurs because the address passed to ResUtilFreeParamaterBlock
is invalid, and this address is eventually passed to LocalFree, causing the
access violation.

==========

additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
