TITLE   :XCON: Hole in Web 3 Connector w. GroupWise 5.5 Internet Agent
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you forward e-mail to an Exchange Server user from a Novell GroupWise 5.5
e-mail system by using the Web 3 Connector, the wrong header may appear in the
e-mail. The sender, recipient, and subject information are incorrect. The
attached original message is lost.

You may be able to change the header with a text editor and attach this new
header to an original new e- mail message, but the erroneous header information
becomes part of the new message and cannot be distinguished from the rest of the
text.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, rename all of your Mime.822 files in the GroupWise
Internet Agent. For example, rename the Mime.822 files to Mime.txt.
