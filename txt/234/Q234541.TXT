TITLE   :STOP 0x00000050 When Source Routing Info Exceeds 18 Bytes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

A STOP 0x0000000A or STOP 0x000000050 error message may be displayed after a
call to MacLookupSourceRouting() when source routing information exceeds 18
bytes in length.

CAUSE
=====

SourceRoutingBuffer is allocated as a UCHAR[18] on the stack. The 802.5
specification states that source routing can be up to 31 bytes in length.
Originally, this length was 18 bytes to allow seven hops. Later, it was changed
to 31 bytes. When MacLookupSourceRouting finds the media access control entry,
it fills in the 31 bytes of Source Routing into the caller's parameters. This
causes corruption in the stack.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

STATUS

first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5.
