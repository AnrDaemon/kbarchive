The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Office 2000 Developer 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Visual Basic Editor integration with Microsoft Visual SourceSafe allows
multiple developers to collaborate on a VBA project. To enable multiuser
development, you must install Visual SourceSafe correctly on all development
(client) computers and on the Visual SourceSafe server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In a multiuser development environment, the Visual SourceSafe database is on one
computer that is called the server, and each developer has a local installation
of the Visual SourceSafe client.

To set up Visual SourceSafe for multiuser development, follow these steps:

1. Install Visual SourceSafe on the server. Run the Visual SourceSafe Setup
   program from the Other Developer Applications option of Microsoft Office 2000
   Developer Tools Setup.

2. In Setup, when you are prompted, click the Shared Database Server option, and
   make sure you install the program to a folder on the server.

3. Share the folder in which you installed the program and make sure that all
   users have the correct permissions to the share.

4. From each development computer (client), run Netsetup.exe, which is located
   in the install folder on the server. This installs a Visual SourceSafe client
   that accesses the database on the server for each user. After the
   installation is finished, run the Visual SourceSafe Explorer on the client,
   and then close it.

5. Also, on each development computer, install the Developer Addins and ActiveX
   Controls from the Office 2000 Developer Tools option of the Microsoft Office
   2000 Developer Tools Setup.
