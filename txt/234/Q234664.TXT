TITLE   :BUG: Containers Show <Unknown Verb> for MFC Static OCXs
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbActiveX kbCOMt kbContainer kbCtrl kbCtrlCreate kbMFC kbVC600bug kbGrpDSMFCATL

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++.NET (2002) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an ActiveX control linked to an MFC static library is placed in a test
container, the Edit/ActiveX control object menu item shows <unknown verb>
menu items instead of names of verbs available on the object, such as edit &
properties.

When the same control is placed on a dialog in Visual C++ resource editor, the
context menu shows <unknown verb> menu items under ActiveXcontrol object
sub menu.

When the same control is placed on a Visual Basic form, the context menu shows
<unknown verb> menu items.

CAUSE
=====

String resources for these verbs are defined in Afxctl.rc. This file is not
included in an ActiveX control project by default. When project settings are
changed to link to MFC static library, this file should be included in the
project by Visual C++ IDE.

RESOLUTION
==========

 - Open an ActiveX control project in IDE.

 - Select the view/resource includes menu item.

 - Add #include <afxctl.rc> statement in compile-time directives list.

 - Ignore the warning you receive when you click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION

   Insert Object dialog in step 2.

2. Select Project/Settings.

3. Change Use MFC in shared DLL to Use MFC in static library.

4. Insert the control in the test container.

5. Select Edit/ActiveX control object to see <unknown verb> entries.
