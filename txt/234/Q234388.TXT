SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message with a zero-byte attachment from Novell GroupWise to an
Exchange Server user, the message is not delivered and a non-delivery report
(NDR) is not generated.

CAUSE
=====

The Novell GroupWise API Gateway does not process messages that contain a
zero-byte attachment. The API Gateway reports "Error processing message
attachments," and orphans the message body in the Att_out folder.
