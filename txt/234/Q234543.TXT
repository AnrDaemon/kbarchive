TITLE   :Internet Explorer Installs Newer Encryption Files on SP3 but Not
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 on a computer running Windows NT
4.0 Service Pack 3, new encryption files are installed. However, when you
install Internet Explorer 5 on a computer running Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4,
these encryption files are not updated, even though they are older files.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because of a file versioning problem. Even though the files
are older, their version was higher and thus, they were not overwritten. This
behavior has been corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5 (SP5) so that both
Internet Explorer 5 and SP5 install the same version of these encryption files.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0. This problem was
first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5.
