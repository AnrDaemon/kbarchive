TITLE   :Cannot Telnet into a Sun Solaris or HP-UX Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbnetwork kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Windows NT Services for UNIX Add-On Pack 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Windows NT Services for UNIX Add-On Pack 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to Telnet to a Sun Solaris or Hewlett-Packard HP-UX server
using the Microsoft Services for Unix console client with the preferred terminal
type configured as VTNT, you are unable to initiate a communication session
between the client and host computers.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs during the negotiation of the terminal type between the
Telnet client and the Solaris or HP-UX server. Both Solaris and HP-UX accept the
VTNT terminal type, but cannot send VTNT information back to the client during
the negotiation phase, which results in an incomplete connection attempt.

RESOLUTION
==========

In resolve this problem, set the preferred terminal type on the Telnet client to
either ANSI or VT100.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT Services
for Unix Add-On Pack.
