The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW) to deploy an Internet
Information Server (IIS) application to a Web server, you receive the following
error message:

   Unexpected error number C0042116 has occurred: The Web server returned the
   following error: Cannot move filename "<filename>" to its final
   destination. Further processing has stopped.

CAUSE
=====

The authenticated user does not have proper Windows NT File System (NTFS)
permissions to the C:\InetPub\scripts directory or to the directory you are
deploying to. The authenticated user needs at least NTFS Read and Execute (RX)
permissions to the C:\InetPub\scripts directory and NTFS Change (RWXD)
permissions to the deployment directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Assign the authenticated user Read and Execute permissions to the
C:\InetPub\scripts directory and assign Change permissions to your deployment
directory.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
