SYMPTOMS
========

When deploying to a Web server using the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW),
you see the following error:

   Unexpected error number 40042119 has occurred: There is no PostInfo file on
   the server.

   This error may occur if you have typed an incorrect URL or if the URL does not
   refer to a correctly configured Web server. Ensure that the URL is correct
   and the Web server is properly configured. For proper configuration, you may
   need to install Microsoft Visual Studio's server-side setup on the Web
   server.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because of the following reasons:

 - The Web service is not running.

 - The PostInfo.asp file is missing or is not located in the InetPub\scripts
   physical directory.

 - You do not have NTFS Read and Execute (RX) permissions to the InetPub\scripts
   directory.

 - The <META> tag in default document (typically named Default.htm) in the
   root directory of the Web is pointing to the incorrect location for
   PostInfo.asp.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the following steps to work around this problem:

 - Make sure the Web service is running.

 - Make sure PostInfo.asp is loated in the InetPub\scripts directory. By
   default, the Microsoft Posting Acceptor 2.0 installs the PostInfo.asp and
   Cpshost.dll files to the InetPub\scripts directory.

 - Make sure the user has NTFS Read and Execute (RX) permissions to the
   InetPub\scripts directory.

 - Make sure your default document has the following <META> tag on the
   first line and the "content" parameter points to a valid location for the
   PostInfo.asp file as shown below:

   <META name="postinfo" content="/scripts/postinfo.asp">

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
