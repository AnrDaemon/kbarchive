KEYWORDS:kbdta modSSafe

SYMPTOMS
========

If you delete the VSSODE module from a project that is under source code
control, the source code control menu options change so that it looks like the
project is no longer under source code control, and you cannot re-establish the
connection to the Visual SourceSafe project. You do not receive a warning if you
choose to delete the VSSODE module.

CAUSE
=====

The VSSODE module contains information that is essential to maintaining your
application under source code control. If you delete this module, you lose the
connection to the objects in the Visual SourceSafe project.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not delete the VSSODE module. It is impossible to reconnect to the original
project in Visual SourceSafe if this file is deleted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new workbook in Microsoft Excel and save it.

2. Press ALT+F11 to open the Visual Basic Editor.

3. If the VBA Source Code Control add-in is not already loaded, use the Add-in
   Manager to load it.

4. On the Add-ins menu, point to VBA Source Code Control, and then click "Add
   Project to SourceSafe".

5. In the Visual Basic Editor Project Explorer, delete the VSSODE module.

Note that the Source Code Control menu option is available, but it looks like the
project is not under source code control.
