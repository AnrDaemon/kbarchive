TITLE   :PRB: VC++ 6.0 Setup Does Not Copy the CRT Make Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbCRT kbVC600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to build the Visual C++ 6.0 CRT Libraries, the build fails
immediately with an error similar to the following:

   NMAKE : fatal error U1073: don't know how to make 'st'

-or-

   NMAKE : fatal error U1064: MAKEFILE not found and no target specified

CAUSE
=====

After selecting the option to copy the C-Runtime (CRT) source code selected
during Visual C++ 6.0 installation, the setup program does not copy the
following files that are necessary to build the CRT Libraries:

   MAKEFILE
   MAKEFILE.SUB
   MAKEFILE.INC

RESOLUTION
==========

The missing files are available on Disk 1 of the Visual C++ CD in the
VC98\CRT\SRC directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Makefile contains all the necessary information about which switches are to
be used when rebuilding the CRT libraries.

The CRT source is provided primarily for debugging purposes. Microsoft does not
recommend rebuilding the CRT libraries and may not be able to provide support
for problems encountered when using rebuilt CRT libraries.
