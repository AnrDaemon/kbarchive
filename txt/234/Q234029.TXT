TITLE   :Err Msg: "Temp Directory Not Accessible" After Applying TSE SP4
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 4
(SP4), error messages similar to the following may be displayed:

   temp directory not accessible

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because Terminal Server SP4 does not reset the permissions
or delete existing temporary folders that are orphaned after a dirty shutdown.
This behavior change was added in SP4 to improve security by preventing new
users from viewing work that may have been abandoned by previous sessions
because of a dirty shutdown.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

   Q186516 Terminal Server Commands: FLATTEMP

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal
Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT Server 4.0,
Terminal Server Edition, Service Pack 5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Normally, Terminal Server session temporary folders are removed by WINLOGON when
a user logs off or the session is reset. However, a dirty shutdown orphans the
temporary directories for any active or disconnected sessions. A dirty shutdown
occurs when the server crashes because of hardware problems, software problems,
or power disruption. In addition, a regression introduced in SP4 winlogon may
cause a dirty shutdown when a server is restarted without a user logged on to
the console.

Note that the hotfix listed in this article does not address the issue of folders
not being deleted at logoff; it only ensures that if the folder already exists
and a user logging on gets assigned the same temporary folder, that permissions
for the existing folder will be set correctly for the new user. EMP folders may
still exist.
