SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the concept of server location in Exchange Server and
explains how to use server location to better control public folder access.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you design a large Exchange Server organization, you generally want to
create and maintain fewer, larger sites. If you keep the number of sites to a
minimum, it is easier to administer the Exchange Server organization. However,
public folder access can become an issue in a large Exchange Server
organization.

You can logically group servers in a site into smaller groups by creating server
locations. Specifically, server locations allow more control over public folder
access in a large Exchange Server organization. You can also use server
locations to limit the users who can gain access to the services of a
connector.

A typical way to implement server locations in an Exchange Server site is to
place Exchange Server computers on the same subnet in the same server location.

NOTE: Server locations only apply within a site, not between sites.

To create a server location for an Exchange Server computer:

1. In the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, click the server
   name.

2. On the File menu, click Properties, and then click the General tab.

3. In the Server Location box, type a new location name to replace the default
   none.

4. Click Apply. When the following question is displayed

   Are you sure you want to create the new location '<name_of_new_entry>'?

   click Yes.

Further Considerations on Public Folder Access
----------------------------------------------

The order in which users in a single site gain access to public folders is not
totally random. Users are assigned to a default public folder server. When a
user needs access to the contents of a public folder, the default server is
checked first. If the default server does not respond to the request, the
modulus server, which is a randomly assigned public folder server, is the next
priority. The remaining servers that are available to the user are those servers
that have currently established remote procedure call (RPC) connections,
followed by all of the remaining public folder servers in the site.

If the site is large and contains network connections that have bandwidth issues,
the public folder connection process that is outlined above may be inefficient.
In this case, you can use server locations to direct connection requests and use
the best possible network route.
