======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Secondary Site Server, one of the
following may occur:

 - Processor utilization may be unusually high when the SMS_Executive service is
   running.

 - The drive with Systems Management Server may fill due to large .clf files in
   the Sms\Inboxes\Colleval.box directory.

 - Advertisements targeted for a collection go to all resources that were
   members in the given collection at any time in the past.

 - A backlog of .psd files forms in the Sms\Inboxes\Colleval.box directory on
   the secondary site server.

CAUSE
=====

The collection evaluator thread at secondary sites improperly processes
collection updates.

WORKAROUND
==========

Delete all the files in the Colleval.box directory. The next time the
collections are updated at the parent site, the secondary site server will
regenerate the contents of the sms_root_directory\Inboxes\Colleval.box directory
automatically.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 2.0. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a change or update to a collection occurs, a re-evaluation is triggered at
the secondary sites. The collection evaluator thread at the secondary site then
builds .clf files to represent collection membership at the secondary site
because there is no SQL server database available.

Collection evaluator then appends the updated membership list of a given
collection to the existing .clf file for that collection rather than replacing
the .clf file. The appending action leaves the previous entries that may or may
not still be valid members of the collection in the .clf file. Also, this adds
duplicate information to the .clf file, and slows future processing of the .clf
file because of increased file size.

Eventually the collection evaluator thread can't process updates as fast as
necessary and the collection evaluator develops a backlog of .psd files. When
there is a backlog of .psd files, the collection evaluator thread is constantly
processing resulting in high CPU utilization by the SMS Executive process.
