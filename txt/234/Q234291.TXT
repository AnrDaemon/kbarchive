OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you cancel the Setup program for the Microsoft Exchange Connector for
GroupWise, Lotus Notes, SNADS, or PROFS before it has completed the
installation, the only option is to uninstall the connector before reinstalling
it again.

CAUSE
=====

The Setup program may fail to overwrite a locked file or encounter other
problems during Setup. In most cases, the Setup program will already have copied
all the files over to the Exchconn directory before Setup is cancelled.

WORKAROUND
==========

Run the Setup program again and uninstall the connector. Then run the Setup
program to reinstall the connector.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
