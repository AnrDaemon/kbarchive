TITLE   :XCLN: Exchange 5.5 Upgrade CD Installation Problems
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Exchange Server Outlook Web Access (OWA) may be installed on a
stand-alone Microsoft Internet Information Server computer, separate from
Exchange Server. This is usually done to provide more performance for the OWA
server. However, when you use the Exchange Server 5.5 Upgrade CD to install OWA
on a new IIS server, Setup fails.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Server 5.5 Upgrade CD will only upgrade components that are already
in place. Since no prior Exchange Server components exist on a new IIS server,
Setup has nothing to upgrade.

RESOLUTION
==========

You might resolve this issue by doing one of the following:

 - Run the Exchange Server 5.5 Upgrade CD on a stand-alone IIS computer with the
   Exchange Server 5.0 Active Server Page components already installed.


 - Install the Exchange Server 5.0 ASP components on a stand-alone IIS 3.0
   computer, then run the Exchange Server 5.5 Upgrade CD.


 - Run the Exchange Server 5.5 Upgrade CD on an Exchange Server 5.0 computer
   that is already running the Exchange Server 5.0 ASP components.
