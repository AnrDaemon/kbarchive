PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

Dr. Watson is invoked whenever a user-mode exception occurs. Sometimes, Dr.
Watson stops responding (hangs) and neither the OK or Cancel buttons are
enabled. You may also see an event ID 1000 from perflib in the Application Event
log, stating that Dr. Watson could not gain access to performance data.

CAUSE
=====

There is an extensible counter that is keeping Dr. Watson from being able to
query performance data.

RESOLUTION
==========

Perform the troubleshooting steps in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
article:

   Q152513 Troubleshooting Performance Monitor Counter Problems

Using this article, identify which extensible counter is causing the problem and
either replace the .dll file associated with the counter with an updated file or
disable the counter.

MORE INFORMATION

Misbehaving extensible counters can cause Performance Monitor or other
third-party programs that query performance data to not work as well.
