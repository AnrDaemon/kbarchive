SYMPTOMS
========

If you have installed the AMD-K6-2 Update (Amdk6upd.exe) on a computer running
Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2, 2.1, and you are using Microsoft
Backup to back up data to certain models of floppy disk drives, you may receive
the following error messages:

   Warning: Tape needs to be erased before operation can proceed.

   Microsoft Backup unable to read from the disk or network drive. Quit and
   restart Backup, and then try again.

   Warning: This operation has been canceled by the system.

CAUSE
=====

The version of Vfbackup.vxd (4.00.1112) installed by the original AMD-K6-2
Update does not incorporate the changes to Vfbackup.vxd to alleviate the problem
described above.

RESOLUTION
==========

The AMD-K6-2 Update has been revised to incorporate a newer version of
Vfbackup.vxd.

The English version of the revised update installs a Vfbackup.vxd file with the
following file attributes:

   Date      Time    Version      Size          File name
   ---------------------------------------------------------
   05/25/99  11:14am 4.00.1114    18,197 bytes  Vfbackup.vxd

The English version of the original update installs a Vfbackup.vxd file with the
following file attributes:

   01/15/97  11:12am  4.00.1112   18,197 bytes Vfbackup.vxd

File information is placed in the registry by both the original and current
update in the registry keys noted below. A QfeCheck tool that has the ability to
detect and list this information is also installed.

Note that the revised update removes and replaces the registry information placed
there by the original update. The '(default)' values shown below are the visible
update titles shown by the QfeCheck tool.
