SYMPTOMS

When you add a new project to Visual SourceSafe, you must create a new Visual
SourceSafe project. Visual SourceSafe does not allow you to add objects to an
existing project, even if the project is empty. If you try to use an existing
project name, you receive the following error message:

   Project <name> already exists. You must create a new VSS project to use
   with this VSS project.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you add a new project to Visual SourceSafe control, type a unique name for
the project in the "Create a new project in the folder" box.
