SYMPTOMS
========

Assume that there are two applications, A and B. Application A calls a
Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) to open a file. The file pointer (FILE *pFile) is
stored on the data segment of the DLL. Application A then calls a function in
the DLL to read the record "n" of this file properly. However, if Application B
calls the same function in the DLL to read the same record, the record appears
as random characters.

RESOLUTION
==========

File handles cannot be shared between applications or DLLs. Each application has
its own file handle table. When an fopen() call is made, a file is taken out of
the application's program segment prefix (PSP). For two separate applications to
use the same file, each application must make its own fopen() call, file I/O
calls, and fclose() call.
