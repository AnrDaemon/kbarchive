SUMMARY
=======

The documentation for the open() and sopen() functions indicates that these
functions set errno values, while the fopen() documentation does not explicitly
state this. However, fopen() will set errno for most of the same error
conditions as open() and sopen().

Internally, fopen() calls many of the same low-level routines that open() and
sopen() call. Because these routines set errno on an error, errno is also set
for errors with fopen(). The one errno value that is NOT set with fopen() is
EMFILE. For more information on the exact errno values, refer to the
documentation for open().

This problem was fixed in the Books On-line of Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit
Edition, version 4.0.
