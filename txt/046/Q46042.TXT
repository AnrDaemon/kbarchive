SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail Note message form only accepts text. When you try to paste a
graphic into the body of a Note message, the Macintosh beeps and nothing is
pasted. To send a graphic message, use the Image message form. Both the Note
form and the Image form are included with Mail.

To send a message that contains both a graphic image and text, you can create a
custom form that has a Send screen with both a text field and a graphic field.
With this sort of form, you can enter text in the text field and paste a graphic
image into the graphic field of the form.

Another option is to make the text part of the graphic image before the graphic
is pasted into the Image message form.
