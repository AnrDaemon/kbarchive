SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft C, the documentation for the functions tmpnam(), tempnam() and
_tempnam() states that under certain conditions they create a name that consists
of the path prefix defined by the P_tmpdir entry in STDIO.H. This is ambiguous.
A better way of stating this is that they create a name that consists of a path
prefix to the root of the current drive; this is also what P_tmpdir is defined
as. However, P_tmpdir is defined as the root directory on the default drive,
which is where the created name would reside. However, any modification of
P_tmpdir in STDIO.H does not change the filename that is created.

The documentation states that changing the definition of P_tmpdir or L_tmpnam
does not change the operation of tmpnam(). Nor does it change the operation of
tempnam() or _tempnam(). These two defines are provided only for XENIX/UNIX
portability. The three functions tmpnam(), tempnam() and _tempnam() do not make
use of these two defines.
