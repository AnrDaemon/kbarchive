The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for MS-DOS, versions 2.2, 3.0, 3.11, 3.14, 4.0, 4.01, 4.05, 4.1 
 - Microsoft CodeView for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.05, 3.06, 3.07, 4.0, 4.01, 4.1

SUMMARY
=======

Using CodeView in the dual-monitor mode with a Hercules graphics card as the
primary (application) monitor requires the Hercules card to be configured in the
half mode. Using the Hercules graphics library, the monitor must be configured
using the config(0) function call. This function call is a part of the Hercules
graphics library and does not use Microsoft graphics library or the MSHERC.COM
program. Therefore, this information applies only if you are using the Hercules
graphics libraries. This is NOT the same as using the /h switch with MSHERC.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The first page of the Hercules graphics display card is mapped to memory
location B0000 (same as MDA), and the second page is mapped to B8000. The
CGA/EGA/VGA also use B8000 as the beginning of their video memory. CodeView uses
these two different address to run in the dual- monitor mode, sending the
application output to the primary address, usually located at B8000, and the
CodeView information to the secondary monitor, usually located at B0000.

This works well until a Hercules graphics card is used as the primary monitor (in
graphics mode) and the CGA/EGA/VGA card is used as the secondary monitor. The
Hercules graphics card uses both pages (one at B0000 and the other at B8000) in
the full mode. Therefore, use config(0) and only the first page (B0000) will be
used and CodeView will function properly in dual-monitor mode.
