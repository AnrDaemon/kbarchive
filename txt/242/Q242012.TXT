TITLE   :Performance Monitor Does Not Append the .log File Extension
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to create a performance monitor log file in Performance Monitor
after choosing Save As Log, the .log file extension is not automatically
appended to the name of the file. For example, the file that is created has no
file extension and appears as an unknown file type, and you cannot open this
file in Performance Monitor unless it has the .log extension.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use any of the following methods:

 - Manually add the .log extension to the file name before saving or starting
   the log.

 - Add the .log extension to the unknown file after it has been created.

 - When using the data from box to view a log, type "*.*" (without the quotation
   marks) in the File Name box so that all files are displayed. Select the log
   file that does not have the .log extension.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
