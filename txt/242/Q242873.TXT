SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to secure your Outlook e-mail and other information
when you have to step away from you computer. The options you have depend on
which operating system you are running.

MORE INFORMATION
================

At the application level (Outlook), you can require a password each time the you
start Outlook. To do so:

1. In Outlook, on the Tools menu, click Services.

2. On the Services tab, click Microsoft Exchange Server, and then click
   Properties.

3. Click Advanced, and change the Logon network security setting to None.

This procedure causes the Exchange Server Password dialog box to appear each time
you start Outlook to connect with the Exchange Server computer. However, for
this method to be effective, you must click Exit and Log Off from the File menu
each time you step away from your computer.

At the operating system level, if you use either Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft
Windows 98, or Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, you can use a Screen Saver password to
protect your desktop. To do so:

1. Right-click the desktop, and click Properties. You should see the Display
   Properties dialog box.

2. Click the Screen Saver tab, and click to select the Password Protected check
   box.

3. Click Change, and type a password.

For this method to be effective, set the Wait time to a low number, such as 1
minute. This way, shortly after you step away from your desk, the computer will
be secured.

If you use Windows NT, you also have the option to lock your workstation. To do
so, press CTRL+ALT+DEL at the same time, and then click Lock Workstation. For
