TITLE   :PRB: The Mouse Pointer Cannot Be Changed in a SnapIn Project
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Management Console, versions 1.1, 1.2 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When developing a SnapIn project using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC)
Snap-In Designer for Visual Basic, the ability to change the mouse pointer
(cursor) is not provided.

CAUSE
=====

The MMC specification does not allow a snap-in to change the mouse cursor
because no single snap-in can control the MMC container.

RESOLUTION
==========

An OCX View does allow a mouse pointer to be changed from within the MMC
container. A UserControl container object exposes a MousePointer property that
will allow the mouse pointer to be changed when the pointer is positioned over
the OCX View. The following sample code shows how to use the property:

      UserControl.MousePointer = vbHourglass

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
