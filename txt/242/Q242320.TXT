-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message may be logged multiple times in the application
event log, and e-mail messages may not be delivered or received:

   Event ID - 4122
   MSExchangeIMC
   Description -
   An error occurred while retrieving the originating address of a message to be
   delivered. Since the originating address is needed for mail delivery, the
   mail cannot be delivered. The message that was being processed has been moved
   to the "BAD" folder. Use the appropriate utilities found in the SUPPORT
   directory of your Exchange CD to view and manipulate these messages.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the Network Associates GroupShield antivirus software
is running. The GroupShield software scans e-mail messages at the same time that
the Internet Mail Service is processing them. This results in malformed e-mail
addresses and generates the error message in the "Symptoms" section of this
article, Event ID 4122.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, configure GroupShield to omit the Internet Mail Service
from its scanning routines.

Contact Network Associates for more information.
