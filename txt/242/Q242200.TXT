SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing Team Productivity Update (TPU), you may receive the
following error message (note that the drive letter and space available vary):

   Insufficient Drive Space

   There does not appear to be sufficient disk space available on drive E to
   complete the setup.

   Space Available: 287.5 MB

   Space Required: 566.6 MB

   If you'd like to try to continue the setup anyway, click OK. Otherwise, click
   Cancel.

If you choose to continue with TPU Setup, you receive the following error
message:

   TPUSetup

   Setup was unable to place the Outlook 2000 files on the client share.

   Please review any documentation accompanying your setup for more information
   on why setup may not be working properly. You might also try closing any open
   applications and run setup again.

When you click OK, the Team Productivity Update Setup Wizard indicates that Setup
was not successful. TPU has not been installed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if the drive you choose as the installation drive for TPU
does not have enough free space for the installation.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you receive the first error message, click Cancel, and then change the
destination drive for the Team Productivity Client share to a drive with at
least 566.5 megabytes (MB) of free space.

MORE INFORMATION
================
