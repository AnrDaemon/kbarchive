TITLE   :Cannot Log On to Windows NT Domain Using IPX/SPX and TCP/IP
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to log on to a TCP/IP- and Microsoft Windows NT-based network using
a Microsoft Windows 95-based client, you may not be able to do so. The client
computer may have both TCP/IP and IPX/SPX bound to the network adapter and both
Client for Microsoft Networks and Client for NetWare Networks installed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Windows 95-based client is using IPX/SPX as the
default protocol and the Windows NT Server-based servers are configured for
TCP/IP only. The network logon validation request may time out before TCP/IP
sends a confirmation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, on the Windows 95-based computer, cancel the bindings for
IPX/SPX, and then remove any Novell client software. To do this, follow these
steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Network.

2. Click Configuration.

3. In the list of installed network components, click the network adapter, and
   then click Properties.

4. Click Bindings.

5. Click to clear the IPX/SPX Compatible Protocol and any Novell client software
   check boxes.

6. Click OK, and then click OK again.

7. Click Yes to restart the computer.
