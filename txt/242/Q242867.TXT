TITLE   :PRB: Compile Error when Declaring MSVSAEventSourceInstaller
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbEEdition kbVBp600 kbVisAnalyzer kbVS600 kbDSupport kbGrpDSTools kbVSVisAnalyzer

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Studio, Enterprise Edition 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When compiling a Visual Basic project that accesses the Visual Studio Analyzer
programming interfaces, the following error may occur:

   Compiler error:
   Expected user-defined type, not project

CAUSE
=====

The project contains references to both the automatable (Visual Basic and Visual
J++) and non-automatable (Visual C++) interfaces.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the references to the non-automatable interfaces from Project References.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To access the Visual Studio Analyzer programming interfaces from within Visual
Basic, you need to add two type library references to your Visual Basic project.
Once you add the type library references, you can access the methods within the
programming interfaces using the Object Browser.

The following libraries are provided for use with Visual Basic:

 - MSVSA Automatable Event Source Installer 1.0 Type Library

 - MSVSA Automatable Inproc Event Creator 1.0 Type Library

The following libraries are provided for use with Visual C++ and should not be
referenced in a Visual Basic project:

 - MSVSA Event Source Installer 1.0 Type Library

 - MSVSA Inproc Event Creator 1.0 Type Library

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Visual Basic project of type ActiveX DLL.

2. Add references for both the MSVSA Automatable Event Source Installer 1.0 Type
   Library and the MSVSA Event Source Installer 1.0 Type Library.

3. Declare an object as follows:

   Dim mESI As MSVSAEventSourceInstaller

4. Save the project.

5. Make the DLL.

NOTE: The same error occurs for all Visual Basic project types.
