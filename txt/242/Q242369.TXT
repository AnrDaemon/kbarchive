The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0

SUMMARY
=======

This article outlines the basic steps to follow when building a distribution for
a SnapIn project developed with the MMC SnapIn Designer for Visual Basic using
the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW). There is an assumption that a SnapIn
project has already been developed and built properly. For more information on
how to build a SnapIn project, please refer to the "References" section below.

Steps To Package a SnapIn Project
---------------------------------

1. Start the Package and Deployment Wizard.

2. When the PDW loads, click Browse and locate the SnapIn project file on the
   system (VBP file).

3. When the proper project has been located, click Package.

4. The PDW presents the Package Type dialog box. For this example select the
   Standard Setup Package option and click Next .

5. The PDW presents the Package Folder dialog box. This option specifies where
   the finished package will reside. By default, the PDW creates a package
   folder under the project folder. In this example accept the default and click
   Next. The PDW prompts about creating a Folder that does not exist. This
   behavior is by design.

6. The PDW might display the following dialog box next:

   If this control will be used within a design environment other than Visual
   Basic, you will need to distribute the Property Page DLL. Do you want to
   include this file in your package?

   A SnapIn project is compiled as an .ocx file, and the PDW thinks the project
   is an ActiveX UserControl project. Select No to this question.

7. The PDW displays the Included Files dialog box. The Mssnaor.dll component
   should be included. If it is not, browse for the component and add it to the
   list. If there are additional files (readme file, etc) which need to be
   distributed this is where they are added to the package. Notice that the
   Msstkprp.dll should not be selected. When everything is set, click Next.

8. The PDW display the Cab Options dialog box. For this example, accept the
   default Single Cab option and click Next button.

9. The PDW displays the Installation Title dialog box. For this example, accept
   the default title and click Next.

10. The PDW displays the Start Menu Items dialog box. A SnapIn project should
   not add itself to the Start Menu unless there are additional files which
   ship (such as a readme file). When everything has been set, click Next.

11. The PDW displays the Install Location dialog box. The list shows where
   important components are installed on the target machine. Make sure that the
   Mssnapr.dll component is installed in the Program Files\Common
   Files\Microsoft Shared\SnapInDesigner folder. When everything is set, click
   Next.

12. The PDW displays the Shared Files dialog box. For this example simply click
   Next.

13. The PDW displays the Finished! dialog box. The option to save all the above
   taken options in a script file is presented. Click Finish and the PDW builds
   the distribution package.

Notes
-----

   1. A SnapIn developed with the MMC SnapIn Designer For Visual Basic requires
      the Visual Basic runtime files as well as the SnapIn runtime component
      (Mssnapr.dll). The PDW automatically includes these components in the
      distribution package.

   2. If the SnapIn project uses any ActiveX controls, confirm they are included
      with the distribution package. The PDW picks these dependencies up.

   3. The PDW does not pick up on implicit dependencies (late bound objects)
      which can cause problems when the SnapIn is executed on the target
      computer. For example, late binding to the File System Object, which is
      contained in the Scrrun.dll. The SnapIn project file (VBP) does not
      contain a reference to the component, and the Scripting Runtime is not
      included in the distribution package. If the Scripting Runtime is not
      installed on the target computer a 429 error occurs when the SnapIn tried
      to create the File System Object.
