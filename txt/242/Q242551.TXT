The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to run the SNA Server Setup program (Setup.exe) from the Microsoft
SNA Server Programs folder, or you attempt to uninstall SNA Server using
Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel, the following error message may occur:

   Install Path

   Setup has determined that your original install path no longer exists. If you
   are planning on adding additional components to your installation, please
   enter a path to a valid installation.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server 4.0 requires that the SNA Server 4.0 installation media be available
for the setup or uninstall to continue.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, make sure to do the following (depending on your type of
installation):

 - Insert the SNA Server 4.0 compact disc into the CD-ROM drive before you run
   Setup.exe or attempt to an uninstall.

 - When the SNA Server 4.0 compact disc is in the CD-ROM drive, type the
   original source installation path to the compact disc.

 - Type the path to the network share or local directory that contains the SNA
   Server Setup files.

In some cases, the error message will still appear even after the compact disc
has been inserted or the installation path has been entered. If this happens,
click the Ignore button for Setup to continue.
