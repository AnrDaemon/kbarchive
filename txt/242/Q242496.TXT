This hotfix contains the following changes to the Offer Summarizer:

 - Removes the six-second delay before processing a replication file.

 - Corrects a problem with the Replicate flag being set regardless of whether
   the record has been touched. This results in large replication files being
   generated all the time when they are not needed and flooding the central
   site.

 - Corrects a problem with the "dirty" bit unnecessarily being set on summary
   records, resulting in SQL/disk "churn" during normal operations.

This hotfix contains the following changes to the Site System Status Summarizer:

 - Removes the six-second delay before processing a replication file.
