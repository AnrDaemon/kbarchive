======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Visual Studio Installer is a new tool which you can use to make more
sophisticated setups than the Setup Wizard allows (in many cases). Visual Studio
Installer uses the new Windows Installer technology, which is geared towards
reducing total cost of ownership by allowing finer control over the setup
process and allowing applications to repair themselves.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Visual Studio Installer is available to registered users of Visual Studio or
its component parts at
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/downloads/vsi/default.asp. Installs are
created through the Visual Studio shell, which will feel familiar to users of
Visual Basic or Visual InterDev. Most of the components, though, will feel
familiar to Visual FoxPro users. For instance, the Properties window is almost
the same, and the Project Explorer is much like Visual FoxPro's Project
Manager.

The Visual Studio installer also allows finer control over the installation
process. You can add dialogs (such as Register User) and customize the
appearance of the various dialogs. For example, you can choose not to show a
copyright notice on the opening screen, or you can add a splash screen.

You will not want to use the Visual Studio Installer if your application requires
a post-setup executable. The Windows Installer setup process treats everything
as a transaction that can be rolled back if necessary. The post-setup executable
is outside the knowledge of Windows Installer; therefore, Windows Installer
cannot undo any changes the executable makes. For this reason, Visual Studio
Installer does not support the use of a post-setup executable. It also does not
support Microsoft Graph runtime installations. Visual Studio Installer does
support DCOM and remote automation use, but it requires adding keys to the
registry. The Visual FoxPro 6 Setup Wizard is more flexible in this case.
