PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA) may stop and record a
9405 event in the Windows NT Event Viewer. The 9405 event is from the Field
Engineering category:

   An unexpected error has occurred which may cause the MTA to terminate. Error:
   Bad secure on object 2589. [BASE XFER-IN 28] (16)


CAUSE
=====

Access to a connector such as the Internet Mail Service, located on the affected
server, is limited using distribution lists (DLs). Because of this restriction,
transferred messages have to be checked against this access limitation and the
DLs have to be expanded. Depending on the size and the nesting level of the DLs,
this may cause the error above.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

Pack 4.
