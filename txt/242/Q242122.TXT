TITLE   :Corrupted WINS database causes service to stop responding.
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS), the service may stop
responding (hang). You cannot restart the service, and Event IDs 4224 and 4318
may appear in Event Viewer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the WINS database is damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, back up the existing WINS database and its log files, and
then build a new WINS database:

1. Create a backup folder (for example, WINS_Old), and then move the current
   contents of the WINS folder to the new backup folder. WINS is located in the
   %SystemRoot%\System32\WINS\ folder.

2. Set WINS to start automatically:

   a. In Control Panel, double-click Services.

   b. In the Service list, click WINS, and then click Startup.

   c. Click Automatic, click OK, and then click Close.

   d. Close Control Panel.

3. Restart your computer. WINS automatically starts and builds a new WINS
   database.
