information in this article is provided as-is and is subject to change
without notice.

No formal product support is available from Microsoft for this Beta 
product. For information about obtaining support for a Beta release,

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the Microsoft Windows 2000 security is set to High and you try to install
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 on that system, you may get a notification
from the System File Protection (SFP) that a file replacement was attempted on
the protected system file Exstrace.dll.

You may also find the following event in the system event viewer:

   Event ID: 64000
   Source: SFC
   Description: File replacement was attempted on the protected system file
   exstrace.dll. This file was restored to the correct Microsoft version to
   maintain system stability.

STATUS
======

The version of Exstrace.dll that ships with Windows 2000 is backwards compatible
with Exchange Server 5.5, so this message is harmless. Windows 2000 System File
Protection replaces the file back to the Windows 2000 version.

Additional query words: emstrace.dll
