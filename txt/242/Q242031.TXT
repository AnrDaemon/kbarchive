STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Certificate Server, version
2.0.
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Changes made to Service Pack 6 include:

 - Certificate server had several work-arounds and special processing when the
   encoding length was 7f. This caused the installation to fail during
   installing a CA. This special processing is now disabled by default.

 - The Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is a list of revoked certificates that
   is digitally signed by the issuer of those certificates. Previously the
   certificates were not published by default; now the certificates are.

 - Error reporting was improved. New errors are not introduced, but error
   detection was increased to ensure messages are published when errors are
   encountered.

 - Certificate Server Setup has added the option for the administrator to
   control the keysize. This is done via a dropdown list with supported values
   (for example: 512, 1024, 2048, 4096). The default size is still 512.
