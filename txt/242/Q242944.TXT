TITLE   :XCON: MTA Generates a Large Number of Event ID 2125s
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The message transfer agent (MTA) may generate a large number of event ID 2125s
that are similar to the following, even though mail flow is not affected:

   Source: MSExchange MTA
   Type: Warning
   Category: Resource
   Event ID: 2125

   Description: Statistics for DBI call (DB Server) : file writes DISP:FANOUT,
   reads 11, cache hits 124, misses %5. Attribute %6, value number %7, Object
   ID: %8 (00000000 => N/A). Caller %12 [%9 %10 %11] (8)

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the MTA does not write to the .cfg files correctly when
the MTA processes new messages. This issue occurs most often when one of the
Info*.cfg files is an incorrect version or is corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use one of the following procedures, as applicable:

 - If the object ID is referenced in the event ID description as shown in the
   following example

   Event ID: 2125
   Type: Information
   Category: Field Engineering
   Description: Statistics for DBI call (19): file writes 0, read 0, cache hits
   1, misses 1. Attribute 84, value number 3, Object ID: 0600003A (00000000
   => N/A). Caller 117 (DB Server DISP:ROUTER 11)(8)

   perform the following steps:

   1. Note the object ID that is included in event 2125 (0600003A in this
      example).

   2. Remove the .dat file that has a file name that is composed of the last six
      digits of the object ID from the Mtadata folder (the Db00003a.dat file in
      this example).

   3. Run the following command:

   <exchsrvr>\BIN\mtacheck

   4. Restart the MTA.

   5. Reapply the relevant Exchange Server service packs and any post-service
      pack fixes.

 - If no object ID is included in the event ID description, apply the latest
   Exchange Server service pack, so that all of the files are the correct
   version.
