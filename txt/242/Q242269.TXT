SYMPTOMS
========

Moderators don't receive new items from some users when posted to a moderated
public folder.

CAUSE
=====

The sensitivity of the new items is set to Private. When users post items to a
moderated public folder, the new items will be forwarded to moderators for
review. Since items marked Private can not be forwarded, moderators do not
receive the posted items, but users still receive a response.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the posted items' sensitivity to Normal.

MORE INFORMATION
================

<Exchange Server Name>/Diagnostic Logging/MSExchangeIS/Public, the
following event is logged:

Event ID: 1066
Source: MSExchangeIS Public
Category: Rules
Description:
Action 0 in rule ID # was canceled. The forward rule will not be triggered on
messages with Sensitivity set to Private.
