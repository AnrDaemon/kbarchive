OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 98 Deployment Kit 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you deploy Outlook 98 by using the Outlook Deployment Kit (ODK), you may
get the following error message:

   There is not enough disk space to complete installation. You can change your
   installation options, continue installation, or exit Setup.

This error occurs even though there is plenty of free disk space on the drive on
which you are installing Outlook 98.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if the drive to which you are installing Outlook 98
contains more than 4 gigabytes (GB) of free space and you have an earlier
version of the Jobexec.dll file, possibly from Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

Rename the Jobexec.dll file (located in the Winnt\System32 or Windows\System
folder) on the target computer, and run the ODK Setup again.
