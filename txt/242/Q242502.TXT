SYMPTOMS
========

After you add or remove a trusted domain, the domain logon list in the logon
dialog box on a computer that is a member of the trusting domain may not reflect
the change.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can be caused by either of the following conditions:

 - Setting the date of the member computer to a previous date.

 - Setting the date to a future date and logging off and on or locking the
   computer, and then setting the date back to the current date.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
To resolve this issue, use Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) to delete the DCache
and DCacheUpdate values in the following registry key and then restart your
computer:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon
