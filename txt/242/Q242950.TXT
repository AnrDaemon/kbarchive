SYMPTOMS
========

When you use migration dynamic link library (.dll) files and custom Migrate.inf
files to upgrade your Windows 98/95-based computer to Windows 2000, some
registry entries may not be migrated to the Windows 2000 registry.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the registry settings in the [HANDLED] section of the
Migrate.inf file have an identifier type of "Registry".

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, edit the appropriate Migrate.inf file and set the
appropriate registry entry identifier types to "Report".

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 2000 Migration DLLs use the [HANDLED] section of a Migrate.inf file to
specify files and registry entries that the migration .dll file will migrate
during Windows 2000 Setup. When registry entries are placed in the [HANDLED]
section of the Migrate.inf file, the associated key and all sub-keys are removed
from the registry after the upgrade to Windows 2000 finishes.

The [HANDLED] section of the Migrate.inf file behaves differently when working
with registry entries and files. When a file is specified, Setup does not move
that file or generate any incompatibility error messages. The file is not
deleted. However, any registry entries specified in the [HANDLED] section of the
Migrate.inf file whose identifier type is set to "Registry" are not copied to
the Windows 2000 registry.

For example, view the following [HANDLED] section of a Migrate.inf file:

[HANDLED]
"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\MyCompany\Win95Specific"=Registry
"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\MyCompany\Common"=Report

In this example, the Win95Specific registry key will not be migrated to the new
Windows 2000 registry because the identifier type is "Registry". However, the
Common registry key is copied into the new registry because the identifier type
is "Report".
