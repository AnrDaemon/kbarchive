SUMMARY
=======

A user who creates a new profile has permission to use that profile, but someone
with administrator permissions can permit other users to also use the profile.
This article describes how to copy a profile to another domain and assign a user
permission to use the copied profile. Note that permissions written to a profile
are stored in the NTuser.xxx file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To copy a profile to another domain and assign a user permission to use the
profile:

1. In Control Panel, double-click System.

2. Click the User Profiles tab, click the profile, and then click Copy To.

3. Type the path to the folder where user profiles are stored, or click Browse
   to locate the folder.

   NOTE: The dialog box that appears when you click Browse does not permit you to
   create folders. You must create the required folder before you copy the
   profile.

4. Click Change.

5. In the List Names From box, click the name of the other domain.

6. In the Names box for the other domain, select the user account of the person
   who is permitted to use the profile.

7. Click OK until all open dialog boxes are closed.
