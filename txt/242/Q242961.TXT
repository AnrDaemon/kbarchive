TITLE   :Exchange Server DNS Error Messages When Using Dial-Up Networking
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use a Dial-Up Networking connection to connect to a computer running
Exchange Server with DNS enabled, you may receive time-out error messages or a
Non-Delivery Report (NDR).

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the "use DNS" feature located on the Connections
tab of the Exchange Administrator Internet Mail Service properties is designed
to work with full-time Internet connections.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the "Forward all messages to host" feature and
specify an ISP relay server.

This allows faster connections since e-mail is forwarded to a closer server and
the Internet service provider (ISP) e-mail server is able to handle DNS queries
that the Exchange server needs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Small Business Server Internet Connection Wizard does not allow this
configuration. You can change the "use DNS" feature after you complete the
Internet Connection Wizard.
