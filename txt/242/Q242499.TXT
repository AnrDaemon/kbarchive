The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you attempt to install the Microsoft ADO for Windows CE SDK (ADOCE) onto a
machine where Windows CE Services has not been installed, you receive the
following error message:

   Setup could not find Windows CE Services 2.0 installed on your system. Please
   install Windows CE Services before installing this application.

This occurs even if ActiveSync 3.0, the upgrade to Windows CE Service 2.x, has
been previously installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can override this behavior as long as ActiveSync 3.0 is installed. To work
around this problem, open the ADOCE.STF file using Notepad.exe or a similar
text-only editor, and change the following line:

2 Windows CE Services 2.0 CustomAction "adosetup.dll,
AddAppSrch,""Required,C:\,ceappmgr.exe,2.0,3 4"""

to:

2 Windows CE Services 2.0 CustomAction "adosetup.dll,
AddAppSrch,""Required,C:\,ceappmgr.exe,3.0,3 4"""
