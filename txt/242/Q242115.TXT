======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use your Microsoft Windows NT 4.0-based computer locally, it may
respond slowly. For example, Windows NT Explorer, Control Panel, Network
Neighborhood, and so on, may take several minutes to start. However, your
computer may respond normally over a remote connection.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) service is not
running.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, set the RPC service to Automatic, and then start the
service:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Services.

2. In the Service box, click Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Service, and then click
   Startup.

3. Click Automatic, and then click OK.

4. Click Start.

5. Click Close to close the Services dialog box.
