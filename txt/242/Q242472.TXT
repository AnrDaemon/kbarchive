SYMPTOMS
========

If the Performance Monitor extensible counter dynamic-link library (DLL) path in
the registry contains more than 62 characters, you receive an "Access violation"
error message in Performance Monitor (Perfmon.exe) when you click Add Counters
in any chart, log, or report.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the Performance Monitor extensible counter DLL path in
the registry, which is a long string of more than 62 characters, gets
concatenated in the small size buffer. This causes a buffer overflow.
