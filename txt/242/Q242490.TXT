SYMPTOMS
========

If you distribute multiple packages using a common share and then attempt to
issue a removal for any of the packages, Distribution Manager (DistMgr) removes
the package successfully but does not succeed when it attempts to delete the
common share. This behavior occurs because the share is not empty. The following
error is logged in the Distmgr.log file:

   The package share directory <path> is not empty, cannot remove the
   share <name>.

DistMgr attempts the share removal process a number of times.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article

package share, or specify unique share names for each package.
