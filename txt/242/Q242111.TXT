SYMPTOMS
========

When you install a new CD-ROM drive on a computer running Microsoft Windows NT,
the computer may not recognize the CD-ROM drive.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you installed the wrong CD-ROM driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, install the correct CD-ROM driver for your CD-ROM drive.
To do this, follow these steps:

NOTE: To identify the correct CD-ROM driver, you need to know the manufacturer
and model of your CD-ROM drive. However, for some models, you can use a generic
mass-storage controller driver to run the CD-ROM drive.

1. In Control Panel, double-click SCSI Adapters.

2. Click the Devices tab.

3. In the list of SCSI adapters and connected devices, click the CD-ROM drive.

4. On the Drivers tab, click Add.

5. In the Manufacturers list, click the manufacturer of the CD-ROM drive.

6. In the SCSI Adapter list, click the adapter name, and then do one of the
   following:

   a. If you have a driver disk from the manufacturer, click Have Disk, and then
      follow the instructions for completing the installation.

   b. If you do not have a driver disk from the manufacturer, click OK, and then
      continue to install the driver.

7. When you complete the installation, restart the computer.
