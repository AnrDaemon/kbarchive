TITLE   :XADM: Installing Internet Explorer 4.0 After Exchange Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you need to run Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 and Exchange Server on the
same computer, install Internet Explorer 4.0 before you install Exchange Server.
If you install Internet Explorer 4.0 after you install Exchange Server, Internet
Explorer modifies the MIME registry database, which causes problems for
international mail, especially mail with double-byte character set (DBCS)
content. If you have installed Internet Explorer 4.0 after installing Exchange
Server, complete the procedure in the "More Information" section to correct this
problem. You can perform the procedure without stopping any Exchange Server
services.

NOTE: This procedure is not required if you are installing Internet Explorer 4.0
before you install Exchange Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Copy the Reset.inf file in the Server\Support\Mimedb folder from the Exchange
Server compact disc to a local hard disk. Right-click on the file, and click
Install.
