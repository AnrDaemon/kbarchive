KEYWORDS:kbCompiler kbCPPonly kbLangCPP kbVC kbVC500 kbVC500bug kbVC600 kbVC600bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Argument-dependent name lookup, also known as Koenig lookup, works only for
operators and not regular functions in a namespace.

CAUSE
=====

The compiler does not fully support argument-dependent name lookup as specified
in the C++ Standard. Please refer to the C++ Standard, section 3.4.2, for
information on argument-dependent name lookup.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior:

The following code example demonstrates the error:

   //test.cpp
   // compiler option needed:/GX  
   #include <iostream>
   namespace N1 {
   	struct T1 {
   	};
   	void g(T1) {
   	}
    	T1 operator+( T1 x, T1 y) {
   		std::cout<< "In N1::+" <<std::endl;
   		return y;
   	}
   }

   int main() {
   	N1::T1 t1 ,t2;
   	g(t1);	// error C2065: 'g' : undeclared identifier
   	t1 + t2; // works fine calls N1::operator+
   	return 0;
   }
