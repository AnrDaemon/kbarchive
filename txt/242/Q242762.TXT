   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

You may be in a situation where you need to remove Exchange Server and reinstall
it. After you reinstall Exchange Server, you try to reinstall the Exchange Notes
Connector. After the Setup program copies all the files and tries to create the
Connectivity Controller service, the installation does not work, and a message
appears indicating that the service is already installed.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Server 5.5 Setup program is not aware of the Connectivity
Controller and its connector services. When you click the Remove All option in
the Exchange Server 5.5 Setup program, the Connectivity Controller and connector
services are not removed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, you must manually remove the Connectivity Controller
and Connector services. This involves deleting the corresponding registry
entries and support files.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start the Windows NT Registry Editor.

2. At the following subkey, delete the entire MSExchangeCoCo key:

   \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeCoCo

At the following subkey, delete the entire LME-NOTES key:

   \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LME-NOTES

3. Move or delete the Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn folder.

4. Shut down all Exchange Server services and reboot the server.

5. Install the Connector for Lotus Notes.
