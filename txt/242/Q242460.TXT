TITLE   :Performance Issues with FPNW Installed on Terminal Server as PDC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) in Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition, Service Pack 4 (SP4) as a primary domain
controller (PDC), there may be performance issues in Terminal Server. The
performance issues do not occur if you install FPNW on Terminal Server as a
member server.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, install FPNW in Terminal Server as a member
server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you install FPNW in Terminal Server SP4 as a PDC, it may take a long time
after you press CTRL+ALT+DELETE for the dialog box to appear. After that,
everything seems to take longer than if Terminal Server is installed as a member
server.

Additional query words: wts tse slow slower
