SYMPTOMS
========

Creating a file on a NetWare server with Read/Write access may return a handle
to a read-only file. The caller is unaware that the file is read-only because
GENERIC_READ and GENERIC_WRITE were specified in the CreateFile call.

CAUSE
=====

When CreateFile is called, a read-only file can be opened even thought the
GENERIC_READ and GENERIC_WRITE flags were specified by the caller. The problem
occurs when you create a file with a long file name on a NetWare server by using
Nwredir. The problem occurs in the bindery client as well as Services for
NetWare Directory Services.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you call CreateFile(..., GENERIC_READ, ...), this issue is likely to occur.
If it succeeds, you can then close the returned handle and call CreateFile(...,
GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE, ...) as normal.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
