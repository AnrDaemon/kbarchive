SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to create or add a printer port remotely, you cannot do so.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because you cannot create or add a printer port remotely by
using Microsoft Windows NT 4.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, use a third-party utility, such as Hewlett-Packard
(HP) JetAdmin, or write a utility by using the AddPort Application Programming
Interface (API), which can be found in the Microsoft Win32 Software Development
Kit (SDK).

NOTE: JetDirect is no longer supported by HP. SDI (Simple Device Installation) is
now used to install network printers. For more information on this, see:

   or

HP recommends a new software admin package (TCP/IP / IPX/SPX Based). For further
