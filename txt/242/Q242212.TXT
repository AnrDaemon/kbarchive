SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Server Mailbox Manager allows you to select mailboxes
that you want to exclude from automated message deletion. With MBClean, there
was a limit to the number of mailboxes that could be excluded. This limitation
was caused by the way in which the mailbox exclusion information was being
stored. To overcome this limitation, Mailbox Manager stores the exclusion
information on the mailbox itself. Mailbox Manager uses a custom proxy address
of type MBX and adds this proxy address to each mailbox that is excluded. For
example, if you use Mailbox Manager to exclude a mailbox named "Test," a proxy
address of type MBX is added to the Test mailbox. When Mailbox Manager processes
the mailboxes for cleanup, it ignores the mailboxes that have the proxy address
MBX.
