MORE INFORMATION
================

CD-ROM: Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 Is Not Included
-----------------------------------------------------

The autorun screen for the SQL Server 7.0 Evaluation CD states that Windows NT
4.0 SP4 is included on a second CD.

There is only one CD included. Please see the System Requirements on the last
page of the book:

"Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 is not included on the companion CD. You can
download this Service Pack from the Internet at
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/."


Page iv: ?Determining? Not In Title Of Chapter 32
-------------------------------------------------

On page iv of the Contents At A Glance, Chapter 32 is titled Determining Common
Performance Problems. However, the actual chapter, starting on page 798, is
titled Common Performance Problems.


Page iv: The Title Of Appendix C Is Incorrect
---------------------------------------------

On page iv, in the Appendix C title, change:
"SQL Server Configuration Options"

To:
"DBCC Commands"


Page 96: Formula To Determine Total CPU Write Time Is Incorrect
---------------------------------------------------------------

On page 96, in step 8, the formula for determining the total CPU write time is
incorrect.

Change:
CPU write time = (writes/sec) * (CPU write time)

To:
total CPU write time = (writes/sec) * (CPU time for a single write) * (work
period)


Page 734: Incorrect Information About Differential Backup
---------------------------------------------------------

On page 734, under Restoring from a Differential Backup, change:
"To restore from a differential backup, you must first restore from a full backup
and then restore all of the differential backups that have been created since
the last full backup. Remember, a differential backup is used to back up
information that has changed since the last full or differential backup."

To:
"To restore from a differential backup, you must first restore from a full backup
and then restore the last differential backup. Remember, a differential backup
is used to back up information that has changed since the last full backup."


Page 821: The First Page Of Appendix A Is 822, Not 823
------------------------------------------------------

On page 821 (Part VI opener), in Appendix A change:
"SQL Server Configuration Options 823"

To:
"SQL Server Configuration Options 822"
