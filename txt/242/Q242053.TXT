TITLE   :Event ID 4319: Duplicate names on the network.
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the computer, the NetBIOS name resolution over your Transmission
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)-based network may not succeed, and
Event Viewer may report Event ID 4319 with the following error message:

   A duplicate name has been detected on the TCP network.
   The IP address of the machine that sent the message is in the data.
   Use nbtstat -n in a command window to check which name is in the conflict
   state.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if there are incorrect static mappings in the Windows
Internet Name Service (WINS) database, or if a multihomed WINS server has the
WINS Client (TCP/IP) bound to both network adapters.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, delete the static WINS mappings and clean (scavenge) the
WINS database. If the server is a multihomed WINS server, disable the WINS
client on one of the network adapters.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Delete the static mappings:

   a. Start WINS Manager.

   b. On the Mappings menu, click Static Mappings.

   c. In the Static Mappings dialog box, click WINS Static Mapping, and then
      click Delete Mapping.

   d. Click Close.

2. Clean the WINS database:

   a. In the WINS Manager window, click Mappings, and then click Initiate
      Scavenging.

   b. To confirm the queuing of the scavenging command, click OK.

3. Disable the WINS client:

   a. In Control Panel, double-click Network.

   b. Click the Bindings tab.

   c. In the Show Bindings For list, click All Adapters.

   d. Click the plus character (+) next to the appropriate adapter name.

   e. Right-click WINS Client (TCP/IP), and then click Disable.

   f. In the Network dialog box, click OK.

   g. Click Yes to restart the computer.
