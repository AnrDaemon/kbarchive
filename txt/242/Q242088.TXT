TITLE   :Winnt /b Doesn't Work on WinNT 4.0 w/ Onboard Adaptec 7895 SCSI
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing Microsoft Windows NT with the 'WINNT /B' command, the
computer may stop responding (hang), or you may receive a STOP 0x0000007b error
message.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if Microsoft's generic Aic78xx.sys driver is used
instead of an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) driver. On any Windows NT
4.0-based computer using the Adaptec 7895 or 7890 SCSI (Dual) controller, the
OEM driver must be used. This includes Windows NT-based computers dedicated to
Microsoft Small Business Server or Terminal Server. Some Gateway and IBM
computers use this chip set, and it is becoming more popular on 'clone'
computers as well.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, download and install the 7800wnt.exe file from Adaptec:

1. Visit the following Adaptec Web site and download the 7800wnt.exe file by
   copying and pasting the following URL into the Address line of your Web
   browser:

http://www.adaptec.com/worldwide/support/suppdetail.html?cat=/Product/AHA-2940&prodkey=AHA-2940

2. Once the 7800wnt.exe file is downloaded, double-click it to install the files
   it contains.

NOTE: On Dell computers, a proprietary version of the Adaptec chip set is used.
Obtain the correct files from the Dell file library at the following Dell Web
site:
