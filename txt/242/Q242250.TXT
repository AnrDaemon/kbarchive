KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Exchange Server connectors use the Microsoft Exchange Connectivity Controller.
When you run the standard Update.exe program to update the Exchange Server
computer, the Exchange Connectivity Controller requires a separate service pack
installation. You can perform the Exchange Connectivity Controller service pack
installation by running another executable in the folder for that specific
connector.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To apply the service pack for the following Exchange Server connectors

 - Microsoft Exchange Calendar Connector

 - Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes

 - Microsoft Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise

 - Microsoft Exchange Connector for IBM OfficeVision/VM (PROFS) (also known as
   Microsoft Exchange Connector for IBM OV/VM)

 - Microsoft Exchange Connector for SNADS

from the root of the CD-ROM, run the executable files that are located in the
following folder

   Eng\Exchconn\Setup\<platform>

where <platform> is either the I386 processor platform for computers with
Intel processors or the Alpha processor platform for computers with Digital
Equipment Corporation (DEC) or Compaq Alpha processors.

The following table describes which subfolder corresponds to the appropriate
connector service pack setup.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Folder  | Connector                                                    | 
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Calcon  | Microsoft Exchange Calendar Connector                        | 
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Ntsconn | Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes                 | 
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Gwxconn | Microsoft Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise            | 
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Ovvconn | Microsoft Exchange Connector for IBM OfficeVision/VM (PROFS) | 
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Snaconn | Microsoft Exchange Connector for SNADS                       | 
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

To apply the service pack, run the executable file in the appropriate folder.

For example, for the Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes you need to run the
Ntsconn.exe executable file that is located in the
SPCD\Eng\Exchconn\Setup\I386\Ntsconn folder.
