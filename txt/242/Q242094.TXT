KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start Server Manager or User Manager for Domains on the primary
domain controller (PDC), you may receive the following error message:

   Unable to find primary domain controller for this domain.

When this occurs, no other computer can ping the PDC by address. The IPCONFIG
command shows no IP address bound to the network adapter. Bindings show IP and
NWlink bound to the network adapter, but you have no network functionality.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the IP address appears not to be bound to the
network adapter.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, remove and reinstall the network adapter, or replace the
network adapter with another.
