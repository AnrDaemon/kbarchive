This hotfix contains the following changes to the Component Summarizer:

 - Removes the six-second delay before processing a replication file.

 - Changes the default replication interval for the Component Summarizer from
   five minutes to ten minutes.

 - Changes the Component Summarizer so that it explicitly does not replicate
   even after the default ten-minute timer has expired if the only incoming
   status messages have to do with any Summarizer replication actions. Any other
   incoming messages cause replication to occur after the replication timer has
   expired.

   This replication timer is configurable in the Site Control file. To set the
   timer for every 15 minutes, use the following line:

   PROPERTY <Replication Interval><><><900>

NOTE: This is configurable for every summarizer, but the defaults for Offer and
Site System are still five minutes.
