TITLE   :Err Msg: You Already Have a Connection to the Domain
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to join a workstation to a domain, the following error message
may appear:

   You already have a connection to the domain. You must disconnect before
   joining the domain.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if a persistent connection already exists between the
workstation and the primary domain controller (PDC). A persistent connection
between a workstation that does not belong to the domain and the domain
controller itself is possible if you connect to a share by using a
domain-authenticated user account and password.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, delete all connections to the domain by using the NET USE
command at a command prompt, or use the Disconnect network drive command in
Windows NT Explorer, and then join the domain by using the Network dialog box.

The following are the specific steps:

1. To disconnect from all network drives, type the following line at a command
   prompt, and then press ENTER:

   NET USE * /DELETE

   This command lists all the connections, and then prompts for whether the
   connections should be broken.

2. To join the domain, at the workstation to be added to the domain,
   double-click the Network icon in Control Panel, and then click Change.

   NOTE: You must be a domain administrator to add the workstation to the domain.

3. Click Domain, and then type the appropriate domain name.

4. Click OK, and then click OK.
