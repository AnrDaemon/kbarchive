If you use the Visual Basic Data Form Wizard to open an Access 2000 database you

recognize the Access 2000 database format.

RESOLUTION

Open the Access 2000 database through an ODBC DSN using the Access ODBC driver
version 4.0.

-- Or --

Build your form manually using either the Jet OLEDB version 4.0 provider or an
ODBC DSN through the Access ODBC driver version 4.0

STATUS

This problem has been fixed in Service Pack 4 for Visual Basic.
