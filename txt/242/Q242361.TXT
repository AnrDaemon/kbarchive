   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive one of the following error messages:

   RPC Server Is Unavailable
   RPC Too Busy

When this occurs, connectivity to the server stops. Rebooting the server clears
the message and restores connectivity temporarily.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you have run the C2 Configuration Manager utility
from the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit. The C2 Configuration Manager
utility makes changes to the server that disable network functionality if an
auditable event cannot be logged.

The C2 Configuration Manager utility makes two changes to the server that stop
networking functionality if auditable events cannot be logged. The first change
is the addition of the following registry key:

   Key: \CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa
   Value: CrashOnAuditFail
   Type: REG_DWORD
   Data Value: 1

This key prevents auditable activities when the Security log becomes full.

The second change is the setting for the log files in Event Viewer. The Log File
Wrapping setting is changed to Do Not Overwrite Events (Clear Log Manually).

With these two settings in place, the server shuts down all auditable processes
(causing Remote Procedure Call, or RPC, to stop working) when the Security event
log becomes full.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use either of the following methods to work around this problem:

Method 1: Remove the CrashOnAuditFail Value
-------------------------------------------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Use Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) to delete the CrashOnAuditFail value from the
following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\

After you make this change, quit Registry Editor and restart the computer to
cause the change to take effect.

Method 2: Change the Event Log Settings
---------------------------------------

1. Start Event Viewer.

2. On the Log menu, click Log Settings.

3. In the Settings dialog box, you can either increase the size of the Security
   log, or change the Log File Wrapping setting to "Overwrite events as needed".
