OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCRT kbVC kbVC600 kbVC600bug kbDSupport

The information in this article applies to:

 - The C Run-Time (CRT), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The C run-time (CRT) function uncaught_exception should return true if an
exception is being processed. However, the function always returns false.

CAUSE
=====

The uncaught_exception function is not correctly implemented as specified in the
C++ Standard (section 18.6.4). The function is implemented as a stub function,
which always returns false. Please refer to the Uncaught.cpp file shipped with
the CRT source.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
