The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

By default, the Microsoft Exchange Server Internet Mail Connector (Exchange
Server 4.0) or Internet Mail Service (Exchange Server 5.0 and 5.5) route mail
addressed to the postmaster account of the default site SMTP domain. The site
SMTP domain is specified on the Site Addressing tab of the site Addressing
object. This mail is routed to the account set as the administrator of the
Internet Mail Service or Internet Mail Connector. This is set on the Internet
Mail tab of the Internet Mail Service or Internet Mail Connector object.

On Exchange Server computers hosting multiple SMTP domains, this postmaster
address does not work for all of them. In order to accept mail for the
postmaster account of the other hosted SMTP domains, the SMTP address needs to
be added as a secondary address for a recipient on the Exchange Server
computer.

Before adding the postmaster address to one of your users, you need to determine
which user should receive this mail. The postmaster address is generally used to
report problems with Internet mail, be it a report about a spam source from that
domain, or a request for help dealing with a non-delivery report (NDR) to that
domain.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To add a secondary SMTP address to a user:

1. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program.

2. Select the Global Address List container.

3. Open the properties of the mailbox to which you want to add an SMTP address.

4. On the E-Mail Address tab, click New, click Internet Address, and then click
   OK.

5. Add the postmaster address for the domain you want, and click OK.

6. Click OK to close the mailbox properties.
