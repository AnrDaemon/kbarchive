TITLE   :XFOR: Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise Event 6067
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise (Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 3 or Web 4 version) attempts to access a file that is
locked, the Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise logs an event 6067 error in
the application event log.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Server computer attempts to open the file every 200 milliseconds,
but the file is locked by the NetWare server, which returns a File Lock Fail
packet to the Exchange Server computer. The NetWare server locks the file
because it is still writing to the file. During this time, the Exchange Server
computer logs the error in the Microsoft Windows NT Event Viewer. Eventually,
the Exchange Server computer is able to open the file and does a burst read of
it.

RESOLUTION
==========

Even though this error is logged, the Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise
still works. Ignore the error unless another process (for example, a virus scan,
backup agent, or another connector) may be holding the file. This problem is
common during the transfer of directory synchronization files, but may also
occur with calendar information, as well as with large attachments.
