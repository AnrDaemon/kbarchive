SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to implement system policies on Microsoft Windows
95-based client computers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To implement system policies on a Windows 95-based client computer, create a
policy file in Windows 95, and then configure Windows 95 to use personal
settings.

NOTE: If you already have a policy file, make sure that its file name is
Config.pol and the file is located in the Netlogon folder of either the primary
domain controller or the backup domain controller.

To create a policy file in Windows 95:

1. Start System Policy Editor.

2. On the File menu, click New File.

3. Set policy options:

   a. Double-click Default Computer, select the computer policy options, and
      then click OK.

   b. Double-click Default User, select the user policy options, and then click
      OK.

4. Save the policy file:

   a. On the File menu, click Exit.

   b. To save the changes, click Yes.

   c. Save the file as Config.pol in the Netlogon folder of either the primary
      domain controller or the backup domain controller. The Netlogon folder is
      located in the following folder:

   C:\Winnt\System32\Repl\Import\Scripts

To configure Windows 95 to use personal settings after you create the policy
file:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Passwords.

2. Click the Users Profiles tab.

3. Click "Users Can Customize Their Preferences And Desktop Settings. Windows
   Switches To Your Personal Settings Whenever You Log In", and then click OK.

4. Click Close, and then restart the computer.
