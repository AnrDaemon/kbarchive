TITLE   :Keyboard intermittently stops responding on Compaq computers.
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On Compaq keyboards connected to computers running Microsoft Windows NT or
Microsoft Windows 95, the light-emitting diode (LED) lights may intermittently
turn on and off unexpectedly, and eventually the keyboard may stop responding
(hang).

CAUSE
=====

Static electricity may have caused the keyboard to hang or behave in unexpected
ways. Your work environment may contribute to static buildup, which you can
conduct to the keyboard.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this issue from occurring, protect the computer from static
electricity.

Compaq has indicated that the newest keyboard models may not encounter this
problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Electrostatic discharge (ESD), more commonly known as static electricity, can
destroy electronic equipment immediately or cause hardware failure.

Environmental conditions and methods of handling equipment determine whether ESD
is a problem. Humidity reduces ESD risk because static electricity is carried
away by water molecules; dry air is a poor conductor and increases the risk of
ESD. Clothing, footwear, and flooring materials are important considerations
when you evaluate the potential for ESD.

The circuits within a computer's components are particularly sensitive to
electrostatic discharge damage.

When you install any new piece of computer equipment, work on a tile floor rather
than on carpeting. Remove your shoes if possible, and roll up your shirt
sleeves. If you set the component down, do not let the component touch the table
before your hand touches the table.

To minimize ESD problems, consider wearing a wrist strap when you are working on
computer components. A wrist strap is a simple length of wire with a
watchband-style strap at one end and a plug or clip on the other end. The plug
or clip is connected to a common ground or to the piece of equipment being
worked on. Sometimes a technician clips a connector (two alligator clips on a
wire) between the watchband and the component.
