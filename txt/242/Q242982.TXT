======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Issuing the APPEND FROM <xlfile.xls> TYPE XL8 command makes Visual FoxPro
either disappear or produce an error. In Visual FoxPro 6.0 running under Windows
NT 4.0, the following error message might appear before the application closes:

   Fatal error: Exception code=C0000005

After selecting OK, Visual FoxPro disappears. In Visual FoxPro 6.0 Service Pack 3
running under Windows NT 4.0, FoxPro simply disappears after executing the
APPEND FROM command. No error message appears.

In Visual FoxPro 6.0 Service Pack 3 running under Windows 98, the following error
appears:

   Microsoft Excel file format is invalid.


RESOLUTION
==========

1. Open the Network Applet in the Windows Control Panel.

2. Select the Novell NetWare Client from the network components and click the
   Properties button.

3. Select the Advanced Settings tab of the Novell NetWare Client Properties
   dialog.

4. Select the "Use Extended File Handles" property.

5. Change the "Setting" value to "ON."

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Novell NetWare Client for Windows 95 release 3.0 and greater, has a new Use
Extended File Handles property that has been added to the Advanced Settings. The
default setting for Use Extended File Handles is "OFF."

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Launch Visual FoxPro and set the default directory to a directory on a Novell
   Netware Server.

2. Create a program file named "DEMO.PRG" with the following code:

   CLOSE ALL
   SET SAFETY OFF
   IF !FILE("base.dbf")
      CREATE TABLE BASE (basekey c(10), memofld m)
      INSERT INTO BASE (basekey,memofld) VALUES ("0000001","this is ;
      a test")
      INDEX ON basekey TAG basekey OF BASE
   ENDIF
   FOR i=1 TO 100
      thisstr="file"+ALLTRIM(STR(i))
      SELECT DISTINCT * FROM BASE INTO TABLE &thisstr
      SELECT (thisstr)
      INDEX ON basekey TAG basekey OF &thisstr
   NEXT
   SET SAFETY ON

3. Run the DEMO.PRG file.

4. When the following error message appears, click Cancel:

   Too many files open

5. From the Command window, type "DIR" (without the quotation marks). The
   machine may hang at this point.
