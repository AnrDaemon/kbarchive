TITLE   :GSNW Shares Deleted with NT Server Connected to Cisco Catalyst 5
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start a computer running Microsoft Windows NT Server that is connected
to a Cisco Catalyst 5000 Etherswitch, file shares using Gateway Services for
NetWare (GSNW) may be disconnected.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the port is slow initializing.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, contact Cisco to enable the Portfast option on the Cisco
Catalyst 5000 Etherswitch.

Stop the GSNW service after restarting the server but before changing the
portfast setting on the switch. Restart the GSNW and Server services. If the
shares appear correctly, slow port initialization is causing the problem. Set
portfast enabled on the Cisco switch.
