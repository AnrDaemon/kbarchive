======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When creating a setup for a Windows CE Toolkit for a Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0
(VBCE) application targeting Palm-size PCs, the install wizard does not include
ADOCE 2.0 in the setup; this results in errors after the installation. This
article discusses the steps necessary to ensure that the application is
successfully installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To resolve this problem, the distribution package can be manually changed to
include the ADOCE 2.0 support files. The steps below make the assumption that
the VBCE project has already been created and compiled to a .vb file.

Step by Step Example
--------------------

1. Create the installation package using the Application Install Wizard.

2. Copy the necessary support files for ADOCE 2.0 from each of the processor
   specific directories. For example, copy the files from "Windows CE
   Tools\wce211\ms palm size pc\adoce\mips39" to "package path\Mips 3000 (4K)
   v2.11."

3. Modify the INF file as follows to include the ADOCE 2.0 support files. (The
   INF file for Project1 would be Project1.inf.) Change all the processor
   specific sections for CESelfRegister, SourceDisksFiles, and the Source list
   at the end of the file. The following is an example of the Mips3x section:

[DefaultInstall.Mips 3000 (4K) v2.11]
CopyFiles=Files.Mips 3000 (4K) v2.11
CESelfRegister=vbscript.dll,pvbhost2.dll,pvbform2.dll, adoce.dll, 
adocedb.dll, adocereg.dll, adoceres.dll, adosync.dll

[CEDevice.Mips 3000 (4K) v2.11]
ProcessorType=4000

[SourceDisksNames.Mips 3000 (4K) v2.11]
3= ,"Mips 3000 (4K) v2.11 Files",,Mips 3000 (4K) v2.11

[SourceDisksFiles.Mips 3000 (4K) v2.11]
pvbhost2.dll=3
pvbload.exe=3
vbscript.dll=3
vbsen.dll=3
pvbform2.dll=3
adoce.dll=3 
adocedb.dll=3
adocereg.dll=3
adoceres.dll=3
adosync.dll=3

[Files.Mips 3000 (4K) v2.11]
pvbhost2.dll,,0x80000000
pvbload.exe
vbscript.dll,,0x80000000
vbsen.dll
pvbform2.dll,,0x80000000
adoce.dll 
adocedb.dll
adocereg.dll
adoceres.dll
adosync.dll

4. Repackage the .cab files using cabwiz.exe as described in the readme.txt file
   in the package directory.

5. Copy the resulting .cab files to the CD1 directory.

6. Test the setup.

The CD1 directory now contains a distribution including the required ADOCE 2.0
file.
