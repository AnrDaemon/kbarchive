SUMMARY

This article describes how to move your saved Age of Empires II: The Age of
Kings games, campaigns, and scenarios to a different computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To move your saved Age of Empires II games, campaigns, and scenarios to a
different computer:

1. On the original computer, use Microsoft Backup or a similar program to make a
   backup of the following files

   drive:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires II\SaveGame\*.*

   drive:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires II\Campaign\*.*

   drive:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires II\Scenario\*.*

   drive:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires II\Player.nfo

   where drive is the drive letter of the hard disk on which Age of Empires II is
   installed.

   NOTE: "*.*" represents all files located in the folder.

2. Install Age of Empires II on a different computer.

   NOTE: If Age of Empires II is already installed on the other computer, you may
   want to rename the Player.nfo file on the other computer to preserve the
   player name and campaign progress it contains.

3. If Age of Empires II Expansion is installed on the original computer, install
   it on the computer onto which you want to move the saved games.

4. On the computer onto which you want to move the saved games, campaigns, and
   scenarios, restore the files you backed up in step 1 to the appropriate
   folders.
