TITLE   :Subordinate Certificates Appear Invalid with Certificate Server
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Certificate Server version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view Certificate Authority (CA) client chains, subordinate certificates
may not be shown. In addition, some client chain verification code may not
identify subordinate certificates as valid.

CAUSE
=====

Certificate Server 1.0 root and subordinate CA certificates do not have the
critical flag set in the basic constraints extension, and the key usage bits are
not completely correct. Therefore, CA hierarchies do conform to the current IETF
standard. The current standard was issued after Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Option
Pack was released.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT Server, Certificate Server or Workstation 4.0
--------------------------------------------------------
