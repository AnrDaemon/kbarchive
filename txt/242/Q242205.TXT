SUMMARY
=======

There is a utility available in Windows NT 4.0 named RootUse.exe. The
RootUse.exe program is very similar in functionality to Novell's Maproot program
and allows you to assign network paths to a drive letter.

RootUse is not designed to replace NET USE. If you only want to connect to a
"\\<Server>\<Share>" (without the quotation marks), connect with NET
USE.

If you do not specify at least one folder within the share, the following error
message may be displayed:

   ERROR - Invalid Network Path

RootUse is not available to use with Windows 95 or Windows 98.

Syntax for RootUse.exe
----------------------

Root Use             Version 1.0(006)
Copyright 1997, Microsoft Corporation
-------------------------------------

USAGE:  rootuse [drive] [network path] [password] [switches]

/d               -     Delete a Connection
/u:<user name>   -     User Name to Connect As
                       /u:DOMAIN\username

NOTE:  * can be used for [drive] to use next available.
NOTE:  * can be used for [password] to get a prompt.

Any network connections made with the RootUse program MUST be removed using the
RootUse program. The results may be unpredictable if you use NET USE to remove
the connection. For example, you may still be able to gain access to the drive,
even though it is disconnected. If this occurs, delete the connection again
using RootUse. RootUse deletes the orphaned connection.

NOTE: RootUse can only remove orphaned links for the LanMan redirector. If the
orphaned link is for another redirector, you must restart your computer.
