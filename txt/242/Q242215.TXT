TITLE   :IAS RADIUS Realms/Prefixes Do Not Work Per Design Specifications

SYMPTOMS
========

Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) realms and prefixes do not
work as per the original design specification.

For example, define a RADIUS realm named "<realmname>" with an "m/" prefix
that grants users logon access only to the mail service. When a dial-up user
logs on to the Internet service provider (ISP) as "m/<username>", RADIUS
sees the "m/" prefix and applies the RADIUS profile, which restricts the user
account to accessing mail only. The "m/<username>" logon information is
then forwarded to the Microsoft Commercial Internet System (MCIS) Membership
server and the user is logged on with the appropriate restrictions.

If, however, the user logs on with an "M/" prefix, the RADIUS server does not
apply the "m/" profile because the RADIUS server is case sensitive for realms
and prefixes. The RADIUS server also forwards "M/<username>" to the MCIS
Membership server, and the user is successfully logged on without the necessary
restrictions. The Membership server successfully authenticates the user because
it is case insensitive for prefixes and realms.

Therefore, if a user types a realm and prefix in a different case than was
originally defined, the user bypasses the restrictions defined in the profile on
the RADIUS server. ISPs have no way to limit user access to the services that
they are providing to their users.
