PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you send a message from a computer running a double-byte character set (DBCS)
version of Lotus Notes to an Exchange Server computer through the Exchange Notes
Connector, DBCS characters in the Subject field may not be displayed properly
when you view the message in an e-mail client. This issue occurs when the
message is delivered to a recipient on the Exchange Server computer or an
Internet recipient through the Internet Mail Service.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs when the Exchange Server computer uses the wrong code page to
convert the message. The server may use the code page associated with the
Exchange Notes Connector's logon thread, rather than the default code page
associated with the connector.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
