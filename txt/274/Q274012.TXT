SYMPTOMS
========

No text appears after a double-byte character set (DBCS) character is written to
a file.

For instance, in the following code snippet, the text " There" is not written to
the STLout.txt file after the DBCS character 0x30F0 is written to a file.

   #include <fstream>

   void main()
   {
     wchar_t ch = 0x30F0; /* DBCS Japanese test character. */ 
     std::wofstream wfout;
     wfout.imbue(std::locale("Japanese"));
     wfout.open("STLout.txt");
     wfout << L"Hello";
     wfout << ch;  /* Write the DBCS character to the output text file. */ 
     //wfout.clear(); /* Workaround: Call clear() after the DBCS output. */ 
     wfout << L" There\n";  /* This is not written to the output text file. */ 
   }
