KEYWORDS:kbenv kbhw kbimu kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metal Gear Solid 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you play Microsoft Metal Gear Solid with a Microsoft SideWinder gamepad,
some game commands such as Switch Weapon or Switch Item may not function as
expected.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because some game commands, such as Switch Weapon or
Switch Item, require that you hold down the SHIFT key while you press a button
on the controller to activate the command.

NOTE: The game recognizes the START button on the Microsoft SideWinder gamepad as
the SHIFT key.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, press the START button on the SideWinder gamepad when you
use a command that requires you to hold down the SHIFT key.
