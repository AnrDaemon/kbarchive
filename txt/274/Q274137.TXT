TITLE   :XCLN: GetAssociatedAppointment CDO Method Returns Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the GetAssociatedAppointment method of Collaboration Data Objects
(CDO), you may get the following error message:

   MAPI_E_TOO_COMPLEX

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because CDO is looking for the date/time values on the
meeting response message, and when it does not find a date/time value on a
property, it uses the current date/time value as the default value. The values
are then compared with the date/time values that are stamped by the meeting
recipient. This date/time value is too old, and the MAPI_E_TOO_COMPLEX error
message is returned.

This behavior is more prevalent on Microsoft Outlook 2000 clients.

RESOLUTION
==========
