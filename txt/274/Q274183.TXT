SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to rename a public folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To change the name of a public folder, use either of the following methods:

 - Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, open the
   properties of the public folder that you want to change, click the General
   tab, and then modify the name. The name that is displayed on the General tab
   is the display name.

   -or-

 - If you have ownership rights to the folder, log on to the client computer,
   right-click the public folder that you want to rename, and then click Rename.

When you use the Administrator program, the public folder?s directory name is
displayed on the Advanced tab of the public folder properties. You cannot change
the directory name of a public folder. If you want to change a public folder's
directory name, download the public folder to a .pst file, republish the public
folder under a new name, and then delete the old public folder. However, it may
not be necessary to change the directory name because the directory name is only
displayed on the Advanced tab in the public folder properties in the
Administrator program.
