TITLE   :XADM: Messages with RTF Text Strings Not Delivered Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3 kbExchange550preSP5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Exchange Server, messages that contain Rich Text Format (RTF) text
strings are delivered without the correct RTF formatting.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because the information store uses a different mechanism to
parse RTF strings when the message is forwarded by a server-based rule such as
autoforwarding.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to

testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 service pack that contains
this fix.
