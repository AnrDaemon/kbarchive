TITLE   :CFS2: Aircraft Fly Past Target and Continue with Mission
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2: WWII Pacific Theater, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you play a custom mission in Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2 that was
built using Mission Builder, aircraft may not "search and destroy" a waypoint
correctly.

The aircraft fly past the waypoint, do not attack the target, and then continue
with the mission.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the aircraft in the mission are armed with any
ordinance other than bombs.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this issue from occurring, use Mission Builder to arm the aircraft in
the mission with bombs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When your mission is to attack a waypoint, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
Combat Flight Simulator 2 searches for targets within a 6 kilometer radius, and
then attacks the target at the waypoint by using the ordnance that you specify
in Mission Builder.
