TITLE   :MSN Explorer Address Picker puts addresses in the Subject box.
PRODUCT :The Microsoft Network
PROD/VER::Preview 2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSN Explorer, version Preview 2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Addresses selected from the address list start appearing in the Subject box,
instead of in the To box or the CC box.

CAUSE
=====

If a user opens the CC box and begins to enter addressees, then deletes the
addressees and closes the CC box, and then selects new addressees, the new
addressees may show up in the Subject line on the e-mail.

This is because the address list is still "focused on" or "pointed to" the CC
box, which no longer exists. The program drops the content into the next
available field, which is the Subject box.

RESOLUTION
==========

Either do not open the CC box, or leave it open.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MSN Explorer Mail.
