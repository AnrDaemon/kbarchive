To manually back up your saved games in Crimson Skies:

1. Quit Crimson Skies.

2. Right-click the Start button, and then click Explore.

3. Open the following default Crimson Skies installation folder

   <drive>:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Crimson Skies

   where <drive> is the letter of the hard disk on which Crimson Skies is
   installed.

NOTE: If you installed Crimson Skies to an alternate folder, browse to that
folder.

To restore the saved games that you copy to another folder, copy the SavedGames
folder from the location that you copied it to, back to the Crimson Skies
folder.

NOTE: When you copy the SavedGames folder back into the Crimson Skies folder, you
overwrite all the files in the SavedGames folder and any missions that you saved
after you copied the folder to the backup location.
