======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Inuse.exe utility to replace a system file, the temporary
environment variable must be set to the disk on which the %Systemroot% folder is
installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the computer restarts, the Inuse.exe utility defaults to either the
%Systemroot%\Temp or the %Systemroot%\Tmp folder location whenever the utility
looks for the specified file to replace. If this environment variable is changed
to another drive, the file replacement process does not occur, as expected, and
errors are not reported.
