TITLE   :MSN Companion Troubleshooting Tool HAMMER
PRODUCT :The Microsoft Network
PROD/VER:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

MSN Companion has several secret codes that give access to special
troubleshooting information on the device or that perform special
troubleshooting actions.

The HAMMER code resets all dialing options to their factory presets, but still
retains the local access numbers that the customer has chosen. It also sets the
local numbers to an unconfirmed state. This means that the next time you try to
dial the local access numbers, it will try all possible dialing combinations
(7-digit, 10-digit, 11-digit) for these numbers until it finds the right
combination and will then save the correct settings.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When should I use the "HAMMER" code?
------------------------------------

HAMMER should be used when you want to reset your dialing settings. A few
examples:

 - The telephone company changes the dialing rules in your area code, requiring
   you to dial the area code for some numbers.

 - You want to completely reset your dialing settings to the factory presets in
   order to troubleshoot a dialing problem. (Note: you will still need to use
   the "FIXIT" secret code to change the local access numbers. See See also:
   Q278481 - MSN Companion Troubleshooting Tool FIXIT)

How do I enter the "HAMMER" code?
---------------------------------

1. Turn on the MSN Companion and immediately click do not connect.

2. On the main troubleshooting page click I have some other problem that isn't
   described above.

3. In the text entry box type hammer and click Go.

4. The MSN Companion will reset all dialing settings (except the local access
   numbers) to their factory presets, and will restart.
