TITLE   :BUG: SET("FILTER") Converts Dates to Current Date Format
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp500 kbvfp500a kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp500aFIX kbvfp600 kbvfp600bug kbXBase KbDBFDBC kbGr

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you set a filter on a table involving a date field and then use the
SET("FILTER") function to see the filter, the date is converted according to the
current SET DATE setting. This is particularly likely to cause problems if SET
STRICTDATE is set to 1 or 2 in Visual FoxPro version 6.0. This behavior also
applies to the FILTER() function.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following code saves and restores the filter properly:

   *!* Save the current filter
   lcSetDate = SET("DATE")
   lcSetMark = SET("MARK")

   SET DATE TO YMD
   SET MARK TO "-"

   lcSetFilter = SET("FILTER")
   lcNewSetFilter = STRTRAN(lcSetFilter, "{", "{^")

   SET DATE TO &lcSetDate
   SET MARK TO "&lcSetMark"

   *!* Restore the old filter
   SET FILTER TO &lcNewSetFilter

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

To view the problem, run the following code in a .prg file:

   CREATE TABLE datetest (dField D)

   FOR i = 1 TO 10
      INSERT INTO datetest VALUES ({^2000-09-28} + i)
   ENDfor

   SET FILTER TO dField = {^2000-10-04}

   *!* Displays the problem under VFP6 only
   *!* SET STRICTDATE TO 2
   *!* lcFilter = SET("FILTER")
   *!* SET FILTER TO &lcFilter

   *!* Displays the problem under both VFP5 and 6 -
   *!* interprets date as April 10th
   lcSetDate = SET("DATE")
   SET DATE TO MDY
   lcFilter = SET("FILTER")
   SET DATE TO DMY

   SET FILTER TO &lcFilter

   SET DATE TO &lcSetDate
