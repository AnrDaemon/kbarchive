The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5

SYMPTOMS

following event ID message may be logged in the Application event log:

   Event ID: 179
   Source: MSExchangeDSExp
   Description: Unable to initialize directory user agent (DUA) workspace.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because there is a resource limitation in Dapi.dll; the
