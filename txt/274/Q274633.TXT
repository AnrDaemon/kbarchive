Unfortunately, there is no resolution for this at this time. Other screen
readers such as Jaws and Windows Eyes are compatible with this application.

MSN Explorer does incorporate Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA) software
which is a developer technology that improves the way programs and the operating
system work with accessibility aids. Using Active Accessibility, software
developers can make their programs more compatible with accessibility aids, and
accessibility aid developers can make more reliable, and robust, aids.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in ZoomText Screen Reader Software.
