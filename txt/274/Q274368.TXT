KEYWORDS:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When accessing the Internet with MSN Explorer a child using a Kid's Passport
tries to sign in to a site or service for which the parent has not yet chosen a
consent level. The site will ask if the Parent is present to grant permission.
The parent uses a Passport password to select a consent level: Deny, Limited, or
Full.

If the parent grants full consent, a "Congratulations" dialog box appears
indicating permission has been granted.

However, when the child attempts to sign into the site, the child is again denied
access and asked if the parent is present to grant permission.

CAUSE
=====

There is a slight XML conflict between Passport and MSN Explorer causing this.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Parent should go through the steps granting permission the second time. Once
completed the child account should be active.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MSN Passport Child's account.
