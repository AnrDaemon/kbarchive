TITLE   :MSN Companion user can send e-mail, but can't receive e-mail
PRODUCT :The Microsoft Network
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSN Companion, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

· The user can send e-mail, but has never successfully received e-mail.

CAUSE
=====

When the account was created, the e-mail routing was never set up properly, so
the e-mail messages sent to the customer never get routed to the Hotmail mailbox
that MSN Companion uses. The messages send successfully because the Hotmail
mailbox was created correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Escalate these types of users to MSNIANOC: Tell MSNIANOC that the user's
   email routing is not configured correctly for MSN Companion, and to run a
   standard e-mail reset with the user.
   When MSNIANOC responds saying that the user has been fixed, the user's e-mail
   issues will be resolved.

2. Send the customer an email to let them know that their e-mail is fixed, or
   call the user directly.
