======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Systems Management Server, when you are using the 3Com NIC Teaming
feature, or when you attempt to run Microsoft Network Monitor with the Receive
Load Balancing feature enabled, you may receive the following error message:

   The Receive Load Balancing feature-set is not available when running
   Microsoft Network Monitor.
   We have disabled the receive Load Balance Features.
   To enable Receive Load Balancing feature-set please uninstall Microsoft
   Network Monitor and reconfigure the Receive Load Balancing features.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because a feature in the 3COM Load Balancing software is
incompatible with Network Monitor. When the Receive Load Balancing feature is
running, Network Monitor cannot accurately determine usage or throughput.

This behavior occurs on servers that use dual network adapters and run the 3COM
Load Balancing software with Network Monitor.

WORKAROUND
==========

Network Monitor is only incompatible with the Receive Load Balancing feature.
When you configure the load balancing group to enable the Transmit Only Load
Balancing feature, Network Monitor functions as expected.
