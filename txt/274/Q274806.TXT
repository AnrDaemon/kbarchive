TITLE   :Browser Loops When User Password Expires
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::2.0,5.0

KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool kbOSWin2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Proxy Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a user's password expires, and the user tries to access a Uniform Resource
Locator (URL) through a secured server that is running Microsoft Proxy Server
(MPS) 2.0, the browser goes into a loop instead of redirecting the user to the
IISADMPWD virtual folder to allow them to change their user password.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if you are running MPS 2.0 under Internet Information
Services (IIS) 5.0, and if you are using proxy authentication to validate user
access. There is a functionality change in IIS 5.0 in how IIS handles password
expiration notification: an HTTP 302 redirect message is sent back to the
client.


The redirect path that is sent back to the client is the one that is specified in
the metabase. By default, this is specified as a relative path. For example, the
path that is sent back to the client when you are using secure password changes
is /IISADMPWD/Aexp.htr; therefore, the client tries to reconnect by appending
the redirect path to the originally requested URL. Because the server will then
check the logon credentials (which have expired) another HTTP 302 redirect call
is made, and this continues to occur, which causes the browser request to enter
into a loop.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, change the relative path that is specified in the
metabase to an absolute path. Use the Mdutil.exe utility that is included with
the Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6a (SP6a) source files, to set the appropriate
value in the metabase.

NOTE: Do not use the version that is included in the Windows NT Option Pack 4.0.
Also, this utility is not included in Windows 2000.

Change the appropriate metabase value based on whether you have set up the
computer to allow secured password changes or unsecured password changes. If you
are using secured password change pages, run the following command:

   mdutil.exe SET w3svc/AuthExpiredUrl
   "http://<servername>/iisadmpwd/aexp.htr"

If you are using unsecured password change pages, run the following command

   mdutil.exe SET w3svc/AuthExpiredUnsecureUrl
   "http://<servername>/iisadmpwd/aexp3.htr"

where <servername> is the computer name of your proxy server or a Fully
Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the proxy server.

NOTE: The quotation marks in these commands are not optional; they are used to
set a string value in the metabase.

After you have set the appropriate value, restart the IIS services by running the
Iisreset.exe command-line utility on the server.
