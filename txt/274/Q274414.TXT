TITLE   :"Log On As" Box Is Unavailable in the Services Tool on BDC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot change the "Log On As" properties for a service in the Services tool
in Control Panel because the Log On As box is unavailable for every service that
is running on a backup domain controller (BDC).

CAUSE
=====

This situation occurs on BDCs if the primary domain controller (PDC) for the
domain is unavailable.

This could occur if the PDC is offline, there is a network problem that prevents
communication between the BDC and PDC, or the secure channel from the BDC to the
PDC is not working.

RESOLUTION
==========

Re-establish communication between the BDC and the PDC and confirm that the
secure channel is in place and functioning.
