======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

TN3270 and TN5250 can be configured to use specific Transfer Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) ports. However, the Edit Control where the
specific port value is specified in SNA Manager allows a maximum of only four
digits to be entered, even though the maximum TCP/IP port value is 65535.

CAUSE
=====

The Edit Control incorrectly limits the port value to four digits.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack

WORKAROUND
==========

The SNA Server command-line configuration utility (Snacfg.exe) can be used to
enter TCP/IP ports values for TN3270 and TN5250 that contain five digits. The
following is an example of how to set a port value of 12345 by using SNACFG for
both TN3270 and TN5250:

TN3270

SNACFG tn3server <servername> /portnumber:12345

TN5250

SNACFG tn5server <servername> /portnumber:12345

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server versions
3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, and
Host Integration Server 2000.

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Both TN3270 and TN5250 use TCP/IP port 23, by default. If both services will be
used on the same SNA Server system, then one of them must be configured to use a
different port. In addition, some customers may want to use nonstandard ports
for TN3270 and TN5250 for security reasons.

The following explains how to specify the use of specific ports for TN3270 and
TN5250 when using SNA Manager:

1. Open SNA Manager (Snaexp.exe).

2. Right-click TN3270 (or TN5250) in the left pane of the SNA Manager window.

3. Click Properties.

4. Click the Use option in the Port section of the TN3270 Properties (or TN5250
   Properties) dialog box.

5. Type in a specific port value.

Only four digits can be entered when you are specifying the port value in this
manner. If SNACFG is used to specify the port as described previously, SNA
Manager will correctly show the five-digit value in the port Edit Control.
