SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to gain access to a Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) server that
also has Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) enabled, you may receive the following
warning message:

   Security Information

   This page contains both secure and nonsecure items. Do you want to display the
   nonsecure items?

If you click Yes, the OWA logon page is displayed and you can continue to work as
usual. If you click No, the OWA connection is cancelled.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because Uniform Resource Locator (URL) scripts that are
written in JavaScript or the Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBscript)
are treated as nonsecure data in Internet Explorer 5.5. The warning message in
the "Symptoms" section of this article is displayed each time that you encounter
one of these URLs, which is the case in OWA.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, either use an earlier version of Internet Explorer,
or click Yes when the warning message in the "Symptoms" section of this article
is displayed. If you do so, you can log on to the OWA server normally.

NOTE: If you click Yes, you simply ignore the warning message; the secure channel
is maintained and security is not jeopardized.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
