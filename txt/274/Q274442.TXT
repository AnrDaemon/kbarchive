TITLE   :Windows 95/98/Me Users Cannot Process a Logon Script
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::2000,2000 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Datacenter Server 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 2000, 2000 SP1 Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
 - Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Users that log on to Microsoft Windows 95-based, Microsoft Windows 98-based, and
Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition-based clients cannot process the logon
script assigned to their domain user accounts. However, when the same user logs
on to the domain from a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0-based or Microsoft Windows
2000-based computer, the logon script processes properly.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Millennium
Edition operating systems cannot process the .cmd extension.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, you can use either of the following two methods:

 - Change the extension on the file from .cmd to .bat.

-or-

 - Associate the .cmd extension with Command.com.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The preceding clients do not support the use of long file names with logon
scripts. Use Microsoft MS-DOS version 8.3 naming conventions when you name the
logon script file.
