The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you install any post-Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 (SP3) information
store hotfix (between build 5.5.2652.68 and 5.5.2653.16), you may receive
duplicate messages when the message was originally sent to you or to a
distribution list that includes your mailbox.

CAUSE

Any information store fix after build 5.5.2652.68 has been changed to use the
Internet ID globally unique identifier (GUID) instead of the Instance ID to
track message duplication. The local delivery pointer is not initialized
correctly after the modification.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
