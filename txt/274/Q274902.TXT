-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you press ALT+TAB to switch to the Microsoft Windows desktop or to another
program and then press ALT+TAB again to switch back to Microsoft Combat Flight
Simulator 2, you may unexpectedly disable certain graphics options in the game.

For example, dithering may be turned off.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Windows color palette is set to True Color (32
bit).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, reduce the Windows color palette setting:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Display.

3. Click the Settings tab.

4. In the Colors or Color Palette box, click High Color (16 bit) or True Color
   (24 bit), and then click OK.

NOTE: If neither of these settings is available, your video adapter does not
support lower color palette settings.

5. If you are prompted to restart the computer, do so.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Combat Flight
Simulator 2: WWII Pacific Theater, version 1.0.
