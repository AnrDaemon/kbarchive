SUMMARY
=======

You are able to open multiple Contacts folders from different Exchange Server
5.5 mailboxes in one Outlook Address Book as long as you have the correct
permissions to access the additional mailboxes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To open Contacts folders from more than one mailbox, follow these steps:

1. Create a profile for one mailbox, for example, <Mailbox1>, and then add
   the Outlook Address Book to the profile.

2. Start Outlook and log on to <Mailbox1>. Right-click the Contacts
   folder, and then click Properties.

3. Click the Outlook Address Book tab, and then click to select the "Show this
   folder as an e-mail Address Book" check box.

4. Quit Outlook.

5. Open the profile for <Mailbox1>, remove the Exchange Server service
   from the profile, then add it again.

6. Start Outlook and log on to a different mailbox, for example,
   <Mailbox2>. Right-click the Contacts folder, and then click Properties.

7. Click the Outlook Address Book tab, and then click to select the "Show this
   folder as an e-mail Address Book" check box.

You are now able to access <Mailbox1> and <Mailbox2>. To verify that
you can do this, check the properties for the Outlook Address Book.

NOTE: To access both Contacts folders successfully, the associated Windows
account must have the correct permissions to access both mailboxes.
