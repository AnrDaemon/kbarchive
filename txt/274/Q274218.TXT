TITLE   :Server Returns "Diagnostic 52" When Deleting Replicated Object
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1,2.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services, versions 2.1, 2.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using Compass, you cannot delete an object in the directory. When you
attempt to do so, you receive the following error message:

   Diagnostic returned: 52.

CAUSE
=====

The object that you are trying to delete was originally created through a
replication agreement, and therefore contains a referral to the original object
on the supplier computer, but the supplier computer cannot be contacted. This
may be either a temporary, or permanent circumstance. When the consumer server
receives the delete request, it attempts to contact the original (supplier)
Microsoft Metadirectory Services (MMS) computer. Because that computer cannot be
reached, the delete attempt does not succeed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this behavior, you must temporarily modify the mode of the request,
delete the object, and then reset the mode to its original form. To change the
mode, follow these steps:

1. In Compass, log on to the consumer MMS server.

2. On the Options menu, click "Refer to", and then click Local Server.

3. Using Compass, right-click the object that you want to remove, and then click
   Delete.

    - If you want to delete only the selected object, click "Delete selected
      entries".

    - If you want to delete only the objects below the selected object, click
      "Delete child entries only".

4. On the Options menu, click "Refer to", and then click The Known Universe.
