SUMMARY
=======

This article describes documenation errors in the Pilot's Manual for Microsoft
Combat Flight Simulator 2: WWII Pacific Theater.

MORE INFORMATION
================

 - The "Training Missions" section on page 134 of the Pilot's Manual for
   Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2 incorrectly states that you receive a
   combat flight certificate when you graduate from the complete in-flight
   training course.

   You do not receive a certificate when you graduate from the complete in-flight
   training course.

 - Page 134 of the Combat Flight Simulator 2 Pilot's Manual contains incorrect
   steps about how to select individual training missions.

   To select individual training missions:

   1. On the main screen, click Training Missions.

   2. Click either "American" or "Japanese", and then click Next.

   3. Select the mission that you want, and then click Next.

   4. Click the aircraft that you want to use, and then click Fly Now.

 - Page 21 of the Pilot's Manual for Combat Flight Simulator 2 states that you
   can enter your name on the Top Ten screen.

   This feature does not exist in the game.

 - Page 49 of the Pilot's Manual for Combat Flight Simulator 2 states that you
   can find a "best glide speed" chart in the "planes" section of the "Machines
   of War" chapter. This is incorrect. The best glide speeds are listed on page
   89 in Chapter 5, "Emergency Procedures."

 - Page 227 of the Pilot's Manual for Combat Flight Simulator 2 states that you
   can press CTRL+T or the R key to toggle the Select time compression feature,
   which indicates that you can press these keys to cycle through the different
   rates of time compression. This is incorrect. These keys can only be used to
   increase the Time Compression rate. If you want to decrease the simulation
   rate after increasing it you will need to press ALT and change the Simulation
   Rate in the Options menu.

 - The Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2 manual incorrectly refers to best
   climb speeds and best glide speeds. Page 49 of the manual describes several
   flight maneuvers and states:

   "To find your aircraft's best-climb speed, see the chart in the 'Planes'
   section of the Machines of War chapter."

   This information is not available in this chapter nor is it available in the
   Combat Flight Simulator 2 Help, which refers you to the same chapter. The
   information for best glide speeds is also unavailable.

 - The Key Commands Quick Reference on the back cover of the Microsoft Combat
   Flight Simulator 2 Pilot's manual incorrectly lists CTRL+Q as the keyboard
   command to exit the game immediately. The correct keyboard command to exit
   the game immediately is CTRL+BREAK.

 - The Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2 Pilot's Manual incorrectly states
   that you can drop torpedoes. Only computer-controlled aircraft and boats can
   drop torpedoes in Combat Flight Simulator 2. The following aircraft and boats
   can drop torpedoes in Combat Flight Simulator 2:

    - Douglas TBD-1 Devastator

    - Grumman TBF Avenger

    - Nakajima B5N2 (Kate)

    - Tidori Class Torpedo Boat
