SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to change an e-mail alias in the Simple Mail Transfer
Protocol (SMTP) proxy address.

MORE INFORMATION
================

As an administrator, you can change a user's e-mail alias. To ensure that the
user continues to receive messages that are sent to their previous e-mail
address, follow these steps:

1. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program and locate the user whose
   e-mail address alias you want to change.

2. Right-click the user and click Properties.

3. Click the E-mail Address tab, click New, click Internet Address, and then
   click OK.

4. Type a new e-mail address, for example,
   <newalias>@<yourdomainname>.com.

5. Click the address you just created, and then click to select the "Set as
   Reply Address" check box.

When you change the user's alias name in the Administrator program, you do not
change the user's e-mail alias.
