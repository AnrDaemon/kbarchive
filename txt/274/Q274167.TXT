PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbDataview kbDebug kbMDAC kbSQLServ kbStoredProc kbTSQL kbGrpDSVBDB kbGrpDSM

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you right-click on the Tables or Views folders (or items within those
folders) under a Data Link connected to a SQL 2000 Server, the New Table, New
View, Design Table, Design View, and Filter By Owner menu items do not appear.
These choices exist with SQL Server 7.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the next service pack for
Visual Studio 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open a DataProject in Visual Basic 6.0.

2. Create a connection to SQL Server 2000 in the DataEnvironment.

3. Open the DataView window and expand the connection.

4. Right-click the Table folder.

NOTE: If Visual Studio 6.00 Service Pack 5 has been applied, you see New in the
context menu.

The New option displays the following error message:

   The Visual Database Tools within Visual Studio 6 and Access 2000 do not
   support some new features of SQL Server 2000. Because you are manipulating an
   object in a SQL Server 2000 database, some operations will be unavailable to
   you. In rare cases, you might not be able to save the database object you
   modified. In other cases, you will be able to save the object, but its
   previously existing settings for features new to SQL Server 2000 will be
   lost. In most of these cases, you will be warned if the Save operation will
   eliminate existing settings or property values.

   For a complete description of the interaction between SQL Server 2000 and
   Visual Database Tools within Visual Studio 6 or Access 2000, see Microsoft
   Knowledge Base article Q266277, "Using Visual Studio 6 and Access 2000 Visual
   Database Tools with SQL Server 2000." Knowledge Base articles are available
   in the MSDN Library Visual Studio documentation or at
   http://support.microsoft.com/support/.

   To suppress this message next time you design a SQL Server 2000 object from
   Visual Studio 6 or Access 2000, check the following box.
