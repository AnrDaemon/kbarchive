KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When changes are replicated from Exchange Server 5.5 directory objects to
Windows 2000 Active Directory across the Active Directory Connector (ADC), the
replication may create new objects instead of modifying the existing Active
Directory account that is associated with the mailbox.

You may find the following information in the Ex55-2failed.ldf file:

   ADC could not replicate the msExchMasterAccountSid to CN=Winks\,
   Hank,CN=Users,DC=ACP-INC,DC=LOCAL because this sid is already on the object
   CN=Hank Winks,OU=ACP,DC=ACP-INC,DC=LOCAL. (Connection Agreement
   'Exchange/Windows CA MLC 9-11-00' #2200) For more information, click

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the msExchADCGlobalNames value of the existing Active
Directory object is either missing or corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use the ADSI Edit snap-in, the LDP utility, or any other LDAP
version 3 client and incorrectly modify the attributes of Active Directory
objects, you can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall
Microsoft Windows 2000 Server and/or Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect modification of
Active Directory object attributes can be solved. Modify these attributes at
your own risk.

To resolve this issue:

1. Use the Active Directory Administration tool or the Active Directory Service
   Interface (ADSI) Edit snap-in to copy the msExchADCGlobalNames value from the
   newly created object to the msExchADCGlobalNames value of the existing
   object.

2. Verify that the values are identical.

3. Delete the new object.
