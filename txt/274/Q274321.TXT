CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because when you upgrade a server that is a domain
controller from Windows NT Server 4.0 to Windows 2000 Server, the domain is
removed and then re-intialized with Active Directory, and the Exchange Server
service account loses membership to the local Administrators group.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. In the Active Directory Users and Computers Microsoft Management Console
   (MMC) snap-in, click the Users container, and then double-click the service
   account user.

2. Click the Member Of tab.

3. Make sure that the service account is a member of the Domain Administrators
   group.

4. If the service account is member of the Domain Users group only, click Add,
   and then add the Domain Administrators group to the membership list.
