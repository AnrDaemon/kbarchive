-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSN Companion, versions 1.0, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

E-mail functionality in MSN Companion does not work. This issue may occur at any
point in the MSN Companion interface when you use e-mail, including the Setup
sequence or "out of box experience" (OOBE).

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by one of two events:

 - The Hotmail e-mail servers are down.

 - The Hotmail distributed authoring and versioning (DAV) service that allows
   MSN Companion to access the mailbox is down.

RESOLUTION
==========

To determine whether Hotmail outage is affecting your ability to access e-mail
in MSN Companion, attempt to access Hotmail using Outlook Express.
 
To determine whether Hotmail outage is affecting your ability to access e-mail in
MSN Companion

1. Identify an existing Hotmail account you can use to test this issue,
   preferably a test account.

2. In Outlook Express, click Tools, and then click Accounts.

3. Click Add, click Mail, enter the Hotmail e-mail address in the test box, and
   then click Next.

4. Click Next again, and then enter the password for the Hotmail account in the
   text box.

5. Click Next, and then click Finish.
   Now you can see your Hotmail mailbox in Outlook Express.

6. Click Tools, click Account, and set this account as the default mail account,
   so that all new mail you send will get sent from this specific Hotmail
   account.

7. Go to the Inbox for the Hotmail account you specified.
   If there is an error, Hotmail may be temporarily down.

8. Send an e-mail message to yourself.
   If the message does not get sent and an error appears, Hotmail is temporarily
   down.

9. If Hotmail is down, try again in a few minutes or hours.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MSN Companion Version#1.0.
