TITLE   :PRB: Page Size of Embedded Word File Changes When Edited

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you embed a Microsoft Word file in a general field and then edit it, the
document may resize to fit the window.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, use a Linked document instead of an Embedded document. To
do so, follow the steps in the "More Information" section, but add the LINK
keyword to the APPEND GENERAL statement.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Type the following code into the Command window, and when prompted, choose a
   Word document:

   CREATE TABLE wordTable (gWordDoc G)
   APPEND BLANK
   APPEND GENERAL gWordDoc FROM GETFILE("doc") CLASS "Word.Application"
   BROWSE

2. Double-click the "Gen" record.

3. Resize the window to a different width than the displayed document.

4. Close the window, and then reopen it.

5. Double-click the document.

The document appears with new margins, matching the width of the window. If you
are working in Visual FoxPro version 3, the size changes to a consistent value,
instead of being dependent on the window width.

If you edit the general field in an OLEBoundControl instead, and use the
DoVerb(-2) method, it will open in Word. If you then click Page Setup from the
File menu, you can determine whether the paper size is different from the
original size.
