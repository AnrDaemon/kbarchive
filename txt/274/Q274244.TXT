SYMPTOMS
========

On Microsoft Windows 2000-based Systems Management Server (SMS) clients that use
the SNMP Event to Trap Translator tool, when you attempt to configure traps,
some event descriptions may be truncated after the first letter. Although this
is a cosmetic problem only, it makes it difficult to configure clients
appropriately.

message dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are included with Windows 2000.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
