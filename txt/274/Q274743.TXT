TITLE   :SMS: SQL Error 3023 in Collection Evaluator Log
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbServer kbsms200 kbCollections kbsmsUtil

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0

SYMPTOMS
========

The Collection Evaluator component, along with various other Systems Management
Server (SMS) components, may generate an SQL error 3023 if it runs during the
backup of the SMS database.

The following error messages is generated in the Colleval.log file on the site
server:

   ********~Evaluating SMS00007
   Next due date for collection SMS00007 is 09/26/00 11:00:00
   Preparing to refresh collection SMS00007
   SQL Err #10007> General SQL Server error: Check messages from the SQL
   Server.
   SQL Msg #3023> Backup, CHECKALLOC, bulk copy, SELECT INTO, and file
   manipulation (such as CREATE FILE) operations on a database must be
   serialized. Reissue the statement after the current backup, CHECKALLOC, or
   file manipulation operation is completed.
   CCollectionSource_SQL::RefreshResults - could not create index
   Could not refresh collection SMS00007. Will retry later.

CAUSE
=====

These messages can appear if the SMS services are allowed to run while the
backup operation is in progress, and a component attempts a database operation.

Some SQL operations are serial in nature, meaning that only one operation can be
performed at a time while this operation is in a running state. The backup
operation is one such operation. Any operations specified in the error message
in the "Symptoms" section may fail, and generate a 3023 error message while the
backup operation is running. This creates the need to shut down all SMS services
before starting an SMS database backup.

The Backup SMS Site Server database maintenance task that is included with SMS
2.0 stops the necessary SMS services during execution. Using other methods to
perform the same task may result in this error message if the SMS services are
not shut down prior to performing the backup.

WORKAROUND
==========

It is highly recommended that the SMS database maintenance task be used to shut
down the SMS services, and also to back up the SMS database, files, and
registry.

For additional information on how to perform a backup of the SMS database refer
to Chapter 18, "Maintaining SMS Systems" in the Microsoft Systems Management
Server 2.0 Administrator's Guide.
