PRODUCT :Microsoft Developer Network
PROD/VER::July 2000
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbMSDN kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) July 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The update of the HTML Help System during the installation of the Microsoft
Developers Network (MSDN) Library breaks the Microsoft Windows 2000 Help
system.

During the installation of the MSDN Library (usually, but not limited to the
April 2000 or July 2000 editions), the MSDN Library installation program
attempts to update the HTML Help System. The update fails due to not having the
required permissions. (The installation is denied rights to do so due to the
Windows file system protection feature.) Although the installation attempt fails
and the update has not been completed, the HTML Help system is not able to
display the MSDN Library correctly when started.

The following MSDN Library (any edition) error messages appear:

   "unable to find the collection \..\msdn***.col"

   -or-

   "Can not open the MSDN010.COL"

The exact error depends on the version of the MSDN Library being started.

CAUSE
=====

The MSDN Library updates some of the underlying files, but is not able to
complete the HTML Help system update.

==========
