To troubleshoot game controller issues in Metal Gear Solid, use the following
methods in the order in which they are listed.

Confirm That Your Game Controller Is Assigned to Controller ID 1
----------------------------------------------------------------

Many games do not recognize game controllers that are not assigned to Controller
ID 1. To verify that your game controller is assigned to Controller ID 1:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Game Controllers.

3. Click the Advanced tab.

4. If the game controller that you want to use is not assigned to ID 1, click
   Change.

   If the game controller that you want to use is assigned to ID 1, proceed to
   the next method.

5. In the Game Controllers box, click the game controller that you want to use,
   and then click the Up Arrow or Down Arrow to change the Selected ID value to
   1.

6. Click OK, and then click OK again.

7. Close Control Panel.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Reduce the Hardware Sound Acceleration Level Setting
----------------------------------------------------

To reduce the Hardware Sound Acceleration Level setting:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "dxdiag" (without the quotation marks), and then click
   OK.

3. Click the Sound tab.

4. Under DirectX Features, move the Hardware Sound Acceleration Level slider all
   the way to the left (the "No acceleration" setting).

5. Click Exit.

NOTE: The DirectX Diagnostic Tool (Dxdiag.exe) is installed with Microsoft
DirectX 6.0 or later. DirectX 7.0a is installed with Metal Gear Solid.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Obtain and Install Updated Device Drivers
-----------------------------------------

Contact the manufacturer of your game controller to inquire about how to obtain
and install the latest version of the driver for your game controller. If you
connect your game controller to a game port on your sound card, contact the
manufacturer of your sound card to inquire about how to obtain and install the
latest version of the sound driver for your sound card.
