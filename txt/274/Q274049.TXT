SYMPTOMS
========

When you use one of the Encarta programs listed at the beginning of this
article, you may be unable to use the Text-to-Speech or the Voice Control
feature in Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia or record sounds properly in the
Microsoft Encarta Language Learning programs.

In addition, you may receive error messages stating that your sound card is not
configured properly.

NOTE: The sound recording function in Microsoft Windows may still work properly.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if more than one sound card is installed in your
computer.

The recording software that is installed with Encarta Encyclopedia and the
Encarta Language Learning programs is associated with a particular sound device.
If more than one sound device is installed in the computer, the Encarta program
may not be associated with the sound device that is associated with sound
recording and playback in Windows.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, temporarily disable the sound device that the Encarta
program is associated with, and then uninstall and reinstall the Encarta
program.
