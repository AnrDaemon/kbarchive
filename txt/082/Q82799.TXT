 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When using Microsoft Windows TrueType fonts with applications that
support Page View or other condensed views such as Fit to Page or Fit
to Window, TrueType bold and bold italic fonts no longer appear bold.

This problem is the result of applications reducing the line widths of
fonts to one pixel on the display, and is done intentionally for
readability. When displayed in actual size or printed, the text will
appear as bold.
