SUMMARY
=======

The number of TrueType fonts in the Microsoft Windows operating system version
3.1 are limited by the following items:

 - The number of fonts that can be declared in the WIN.INI file

   The WIN.INI file cannot be larger than 64K. This allows for between 500 and
   1000 fonts to be declared (depending on the length of the filenames and
   paths).

 - The number of fonts than can be used simultaneously during a Windows session

   The Graphical Device Interface (GDI) internal tables allow no more than 1600
   entries. There are stricter limitations because of the size of the TrueType
   data segment and the number of selectors available in the system. Between 300
   and 800 different fonts can be used simultaneously during a Windows session.


 - The number of fonts that can be printed on the same document
