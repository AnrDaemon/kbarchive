-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how Microsoft Windows handles memory on a system running
EMM386.EXE.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Include/Exclude Precedence
--------------------------

An X= parameter added to the EMM386.EXE device line is directly adopted by
Windows. Any EMMInclude= or EMMExclude= entry is overridden by any X= parameter
on the EMM386.EXE device line in the CONFIG.SYS file. For example, the following
line in your CONFIG.SYS takes precedence over any conflicting entry:

        device=c:\windows\emm386.exe X=C000-CFFF noems

When Windows executes, it takes this information before it checks the SYSTEM.INI
file. Even if the SYSTEM.INI file contains a contradictory line, for example:

        EMMInclude=C000-CFFF

Windows keeps the EMM386.EXE parameter.

The same precedence that an EMM386.EXE exclusion takes is true for the I=
(inclusion) parameter.

DMA Buffer Size Parameter
-------------------------

The D= (DMA buffer size) parameter is not adopted by Windows. If it is necessary
to allocate a larger DMA buffer for EMM386.EXE, it is probably necessary to add
the following to the CONFIG.SYS file. For example, add:

   device=c:\windows\emm386.exe D=96 noems

This would affect anything running under MS-DOS. However, when Windows is
started, the DMA buffer size returns to its default. For the above example, you
should also add the following line to the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI
file:

   DMABufferSize=96
