When version 1.2 of Micrografx' ABC Flowcharter is run under Windows version
3.1, too few font sizes may be listed for the TrueType fonts when certain
printers are selected.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With either the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet IIP or IIID as the selected
printer, only one point size is listed for all the TrueType fonts. With the
Epson LQ-2550, no TrueType fonts are listed. However, with the Apple LaserWriter
selected, an entire range of font sizes is listed for each of the TrueType
fonts.
