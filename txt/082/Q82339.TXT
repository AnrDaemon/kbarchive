PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) Pathworks driver and
Windows version 3.1, you may receive the following error message when you try to
print:

   <printer name> on \\SERVER\PRINTER [NETWORK_ERROR]

where <printer name> is the installed network printer.

The problem occurs when the network printer is attached to another workstation or
not directly connected to the server.

CAUSE
=====

There is a problem with the interface between the Windows Print Manager and the
DEC Pathworks driver. Print Manager thinks that there is some sort of network
error, but the printer is online and the printer receives print jobs correctly
from Windows 3.1.

WORKAROUND
==========

No corrective action is necessary. Print Manager is displaying the wrong
message. The printer functions properly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.

The DEC product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
