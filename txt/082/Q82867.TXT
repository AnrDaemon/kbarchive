SUMMARY
=======

In Aldus Persuasion for Windows, simulated italic fonts are spaced wider apart
than they should be. The problem is in Persuasion and occurs in the Windows 3.0
and 3.1.

This problem can be observed when Symbol italic is chosen and the PostScript
printer driver is active.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Persuasion does not expect device fonts to have an overhang. In the case of a
symbol TrueType font, GDI has to do the italic simulation of a device symbol
font. In this case, each character in the device font will be sheared to appear
italicized. The width of each of these characters includes the amount of
overhang over the next character.

While composing text with these characters, and when a DX array is specified, the
application must take out the overhang value from the width of each character.
Persuasion is not doing this and as a result, the characters appear spaced out.

Support.
