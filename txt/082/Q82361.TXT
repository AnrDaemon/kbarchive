======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you start Norton Desktop for Windows (NDW) under Microsoft Windows and you
have a printer connected with the appropriate printer driver installed, NDW
stops responding (hangs) when you do the following:

1. Double-click the MS-DOS Prompt icon in Windows 3.1 to execute an MS-DOS
   session.

2. Choose NDW's Printer Icon button.

3. Choose Browse.

4. Choose Refresh.

5. Choose Cancel before the refresh function has completed.

After you choose Cancel, any subsequent action causes an application error.
Choosing the Close button in the application error dialog box hangs NDW. If you
press CTRL+ALT+DEL, the system returns to Program Manager, but the screen is
corrupted. If you choose Exit from the File menu, Program Manager hangs,
requiring you to press CTRL+ALT+DEL to exit Windows.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by a problem in NDW, not in Windows.
