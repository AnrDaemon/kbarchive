The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Shell (for example, Program Manager) and OLE registration information is stored
in .REG files that are used by the Registration Editor (REGEDIT.EXE) to add
information to the registration database, REG.DAT. There is no difference
between the way the Microsoft Windows version 3.1 Setup program originally
registers this information and the way an application can be re- registered.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows 3.1 Setup program calls WinExec("REGEDIT /S /U SETUP.REG", ...).
This executes REGEDIT.EXE under Windows. This is the same as choosing Run from
the File menu of either Program Manager or File Manager and typing the following
line in the Command Line box:

   REGEDIT SETUP.REG

Therefore, if your registration information for Windows 3.1 accessory
applications (ONLY those applications that ship with Windows 3.1, such as
Paintbrush and Write) has been lost, you can restore it by typing the above line
in the Command Line box as described above.
