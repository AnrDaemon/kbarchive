TITLE   :Windows Err Msg: Unable to Use XXXX.BMP As a Desktop Bitmap
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the desktop wallpaper feature in the Windows 3.0 Control Panel, the
following error message may be displayed:

   Unable to Use XXXX.BMP As a Desktop Bitmap

where XXXX.BMP is the filename of a bitmap.

CAUSE
=====

Any of the following can cause this problem:

 - There is not enough free memory or free system resources to display the
   picture.

 - The picture is not a valid bitmap (.BMP) file.

 - The path to the bitmap is incorrect when selecting a bitmap from another
   directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

Verifying There Is Enough Memory
--------------------------------

To verify that there is enough memory or resources, make sure that Windows is not
running in real mode. Real mode may not allocate enough free memory or system
resources to Windows to display a bitmap as a background wallpaper. Large
bitmaps, such as CHESS.BMP, cannot run in real mode. Large bitmaps such as this
CHESS.BMP require more free memory than is likely to be available in real mode.

Verifying the Picture Is a Bitmap
---------------------------------

To verify that the picture is a valid bitmap, do the following:

1. Load the file into Paintbrush.

2. Save the picture, as a bitmap called TEST.BMP, to the WINDOWS directory.

3. Run Control Panel and choose the Desktop icon.

4. In the Wallpaper section, select TEST.BMP. (Note: If Windows is running in
   real mode, you must restart Windows in order to see the new wallpaper.)

Selecting a Bitmap as Wallpaper
-------------------------------

To select a bitmap for use as wallpaper from another directory:

1. Run Control Panel and choose the Desktop icon.

2. In the Wallpaper section, enter the complete path and filename of the bitmap.
   This will copy the bitmap to the Windows program directory and select it for
   use as a wallpaper. The bitmap must be copied because Windows looks for
   bitmaps located within the Windows program directory only.
