======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If WordPerfect is run in a window under the Microsoft Windows, the mouse pointer
in the WordPerfect window may not match the mouse pointer in Windows.

When WordPerfect is run in a window, a small black bar appears across the bottom
of the window.

CAUSE
=====

WordPerfect version 5.1 performs its own internal mouse acceleration.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, disable WordPerfect's mouse acceleration feature and
then "trap" the mouse during each WordPerfect session.

To disable WordPerfect mouse acceleration and "trap" the mouse, perform the
following steps:

1. In WordPerfect, press SHIFT+F1.

2. Press M for Mouse.

3. Press A for Acceleration Factor.

4. Set the Acceleration Factor to 1.

5. Press ENTER three times to return to your document.

6. Enlarge the WordPerfect window to fill the entire screen.

7. Move the Windows mouse pointer into the WordPerfect window, and then move it
   to the far-right edge of the window.

8. Move the mouse pointer to the far-left edge of the window.

9. Move the pointer back to the center of the window, and then move it down to
   the bottom edge.

10. Move the pointer up to the upper-left corner of the window.

The Windows mouse pointer and the WordPerfect mouse pointer should now be in the
same location.
