The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When installing, LOCKIT fails to include the space needed before its name on the
load= line in the WIN.INI file. This causes problems if another application is
already on the load= line. The solution is to add a space between LOCKIT.EXE and
any other application names that appear on the load= line.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Applications that load automatically modify the WIN.INI file in the WINDOWS
directory (in particular the LOAD= line in WIN.INI). If multiple applications
start at Windows start time, then a space is needed between each application
name.
