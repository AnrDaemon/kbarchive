SUMMARY
=======

Popup Window is a ROM-based utility on Toshiba laptops that includes several
battery-saving functions. This utility does not work properly with Microsoft
Windows version 3.0 running in 386 enhanced mode.

To work around this problem, obtain the WINTOSH.ZIP shareware utility program
from the Toshiba BBS. This utility is designed to replace Popup Window while
running 386 enhanced mode Windows.

This shareware utility program is also available on CompuServe under the name
WINTSH.ZIP.

NOTE: This shareware utility was NOT created by Toshiba and is updated by its
author on an ongoing basis.

MORE INFORMATION
================

According to Toshiba Technical Support, the battery-saving software cannot make
the appropriate calls to the ROM BIOS while Windows is operating in 386 enhanced
mode.

Toshiba reports that the Popup Window utility works properly in the real and
standard modes of Windows.
