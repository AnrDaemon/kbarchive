-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Squish disk-compression utility by Sundog Software, Microsoft
Windows is unable to recognize a permanent swap file in 386 enhanced mode.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by an entry that Squish makes in the CONFIG.SYS file.

Squish compresses a portion of the hard disk in order to free up more space.
Squish requires a line in the CONFIG.SYS file, similar to the following

   DEVICE=[DRIVE]:[PATH]\SQUISH\SQPLUS.SYS EMS=0

where "[DRIVE]" and "[PATH]" indicate the location of SQPLUS.SYS.

If Windows creates a permanent swap file, it can't locate the swap file during
386 enhanced mode operation. The Windows Setup program indicates that a
temporary swap file is active.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the SQPLUS.SYS device driver from the CONFIG.SYS file so that Windows can
recognize the permanent swap file.
