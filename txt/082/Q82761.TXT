The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Windows version 3.1, if you use the PostScript driver version 3.5 to print a
document with a large number of fonts to a PostScript printer, the printer may
be reset. This causes the printer to print its startup page in the middle of the
original print job.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is usually the result of overflowing the PostScript printer's
memory. Many older PostScript printers do not have a large amount of printer
memory. This is a limitation of the printer's hardware.

WORKAROUND
==========

Follow these steps to work around the problem:

1. From Control Panel, choose the Printers icon.

2. Choose the Setup button.

3. Choose the Options button.

4. Choose the Advanced button.

5. Select Clear Memory Per Page. Make sure the Use Substitution Tab box is
   selected. This option causes the printer driver to remap TrueType fonts to
   the resident PostScript fonts built into the printer.

6. If the problem still occurs, reformat the document using fewer fonts or more
   printer-resident fonts rather than downloadable fonts.

7. If the problem still occurs, scale down the size of bitmaps to make more
   printer memory available.
