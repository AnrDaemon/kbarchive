======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After Dark and all other Microsoft Windows 3.0 screen savers are corrupted by
pull-down menus when they are run in Windows version 3.1 or 3.11.

This problem does not occur with Windows 3.0.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Windows 3.0 screen savers are not aware of topmost
windows. Windows 3.1 menus are topmost. A Windows 3.1 compatible screen saver
from the application vender is required to hide the pull-down menu.

In addition, Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 screen savers do not start if a pull-down
menu is currently displayed (that is, when the menu is pulled down).

WORKAROUND
==========

Use only Windows 3.1 compatible screen savers with Windows 3.1 or 3.11.

The product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance
or reliability.
