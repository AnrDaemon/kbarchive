======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When run under Windows, the Attachmate 3.21 Preferences and Fonts New Courier
selection lists the font size "24" four times. It seems there are no different
font sizes available.

CAUSE
=====

This is not a problem; the application is listing the name four times because of
the four formats of the font: regular, bold, italic, and bold- italic.

WordPerfect for Windows version 5.1 and Juggler also list multiple fonts of the
same family.
