SUMMARY
=======

By default, Microsoft Windows does not support using two CD-ROM drives to play
CD Audio. However, by making a change to the SYSTEM.INI file, you can enable
Windows to support using two CD-ROM drives to play CD Audio.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To enable support for two CD-ROM drives, use a text editor (for example,
Notepad) to edit your SYSTEM.INI file as follows:

Under the [mci] section, which appears as

      [mci]
      CDAudio=mcicda.drv

add the line

   CDAudio1=mcicda.drv

The edited section should appears as follows:

      [mci]
      CDAudio=mcicda.drv
      CDAudio1=mcicda.drv1

This change enables drives that require the same driver, as well as those that
require different drivers.

When you run Media Player, you should have two entries in the devices menu. You
can select between the two entries to access your CD-ROM drives.
