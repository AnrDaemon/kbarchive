TITLE   :Klotski Uses Wrong Font Under Windows 3.1
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER:

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

The game Klotski (from the Microsoft Windows Entertainment Pack, Volume 3)
appears differently under Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 than it
does under Windows version 3.0. This difference is due to the font type Klotski
uses to display titles, and appears only after new TrueType fonts are
installed.

When new TrueType fonts have been installed, Klotski chooses a new font to use in
its titles. This font will be the font that is highest in alphabetical order.
This can produce very unpredictable titles, and usually is unreadable.

If the new font is then removed, Klotski then chooses the next font appearing in
alphabetical order.

This is a problem with Klotski, not Windows 3.1. The font that Klotski is
requesting is being supplied correctly. To work around this problem, remove all
"new" TrueType fonts.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.0 3.10 3.1 WEP True Type uninstalled un-installed uninstall
