SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows Paintbrush prints jagged fonts even when using TrueType fonts.
This problem also occurs in Windows version 3.0.

The printing of jagged fonts in Paintbrush occurs because a raster (or bitmap
image) processor is converting the fonts to a bitmap at screen resolution.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When using the Text (ABC) tool in Paintbrush, all letters that you type are
converted to a bitmap at screen resolution. This is done mainly so that all
drawing tools, including the Text tool, produce exactly the same type of image
for Paintbrush to work with (a bitmap); therefore, Paintbrush does not have to
worry about bitmap planes and text planes.

The bitmap conversion is done so that after you type text in the image,
Paintbrush can manipulate it like all other parts of the image. The disadvantage
of bitmap conversion is that text cannot have a greater resolution than the
screen resolution even when printed on a high resolution printer.

Paintbrush is a low-end painting application. To achieve high-quality text and
graphics, you can buy a third-party drawing application similar to the Microsoft
Draw application that ships with Microsoft Word for Windows version 2.0.
