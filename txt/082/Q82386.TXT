SUMMARY
=======

Borland Turbo Pascal Version 6.0 is compatible with Microsoft Windows when
Windows runs under the conditions recommended by Borland.

MORE INFORMATION
================

According to "Borland Language Express," a technical support journal for Borland
products, the following procedures should be implemented for running Borland
Turbo Pascal 6.0 under Microsoft Windows versions 3.0 and 3.1:

1. Use a PIF file to start Turbo Pascal running in a full screen.

2. If MS-DOS version 5.0 memory drivers are being used, add the RAM parameter to
   the EMM386 device statement as follows:

   device=emm386.exe ram

3. Use the -x- option with the Turbo IDE (independent development environment)
   if EMS memory is not available.

4. For mouse support, load the mouse driver from MS-DOS in the AUTOEXEC.BAT or
   CONFIG.SYS file.

NOTE: The status bar in Turbo Pascal for Windows does not repaint properly when
run under the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1.


The Borland products included here are manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
