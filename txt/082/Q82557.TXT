Quick Menus (StartWQM.EXE), which comes with MakerPro for Windows, does not work
correctly with the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1. This problem
has been corrected in the latest version (4.0) of MakerPro for Windows.

MakerPro for Windows comes with StartWQM.EXE, which when added to the "Load="
line in WIN.INI, will attach a menu to any window that becomes the currently
active window.
