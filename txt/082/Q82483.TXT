SYMPTOMS
========

If you run Lotus 1-2-3 release 3.1 in standard mode with a limulator installed,
Lotus fails with the message:

   Virtual Machine (VM) error 19

It may be necessary to clear the "Close Windows on Exit" check box in the program
information file (PIF) to see this message.

CAUSE
=====

Applications that include their own MS-DOS extenders often have problems running
with Microsoft Windows version 3.1 in standard mode with a limulator. Lotus
1-2-3 version 3.1 is such an application.

An MS-DOS extender allows applications to access more than one megabyte (MB) of
memory on IBM-compatible machines.

On example of a limulator is EMM386.EXE included with Windows 3.1.

RESOLUTION
==========

To properly run applications that have their own MS-DOS extenders, do one of the
following:

 - Remove the limulator.

   -or-

 - Run the application in enhanced mode.
