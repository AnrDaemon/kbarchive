======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the Microsoft InPort (BUS) mouse on IRQ2 in Microsoft Windows has
reportedly caused the mouse not to function correctly in both standard and
enhanced modes on some systems.

CAUSE
=====

This may be due to an interrupt conflict. IRQ2 also cascades to the second Intel
8259 PIC chip. By default, these boards are set to IRQ2.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, change the IRQ to an open IRQ. IRQ 5 is usually free on
AT class machines (except the original IBM AT).

Additional query words: 3.10 3.1 3.11
