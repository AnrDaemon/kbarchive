SUMMARY
=======

If you run Central Point Backup version 7.0 or 7.1 for MS-DOS under Windows
version 3.1, DMA buffer size may be too small. To increase the DMA buffer size,
add the following line to the SYSTEM.INI file under the [386Enh] section:

      DMABUFFERSIZE=18

You may need to experiment to find a value that works on your machine. A value in
the range of 18 to 64 should work correctly.

If you have problems running Central Point Backup when TrueType fonts are
enabled, increase the BUFFERS setting in the CONFIG.SYS file to at least 30.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some tape backup systems require that DMABUFFERSIZE be set to 64, which is what
Central Point recommends. The disadvantage of increasing the buffer size is that
increasing the DMA buffer size uses up conventional memory for all applications
running under Windows.

The Windows version of Central Point Backup does not require the increase in DMA
buffer size. If you are going to use a backup program under Windows, Microsoft
recommends you use a Windows backup program, such as the one that comes with PC
Tools.

Some tape backup systems may run successfully no matter what setting is used for
the DMA buffer size. Resetting the DMA buffer size will not enhance performance
on such systems, even though the DMA buffer message is displayed. For more
information about using Central Point Backup with such systems, contact Central
Point Software.
