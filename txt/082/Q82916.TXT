TITLE   :PC Win: Not Sorting Correctly Based on Subject Field
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Messages sorted based on the subject field do not sort correctly.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may be caused by multiple subject lines having the same first 128
characters.

Mail for Windows only caches the first 128 characters of the subject field.
Messages that have subject lines that are identical through the first 128
characters are then sorted based on date.

Additional query words: 3.00
