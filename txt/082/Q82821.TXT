The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 Registration Information
Editor (REGEDIT.EXE) can help to set up shell (for example, Program Manager) and
OLE information, but the only documentation for REGEDIT.EXE is in the Windows
Help files, REGEDIT.HLP and REGEDITV.HLP. This article describes the
command-line switches for REGEDIT.EXE.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Syntax for REGEDIT.EXE
----------------------

   REGEDIT [/v|-v] [/s|-s] <FILENAME>

<FILENAME>
----------

This is a .REG-formatted file, which can be produced with the Save Registration
File command in the File menu of REGEDIT.EXE in advanced mode.

[/v|-v]
-------

This switch opens REGEDIT.EXE in advanced mode, where the registration database
is displayed in a tree structure (similar to the tree window in Windows 3.1 File
Manager). Any part of the database can be edited.

[/s|-s]
-------

When a filename is specified on the command line, this switch is used to suppress
any informational dialog boxes that would normally be displayed. This is useful
when the Setup program for an application wants to execute REGEDIT.EXE with a
.REG file, but does not want the user to be confused by any dialog boxes that
are displayed.

Syntax for Switches
-------------------

Either "/" or "-" can be used to signify the optional switches. The switches can
be combined (for example, -vs) and be typed in either uppercase or lowercase.
Unrecognized switches are ignored.
