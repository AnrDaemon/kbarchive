SUMMARY
=======

Dr. Watson version 0.80 is a diagnostic tool that ships with Microsoft Windows
operating system version 3.1. Dr. Watson is not installed in the StartUp group
by default. To use Dr. Watson for help with troubleshooting general protection
(GP) faults, either add a Dr. Watson icon to the StartUp group, or add
DRWATSON.EXE to the LOAD= line in the WIN.INI file.

NOTE: Dr. Watson is included in Windows versions 3.1 and 3.11 and Windows for
Workgroups version 3.1. It is not included with Windows 3.0 or Windows for
Workgroups 3.11.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To maximize the information pertinent to Microsoft Product Support Services
(PSS) engineers the following section should be added to the WIN.INI file:

      [Dr. Watson]
      SkipInfo=Reg 32b Sta
      ShowInfo=Mod

The following explains the two above lines:

SkipInfo=Reg 32b Sta
--------------------

SkipInfo= prevents Dr. Watson from displaying some information. "Reg" is short
for "registers." "32b" is short for "32-bit registers." "Sta" is short for
"stacks." This helps to limit the size of the DRWATSON.LOG file.


ShowInfo=Mod
------------

ShowInfo= tells Dr. Watson to display information. "Mod" is short for "modules."

Including the modules section provides some additional information (such as the
*.DRV, *.DLL, *.FON, *.386, and *.EXE files that were running at the time of the
GP fault) that may help the PSS engineer discover the source of the GP
fault(s).
