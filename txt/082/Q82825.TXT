SUMMARY
=======

TrueType fonts can be embedded or packaged into a document and transported from
one machine to another that does not have the embedded font, and the embedded
fonts will be available for use. Thus, documents are fully portable across both
Apple Macintosh and MS-DOS-compatible computers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Only TrueType fonts that have the proper licensing bits set (that indicate the
font vendor has given permission for the font to be used as an embedded font)
can be embedded into a document. An application must have special support for
handling the embedding of TrueType fonts and their installation upon reaching
the destination system.

There are new APIs (application programming interfaces) with Windows 3.1 that an
application must call in order to embed a TrueType font into a document and in
order to install a TrueType font at the application level.
