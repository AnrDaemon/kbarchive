The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Some third-party, or independent software vendors (ISV), applications do not
function correctly in Microsoft Windows version 3.1 if they were installed with
an existing copy of Windows 3.0 on the hard drive and then Windows 3.10 was
installed into a separate directory.

Many applications modify the Windows WIN.INI file and other data files and copy
their own .INIs, .DLLs, EXEs and other files into the current WINDOWS or SYSTEM
directories when they install. The new installation of Windows isn't aware of
any of these modifications and may not be able to run the existing applications.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Follow these steps to solve the problem:

1. Back up your current Windows 3.0 directory and subdirectories (SYSTEM, MSAPPS
   and others).

2. Install Windows 3.1 into the same directory as Windows 3.0 in order to update
   the existing version of Windows to version 3.1.

   -or-

3. Reinstall third-party applications for the Windows 3.1 directory.

4. During the installation of these applications make sure that they use the
   same directories as were used in their original installation.

   For example, if Wingz was original installed in a directory called C:\WINGZ,
   then during the reinstallation choose that directory.
