The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

Under Microsoft Windows version 3.0, you can install the generic PostScript
Printer driver to use your printer's PostScript capabilities. Under Windows
version 3.1, you should install the specific model name of your printer.

The generic PostScript Printer driver still exists for those applications that
require this generic driver name to run properly with PostScript functionality.
However, you should only use the generic driver as a last resort. It doesn't
perform all operations as well as using the specific model for your printer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With version 3.5 of the generic PostScript driver (shipped with Windows 3.1),
any settings required for the print job need to be specified from Control Panel,
not from within the application you are printing from.
