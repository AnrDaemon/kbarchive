======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run Microsoft Windows on a Hewlett-Packard HP QS 16s machine (an older HP
Vectra model) with an HP mouse, the system may stop responding (hang) if you
move the mouse while playing a MIDI file.

CAUSE
=====

The mouse is not set up correctly for use with Windows.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do the following to ensure proper use of old HP mice:

 - Make sure the following line exists in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI
   file:

         device=HPEBIOS.386

   This is a special virtual device driver (VxD) required for old HP mice on
   older models of the HP Vectra.

 - An HP Windows mouse driver is also required in the [Boot] section of the
   SYSTEM.INI file. It should read as follows:

         mouse.drv=hpmouse.drv
