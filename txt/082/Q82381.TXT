SYMPTOMS

If you load SMARTDrive (SMARTDRV.EXE) from within a shell program such as
Program Manager, SMARTDrive may not be able to detect the shell and you may be
unable to properly exit the shell program.


RESOLUTION

You should not load SMARTDrive from within a shell program, such as Program
Manager. SMARTDRV.EXE has the ability to detect some shells, such as a Windows
MS-DOS virtual machine or the MS-DOS Shell, but there are many more that have
problems if SMARTDrive is loaded in them. Therefore, always load SMARTDrive
before running any shell programs.
