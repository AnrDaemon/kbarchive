KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

SUN PC-NFS is not directly supported by Windows 3.1. The Windows Setup program
detects it as NO NETWORK INSTALLED. SUN PC-NFS may work correctly with Windows
3.1 if you modify the SYSTEM.INI file as described in this article.

NOTE: Version 3.5C should be used for the modification. However, please note that
even with the modifications, PC-NFS is still not directly supported by Windows
3.1.

SYSTEM.INI
----------

Using a text editor, add the following line to the [386Enh] section of the
SYSTEM.INI file:

      UniqueDosPSP=True

MORE INFORMATION
================

Viewing and Connecting to Network Shares
----------------------------------------

With version 3.5C of PC-NFS, you cannot view a network printer queue from within
Print Manager. Also, you cannot connect or disconnect network drives from within
File Manager. You can still make the connection to a PC-NFS host server either
from MS-DOS before going into Windows or from an MS-DOS command prompt in
Windows.

Network connections made from an MS-DOS command prompt before entering Windows
appear as local drives in File Manager. The connections are accessible from File
Manager or any MS-DOS command prompt. You can disconnect the network drive from
an MS-DOS command prompt.

Network connections made from an MS-DOS command prompt in Windows are only
visible to that MS-DOS session. This network connection is not visible from File
Manager or from MS-DOS after you exit Windows.

3COM Interrupt Conflict
-----------------------

If you run Windows in 386 enhanced mode and have a 3COM board installed and
configured for IRQ3, the machine may hang or lock up when you try to access a
remote drive or printer. If a problem occurs, either use a different interrupt
setting on the network card, or run Windows in standard mode.

Swap and Temporary Files
------------------------

Any 386-enhanced mode swap files or standard mode temporary files should be
created on a local drive. The SYSTEM.INI settings and MS-DOS environment
variables listed below should NOT refer to a remote drive:

   Section of SYSTEM.INI         Setting
   -------------------------------------

   [386Enh]                      PagingFile=(path to a local drive)
   [NonWindowsApp]               SwapDisk=(path to a local drive)

   MS-DOS Environment Variable
   ---------------------------

   SET TEMP=(any directory that exists on a local drive)

PIFs for PC-NFS 3.5C Utilities
------------------------------

When creating a .PIF file for PC-NFS utilities in 386 enhanced mode, be sure to
use the Lock Application Memory In Advance option in the PIF editor. Failure to
do so may result in system crashes or data loss.
