SYMPTOMS
========

The PLUSDRV.SYS driver from the Plus Development Passport Hard Drive causes
Microsoft Windows version 3.1 to stop responding (hang) when SMARTDRV.EXE
version 4.0 with double buffering is activated in the CONFIG.SYS file. For
example:

      Device=C:\Windows\SMARTDRV.EXE /double_buffer

RESOLUTION
==========

Do the following to resolve the conflict:

1. Delete the

   SMARTDRV.EXE /double_buffer

   line from the CONFIG.SYS file (edit the CONFIG.SYS file using Notepad or
   Write).

2. Put the SMARTDRV.EXE line back in the CONFIG.SYS file but switch the order
   of

   SMARTDRV.EXE /double_buffer

   with the

   PLUSDRV.SYS

   device line.

3. Obtain the most recent revision of PLUSDRV.SYS (revision F) and retry the
   above steps.
