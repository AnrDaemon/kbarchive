SUMMARY
=======

Digital Communications Associates (DCA) IRMA 3270 Workstation for Windows
version 1.1 generates a general protection (GP) fault when running under
Microsoft Windows version 3.1 if any of the following conditions are true:

 - TTOnly=1 is in the [TrueType] section of the WIN.INI file.

 - You are using an IRMA 3270 Workstation for Windows version earlier than 1.1
   revision D.

 - You are using DCA IRMA Workstation for Windows QuickPad.

MORE INFORMATION
================

TTOnly=1 Is in the [TrueType] Section of WIN.INI
------------------------------------------------

If TTOnly=1 is in the [TrueType] section of the WIN.INI file, a general
protection (GP) fault occurs. This entry causes Windows to use only TrueType
fonts in Windows-based applications. IRMA 3270 Workstation for Windows, like
many other Windows-based 3270 programs, requires that its own fonts be used
because of its ability to scale multiple displayed sessions.

To correct this problem:

1. Run Control Panel and choose the Fonts icon.

2. Choose the TrueType button.

3. Clear the Show Only TrueType Fonts In Applications check box.

Using IRMA 3270 Workstation for Windows Earlier than 1.1 Revision D
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A GP fault occurs if you install a version of IRMA 3270 Workstation for Windows
earlier than 1.1 revision D and install Windows with the SETUP /N command.

This behavior occurs because IRMA automatically installs its fonts into the
SYSTEM subdirectory, which does not exist in a network installation of Windows.
Windows tries to load those fonts, and can't find them, causing the GP fault.

This is corrected in version 1.1 revision D of IRMA. A workaround is to copy the
fonts needed into the shared WINDOWS directory.

Using DCA IRMA Workstation for Windows QuickPad
-----------------------------------------------

There is a problem in the DCA Workstation for Windows QuickPad application that
results in a GP fault in Windows 3.1 and an Unrecoverable Application Error
(UAE) in Windows 3.0.

Contact DCA for information on the availability of upgrades for this program.
