SUMMARY
=======

If there is not enough free upper memory block (UMB) space for Banyan VINES
network software, it may overwrite the current CMOS settings. To work around
this problem, free up additional UMB space.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, if SMARTDrive (SMARTDRV.EXE) is loaded in upper memory, there may
not be enough UMB space for Banyan VINES. To work around this problem and avoid
Banyan VINES overwriting the CMOS settings, free up additional UMB space or load
Banyan VINES in conventional memory and use MS-DOS MemMaker to optimize the UMB
space.

For additional information, contact Banyan VINES.

Banyan VINES is manufactured by Banyan Systems, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
