TITLE   :Bad Font or Display with PC Tools Version 7.0 or 7.1
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run a PC Tools version 7.0 or 7.1 MS-DOS-based application in a window in
Microsoft Windows version 3.1, the display may look garbled or the font may not
display correctly. This can also happen in Windows in standard mode when you
switch to a PC Tools application.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the problem, start PC Tools applications by using the /NF, /NG,
or /NGM options. If PC Tools applications are included in a Program Manager
group, use the Properties command to add options to the command line.

You can also include the /NF option in the application's program information file
(PIF) by typing it in the Optional Parameters text box in the PIF Editor. You
can use the PC Tools PCCONFIG program to specify that PC Tools applications
should use the Text Font to display information.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
