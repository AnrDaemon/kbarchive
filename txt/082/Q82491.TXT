The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you upgrade to Microsoft Windows version 3.1 or 3.11 over Windows
3.0, the files SMARTDRV.SYS and EMM386.SYS are left in the Windows
directory. The current AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files are changed
to load the new SMARTDRV.EXE and EMM386.EXE files. A problem can arise
if you have multiple CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files that can load
these earlier .SYS files.

The earlier files can be safely deleted either from the MS-DOS prompt
or from the Windows File Manager. Any additional AUTOEXEC.BAT or
CONFIG.SYS files should also be edited to remove references to these
earlier Windows 3.0 files.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.1 3.11 upgrade
