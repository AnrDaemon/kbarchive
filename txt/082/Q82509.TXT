 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, file handles are shared in
standard mode. This can have a dramatic impact on software products, such as
database programs, that use a large number of file handles. The number of file
handles should be increased to at least 50 (for example, FILES=50 in the
CONFIG.SYS file).

A low number of file handles may result in only a limited number of applications
being able to run at the same time, poor performance, or becoming locked in a
DOS session.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, with FILES= set to a low number, from Program Manager, run an
MS-DOS database program that requires a large number of file handles; the
application's screen will briefly flash and then it will close again leaving a
minimized application at the bottom of the screen. This application can be
closed only by:

1. Clicking its icon to bring up its control menu.

2. Choosing Settings and then choosing the Terminate button.

This method will cause lost clusters to be left on the hard drive, and may cause
other problems.
