SUMMARY
=======

Under the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, the Charmap program
may incorrectly display Bitstream FaceLift fonts. This problem occurs with lower
point sizes (9 points and lower).

To correct this problem, the threshold of the Parameters setting in the FaceLift
control panel should be set lower.

The default FaceLift threshold for screen fonts is 9 points. FaceLift does not
display a font on the screen any smaller than this; therefore, the font in the
Character Map grid is incorrect. Larger point sizes are displayed correctly.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.11
