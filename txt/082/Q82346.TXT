The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SEGENTRY.DAT file is used for profiling purposes and is created by the
VPROD.386 device driver. It is created in the directory in which Windows is
started. This is why there may be multiple copies of this file on the hard
drive.

The device driver VPROD.386 is only needed when profiling. Removing the
DEVICE=<path>VPROD.386 line from the SYSTEM.INI file stops SEGENTRY.DAT
files from appearing everywhere Windows is started.

This information is documented in the Windows Software Development Kit
documentation.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.11
