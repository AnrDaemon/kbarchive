SUMMARY
=======

After upgrading from Windows 3.0 to the Microsoft Windows operating system
version 3.1, some printer device settings may not be retained.

As a general rule, Microsoft recommends that customers reset their printer device
mode settings via the Control Panel. To do this, select the Printers icon and
then choose the Setup button.


MORE INFORMATION
================

All dot matrix printer drivers will have their dialog boxes reset to the
default. Also, printer model types may differ; for example, printer models Epson
LQ 2550, Epson LX-810, and Epson LQ-510 will be upgraded as Epson LQ 2500, Epson
LX-800, and Epson LQ-500, respectively.

For PostScript and Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet printers, most settings will be
retained with the exceptions listed below:

For all HP LaserJet and all PostScript printer drivers, the previous
printer-memory settings, defined in Control Panel under the Printers icon,
(choose Configure, then choose Setup,) will be returned to the default value.
