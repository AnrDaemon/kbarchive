The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, depending on the
memory available, it is possible to drag and drop a file from File Manager into
Write or Cardfile, resulting in a blank Packager object. This problem is most
likely to occur under low memory situations when large files are being
transferred. Closing down other applications and freeing up memory in general
will solve this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
