======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

When the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 is exited, the
SoundBlaster Pro card sometimes emits a screeching noise.

The noise can be temporarily stopped by running the FMOrgan program that comes
with the SoundBlaster card. FMOrgan is an MS-DOS application utilizing the
synthesizer that comes with the SoundBlaster card.

To ensure proper use of the SoundBlaster Pro card, do not use the Ad Lib driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The noise is caused by setting the Ad Lib chip into "Wave-Select" mode.


The Ad Lib driver will set the synthesizer in Wave-Select mode each time a
"warm-reset" is issued. This occurs each time the Ad Lib driver is enabled and
opened. On some machines (Gateway 486/33 with the SoundBlaster Pro), the Ad Lib
chip causes random voices to make noise.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
or reliability.
