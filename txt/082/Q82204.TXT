-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows version 3.1 or 3.11 may return the following error message:

   Group File Error
   Cannot Open Program Group File <xxxx>.GRP
   Do you want Program Manager to try and load it in the future?

At this point, a Yes/No option box appears.

In Windows 3.0, the error message appears as follows:

   Group File Error
   Cannot Open Program Group File

With both versions, the message occurs if a program group listed in the [Groups]
section of the PROGMAN.INI does not have a corresponding *.GRP in the specified
path, or if the file is corrupted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 3.1
-----------

If you choose Yes, Windows attempts to load the .GRP file during the next boot.

If you select the No option, Windows modifies the PROGMAN.INI file by deleting
the line that referenced the corrupt .GRP file.

NOTE: If you prefer, you can use any text editor to edit the PROGMAN.INI file,
rather than allowing Windows to modify it automatically.

If you have moved the group, you should be sure to add a correct reference to
PROGMAN.INI.

For example, if the PROGMAN.INI reads as follows

      [Groups]
      Group1=D:\WIN31\NONWINDO.GRP
      Group2=D:\WIN31\GAMES.GRP
      Group3=D:\WIN31\ACCESSOR.GRP
      Group4=D:\WIN31\MAIN.GRP
      Group5=D:\WIN31\WindowsA.GRP
      Group6=D:\WIN31\OTHER.GRP

and you have moved the OTHER.GRP file to E:\WIN31, Windows displays the following
error message:

   Cannot Open Program Group File D:\WIN31\OTHER.GRP

To correct the problem, add the following line to the PROGMAN.INI:

        Group6=E:\WIN31\OTHER.GRP

Windows 3.0
-----------

In Windows 3.0, the automatic update option is unavailable. You must manually
update PROGMAN.INI to change or eliminate any erroneous .GRP references.
