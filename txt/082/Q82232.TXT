TITLE   :CopyMetaFile() Creates Incorrectly Sized Destination

SUMMARY
=======

When an application calls CopyMetaFile() to create a copy of a metafile, the
size of the metafile is listed incorrectly in the destination metafile. The
destination size is three words larger than the source metafile.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The debugging version of Windows 3.1 contains code to validate the size of a
memory metafile. This code walks through every record in a metafile and computes
the total size. The code compares the computed size with the size listed in the
header. If the sizes do not match, the debugging version of Windows displays the
following message:

   Metafile has incorrect size

In most cases, this message indicates a corrupted or incorrectly formed metafile.
However, this message is also generated as a result of copying an existing
metafile due to the problem detailed above.

NOTE: By itself, the "metafile has incorrect size" message is harmless and can be
safely ignored. However, under certain circumstances, the debugging version of
Windows will also display the following message:

   Metafile is not terminated properly

This message indicates a more serious problem because, as the validation code
walked through the array of metafile records, it did not locate a terminator
record. An attempt to play an improperly terminated metafile usually results in
a General Protection Fault (GP-Fault). To prevent this fault, GDI aborts the
call to PlayMetaFile and returns failure.
