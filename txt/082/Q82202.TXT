-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you run Microsoft Windows in real (3.0 only), standard, or 386 enhanced
mode with the US-International keyboard layout, the right ALT key functions
differently or not at all.

With the US-International keyboard layout, the right ALT key is remapped for
international functionality. The left ALT key can (and should) be used for
Windows commands.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To check the Windows keyboard layout, do the following:

1. From the Main group, choose the Control Panel icon.

2. Choose the International icon.

The international settings are displayed. In the Keyboard Layout box, check for
the US-International setting.

Problems with the right ALT key in Windows and the US-International keyboard
layout include:

 - Pressing ALT does not highlight the first menu on the menu bar.

 - Pressing ALT+SPACEBAR does not open the Control menu.

 - Press ALT+F4 does not bring up the Exit Windows dialog box.

 - Pressing ALT+ESC brings up the Task List instead of cycling through the open
   application windows and icons.

 - Pressing ALT+ENTER (in 386 enhanced mode only) switches an MS-DOS application
   between full screen and a window but does not switch the application from a
   window to full screen. Also, after you press the right ALT key and then press
   ENTER, the left ALT key and ENTER do not work.

If the US-International keyboard layout is used, the left ALT key functions
normally and can be used for Windows commands.
