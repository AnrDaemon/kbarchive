TITLE   :FORMAT May Allow Access to Unformatted Drives
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If, while attempting to format a fixed disk, you terminate the MS-DOS FORMAT
command by pressing N (No) at the

   Proceed with Format (Y/N)

message, MS-DOS may allow access to a fixed disk drive even if it has never been
properly formatted.

A drive accessed in this manner isn't stable for use with MS-DOS, and may report
large numbers of lost allocation units or other problems when you run the MS-DOS
CHKDSK command.

CAUSE
=====

Responding N to the "Proceed with Format (Y/N)?" message causes FORMAT to
incorrectly set the drive's SYSTEM (as reported by FDISK) to FAT12 or FAT16,
allowing access to the unformatted drive.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS versions 5.0, 5.0a, and
6.0. This problem was corrected in MS-DOS FORMAT version 6.2.

WORKAROUND
==========

To return the drive to its inaccessible status, simply reboot the machine. To
prepare the drive for use with MS-DOS, use the FORMAT command to format the
drive.
