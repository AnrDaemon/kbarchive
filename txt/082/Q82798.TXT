SUMMARY
=======

Under the Microsoft Windows version 3.1, mixing TrueType (TT) fonts and graphics
objects on the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet printer can cause inconsistent
results (that is, not true WYSIWYG). To get the printout to match the screen,
turn on Print TrueType As Graphics in the Printers Setup dialog box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

TT characters are downloaded to the HP LaserJet II and III series of printers by
default and are treated as device fonts. This dramatically increases the speed
of printing but can cause the printed output to not match the screen display in
certain situations.

In the most common situation, an opaque graphics object overlays TT text in the
document; on the screen the TT font does not show through the object, but on the
printout, it does. Another related problem concerns printing white TT fonts on a
shaded background; the HP LaserJet II series of printers can't do this, but the
HP III series can. Turning on Print TrueType as Graphics in the Printer Setup
dialog box corrects both of these problems but the print job takes longer to
complete.
