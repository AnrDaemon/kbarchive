======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When using mapping modes other than MM_TEXT and text alignment other than the
default (TOP-LEFT), device fonts may rotate in the opposite direction of
TrueType fonts and exhibit other strange behavior.

This may display on either the screen or printout when text is rotated. The text
may rotate the wrong direction on the screen, or rotate a different direction on
the printer.

CAUSE
=====

The incorrect rotation is due to the application's behavior, not to Windows
3.1.


Additional query words: 3.10 3.11 win31
