The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you are printing several jobs or using a printing macro that prints several
files on an Epson LQ-570, the printer may pause and stop printing. Microsoft
Windows returns the following message:

   Out of paper or not connected.

The Printer Pause light then blinks. If you select Retry, the message redisplays.
You can press the Cancel option to clear the message, and after several minutes,
you can select Retry to continue printing the same print job.

CAUSE
=====

The Epson LQ-570 is not designed to handle long print jobs. The printer's head
overheats and pauses. If Print Manager is not enabled, the printer goes off line
and takes some time to recover.

WORKAROUND
==========

No work around is available except to get a larger buffer installed on the
printer, which may help extend the time it retains a large spool file and may
keep most of the file printing.
