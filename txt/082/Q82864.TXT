MacInTax for Windows is very poor if the files are printed at a high
resolution.

Changing the printer resolution to the lowest possible setting may correct this
problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When printing at a high resolution from MacInTax for Windows, the printing
quality will be very poor. To correct this problem, change the printer
resolution to the lowest possible setting.

If you are printing with a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet series printer, be sure
to install the HP soft fonts when installing MacInTax. Then add the soft fonts
to Windows by running the Control Panel and choosing the Printers icon.

For HP LaserJet printers, the lowest resolution is 75 dots-per-inch (dpi).
