The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

AST Research has confirmed that loading MS-DOS 5.0 and later EMM386.EXE on an
AST Premium 286 computer with an AST 386 FastBoard upgrade may cause the
following error message on startup:

   EMM386 Privileged Operation Error #01
   Deactivate EMM386 and Continue(C) or reBoot(B):

CAUSE
=====

The AST 386 FastBoard is an 80386 upgrade for AST 80286 motherboards. This error
may occur if the 386 FastBoard driver FB386.SYS is not loaded before EMM386.EXE
in the CONFIG.SYS file.

WORKAROUND
==========

Loading the 386 FastBoard device driver, FB386.SYS, before EMM386.EXE in the
CONFIG.SYS file may correct the error. The following is an example of how the
drivers should be loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file:

   device=c:\fb386.sys
   device=c:\dos\himem.sys
   device=c:\dos\emm386.exe
