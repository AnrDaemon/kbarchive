The following are problems related to running the Microsoft Windows
version 3.1 tutorial with an EGA monitor:

 - Although Windows can be set up for an EGA resolution, the tutorial only
   supports a VGA or better monitor. If you attempt to run the tutorial by
   choosing Windows Tutorial from the Help menu on any monitor with a resolution
   lower than VGA, Windows displays the following message:

   A VGA (or better) monitor is required to run the tutorial.
   Press the ENTER key to exit.

 - If you set up Windows for a VGA or higher resolution, the Setup program asks
   you at the end of the setup process if you want to run or skip the tutorial.
   This option isn't offered if you select EGA resolution.

 - One of the new features of Windows 3.1 is the ability to automate the setup
   procedure by using the SETUP /H switch. One of the entries under the
   [Options] section in the *.SHH file is "tutorial" (without the quotation
   marks). This entry causes the tutorial to be launched at the end of the setup
   process. If this entry is added while setting up on an EGA system, the
   tutorial does not run and no error messages is displayed.
