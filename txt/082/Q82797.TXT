SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 does not require the VPICDA.386
patch for IRQ 2 problems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 3.0 is incompatible with some devices (most notably Novell network
cards) configured to use IRQ 2. To correct this problem, Windows 3.0 requires
VPICDA.386.

All changes made for VPICDA have been incorporated into the Windows 3.1 VPICD
device driver. Therefore, customers using VPICDA should update to the latest
VPICD device driver (which Setup will do by default).


Additional query words: 3.10 IRQ2 3.1
