SUMMARY
=======

Under Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, a number of applications
have problems with extended characters in filenames that "worked" under Windows
3.0.

The root of this problem involves the mapping of the extended ANSI set between
128-159 under Windows 3.1, which was NOT mapped under Windows 3.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The difference in mapping between 3.1 and 3.0 involves the characters in the
extended ANSI set between 128-159. Windows version 3.1 maps the extended
characters between 128-159, whereas Windows 3.0 does not. When a file is opened,
Windows assumes that the filename is an ANSI character string for the base ANSI
character set and a special conversion is made to address the extended character
set. Some applications also do the conversion themselves. If the conversion is
done twice, the file cannot be opened.


This extra character support is important for international interaction, as these
characters are fundamental characters in most European alphabets.

This problem has always occurred for the characters 160 and above. It is more
noticeable with Windows 3.1 due to the extensive use of the characters 128
through 159. However, removing this support from Windows 3.1 would only lessen
the occurrence of this problem, not solve it.
