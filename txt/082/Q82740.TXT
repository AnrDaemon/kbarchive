SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses some problems that may occur when running Microsoft Word
for MS-DOS under Microsoft Windows version 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When running Word for MS-DOS in graphics mode under Windows 3.1, the Word screen
can't be captured to the Clipboard by pressing PRINT SCREEN. To capture the
screen, Word must be running in text mode. This is a limitation of Windows 3.1,
not a problem with Word for MS-DOS.

The mouse pointer and cursor will be incorrectly drawn after switching from full
screen to windowed mode. To correct this, use the /Y parameter when loading the
MS-DOS level mouse driver.

On some machines, if you run Word for MS-DOS version 4.0 under Windows 3.1 in
standard mode, a key stroke may repeat infinitely after task switching. This
affects a limited number of machines, and can be fixed by upgrading to the
current version of Word.

After switching, Windows 3.1 loses track of the EGA line mode in applications
like Word for MS-DOS and Works for MS-DOS if they are run in other then 43 line
mode. To solve this problem, load the MS-DOS level EGA driver (EGA.SYS) supplied
with Windows 3.1.

When Word for MS-DOS version 4.0 is run in text mode and is windowed, the old
mouse (MS-DOS level) cursor will remain as a blot on the screen. This is only a
cosmetic problem, and will not affect performance. Currently there is no
workaround to this problem.
