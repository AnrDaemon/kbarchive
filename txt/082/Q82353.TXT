SYMPTOMS
========

If you use a Microsoft BallPoint Mouse on a laptop computer with a power-saving
suspend/resume function, the BallPoint mouse may behave erratically upon
resuming.

This problem occurs on laptop computers or other personal computers with a
suspend/resume function that includes powering down the PS/2 mouse port. The
computer suspends normally, but when it resumes, the BallPoint mouse cursor may
not move away from the left edge of the screen.

RESOLUTION
==========

In Windows 3.0, the BallPoint mouse support is provided through a virtual device
driver named BPVKD.386. To correct the problem, remove the BPVKD.386 virtual
device driver, thereby making the BallPoint an ordinary mouse.

In Windows 3.1 and 3.11, removing the BPVKD.386 does not resolve the problem
because the *vkd code for the BallPoint support is built into Windows. The only
way to correct this behavior is to obtain a PS/2 mouse port BIOS update.
