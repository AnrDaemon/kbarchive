SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, when an option under Monitor
Ports in the PIF (program information file) Editor is selected, Windows verifies
that the ports assigned to the display adapter are the same as those used by the
application. Selecting one of these options slows down the display and should
not be done unless there is a good reason. For the most part, only EGA systems
require the use of these settings.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Under Monitor Ports, there are three check boxes: Text, Low Graphics, and High
Graphics. Monitor Ports is off when all three check boxes are clear.

One of the Monitor Ports options should be used when switching away from an
application causes the display to become corrupted. These options are generally
used under the following conditions:

1. With some very old text-based applications, you may need to select the Text
   check box.

2. To run Lotus 1-2-3 version 1.0 in CGA mode, you must select the Low Graphics
   check box.

3. For many applications on EGA systems, you must select the High Graphics check
   box.
