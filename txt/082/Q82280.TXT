TITLE   :DOCERR: To Debug P-Code, TOOLS.INI Requires MODEL: Not MODEL=
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER::4.0,4.01
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for MS-DOS, versions 4.0, 4.01 
 - Microsoft CodeView for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.01 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the Microsoft CodeView Debugger version 4.0 or 4.01 to debug a p-code
application causes the following dialog box to appear:

         ------------------------Warning--------------------------
      |                                                         |
      |  program being debugged contains p-code but no 'model:' |
      |                  specified in tools                     |
      |                                                         |
      |---------------------------------------------------------|
      |                                        <OK>   <Help>    |
       ---------------------------------------------------------

Help advises that putting MODEL=<dllname> in the TOOLS.INI file (where
dllname is NMD1PCD.DLL for MS-DOS or NMW0PCD.DLL for Windows) will allow p- code
debugging. However, after following this advice, CodeView gives the warning:

   CV1056: cannot understand entry in 'tools.ini'
   "MODEL=<dllname>"

CAUSE
=====

Help should read "MODEL:<dllname>" not "MODEL=<dllname>".

RESOLUTION
==========

Follow the instructions for "CodeView Debugging P-Code" in the README under the
\C700 directory. It contains the correct MODEL entry in the TOOLS.INI file.

Note that the path in DETAILS.TXT is relative to where C 7.0 is installed. Also
note that the tag for p-code debugging for MS-DOS is [cv] and the tag for
Windows is [cvw]. The following is a sample TOOLS.INI entry for p-code
debugging.

   [cv] MODEL:C:\C700\BIN\NMD1PCD.DLL

   [cvw] MODEL:C:\C700\BIN\NMW0PCD.DLL
