KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your computer stops (locks up or hangs) when you run Artisoft's Alone program
and Microsoft Windows with SMARTDrive loaded, and you try to copy files between
workstations and servers.

Several copy operations may be successful, but eventually a copy operation causes
the computer to hang.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because of the way Alone uses internal stacks. Alone does
not monitor its use of stacks and eventually fills them up completely.

RESOLUTION
==========

Don't run the Alone program. Alone is not required for full functionality on
Lantastic networks.

Disabling SMARTDrive write-behind caching on shared drives also corrects this
problem.


MORE INFORMATION
================

plan to use the machine as both a server and a workstation. Alone is a server
monitor that displays a screen of information that let's you check the activity
on the machine.
