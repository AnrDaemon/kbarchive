The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to run Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.0 from inside
Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, but only in real mode. To do
this safely and efficiently, create a program information file (PIF) that sets
up the memory requirements for real mode Windows and runs a batch file that
removes Windows 3.1 from the PATH environment variable in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The optimal memory configuration for Windows 3.0 real mode is as follows:

   XMS memory required: 512K
   XMS memory desired : 512K

   EMS memory required: 1024K
   EMS memory desired : 2048K

Windows 3.1 must be removed from the PATH environment variable to ensure that no
version 3.1 drivers or dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) will be loaded by Windows
3.0.

The PIF file should have a batch file as the executable filename. The batch file
should at least have the following lines

   ...SET PATH=C:\WIN30
   ...C:
   ...CD\WIN30
   ...WIN /R

where "WIN30" is your Windows 3.0 program directory and C is the drive that
contains Windows 3.0.

Note: If the Windows 3.1 directory is on a drive other than C, it is critical to
have the line "C:" in the batch file (where C is the drive that contains Windows
3.0).
