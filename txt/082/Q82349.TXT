SYMPTOMS
========

If you open an MS-DOS virtual machine (VM) while debugging under version 3.07 or
4.0 of Microsoft CodeView for Windows, the keyboard locks up when you close the
application being debugged. This occurs under most configurations. Attempting to
exit CodeView using the mouse causes Microsoft Windows to stop (hang or crash).

WORKAROUND
==========

There are two workarounds to this problem:

 - If you exit CodeView for Windows before closing the application, the system
   should not hang.

   -or-

 - Do not open an MS-DOS command line in a window while running under CodeView.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in CodeView for Windows, versions
3.07 and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
as it becomes available.
