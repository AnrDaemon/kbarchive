SUMMARY
=======

When an application calls the DeviceCapabilities() API with the nIndex parameter
set to DC_BINNAMES, 24 bytes are required for each bin name.

DeviceCapabilities() returns the name of each bin as a null-terminated string in
a character array. Each bin-name entry requires 24 bytes and begins on the
[(n-1) * 24] byte of the array.

The following code demonstrates how to allocate a block of memory, retrieve the
bin names, and walk through the array of bin names. The code assumes that
GetProcAddress() has been used to retrieve a long pointer to the
DeviceCapabilities() in the printer driver and that the pointer was stored in
the lpfnDevCap variable:

      if ((dwDMSize = (*lpfnDevCap)(lpszDevice, lpszPort, DC_BINNAMES,

                                    0L, lpDevMode))
           && (dwDMSize != (DWORD)(-1)))

      {

         if (hMem = GlobalAlloc(GMEM_MOVEABLE, (WORD)dwDMSize * 24))
         {
            lpMem = (LPINT)GlobalLock(hMem);
            nBins = (WORD)(*lpfnDevCap)(lpszDevice, lpszPort,
                                        DC_BINNAMES, lpMem, lpDevMode);
            for (lpBins = lpMem, i = 0; i < nBins; i++, lpBins += 24)
            {
               // lpBins points to the null-terminated bin name.
            }
            GlobalUnlock(hMem);
            GlobalFree(hMem);
         }

      }
