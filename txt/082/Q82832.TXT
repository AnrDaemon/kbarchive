======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The WinSpeed version 1.0 and 1.02 installation program, INSTALL.EXE, does not
work properly with the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1. The
WinSpeed installation program copies an incompatible version of the SETUP.INF
file to the WINDOWS directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================


Updating to Windows 3.1
-----------------------


Symptom: When using applications such as Write and typing large TrueType fonts
very quickly, the screen does not repaint correctly.

Solution: Call Panacea to obtain an updated version of WinSpeed, then upgrade the
files.

Installing Under Windows 3.1
----------------------------

To install WinSpeed for use with Windows version 3.1, obtain an updated version
of WinSpeed from Panacea.

If INSTALL.EXE has already been used to install the WinSpeed drivers under
Windows 3.1, the following message will appear when trying to run Windows Setup
from the Main group:

   The SETUP.INF file on your system is not valid for use with this version of
   Setup.

To correct this problem, do the following:

1. Delete the SETUP.INF file from the WINDOWS directory.

2. The 3.1 SETUP.INF file should still reside in your WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.
   If it does not, copy the SETUP.INF file on Windows Disk 1 to your
   WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

This will restore the Windows 3.1 setup files to their normal state.

For additional information, please contact Panacea Inc. at (603) 437-5022.
