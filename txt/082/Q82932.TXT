======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
 - Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API), used with:
    - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
    - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In an application for the Microsoft Windows graphical environment that uses a
mapping mode other than MM_TEXT and a text alignment other than the default
(TA_LEFT, TA_TOP), device fonts and TrueType fonts rotate in the opposite
directions. Device fonts may exhibit other unusual behaviors. Differences in
rotated text may appear on the screen or in printed output.

RESOLUTION
==========

To create a font that rotates based on the coordinate system in which the font
is used, the application must set the CLIP_LH_ANGLES (0x10) bit in the
lfClipPrecision field of the LOGFONT data structure. This technique is
backward-compatible with Windows 3.0 because the CLIP_LH_ANGLES bit is ignored
in version 3.0.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
