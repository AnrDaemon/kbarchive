The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Windows Setup program does not modify CONFIG.SYS if the HardCard
Plus device driver ATDOSXL.SYS is loaded. ATDOSXL.SYS is a device driver used by
HardCard Plus to make the card function as a drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Setup scans the CONFIG.SYS, and if it finds the text string "ATDOSXL.SYS"
(without the quotation marks), it does not modify CONFIG.SYS. Instead, it writes
the proposed changes to the file CONFIG.WIN in the Windows directory. If the
file CONFIG.WIN already exists, Setup creates the file CONFIG.nnn, where "nnn"
is the first numeric extension not already used, starting with the extension
"001" (for example, CONFIG.001, CONFIG.002, and so on).

Setup does not make changes directly to the CONFIG.SYS file, so Setup avoids the
possibility of trying to load a device driver from the HardCard drive before the
system has access to that drive.

The CONFIG.SYS file should be manually edited to include the changes recommended
by Windows 3.1 in the CONFIG.WIN file.
