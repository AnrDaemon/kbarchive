TITLE   :Error Message When Installing Roland MIDI Devices

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install either the Roland LAPC1 or Roland MPU-401 driver from the
Microsoft Windows Control Panel, the following message is generated:

   Roland MPU-401

   A configuration problem has occurred. Use the drivers option in the Control
   Panel to reconfigure the MPU-401 driver.

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs because the current settings for the Roland device are
incorrect (you haven't had a chance to set them yet).

This message only appears when either the PORT or IRQ for the Roland device is
incorrect. After correctly setting them, you will no longer see the message.

RESOLUTION
==========

Ignore this message during first installation and choose the OK button to
correctly set the PORT and IRQ settings for the device.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are separate entries for the Roland MPU-401 and the Roland LAPC1 in the
dialog box that appears when you select the Drivers icon from the Control Panel,
but they actually use the same Windows device driver.

The Roland LAPC1 is comprised of a Roland MPU-401 and a Roland MT-32. Access to
the LAPC1 is provided using the MPU-401. When installing the Windows driver for
the LAPC1, the error message is the same as for the MPU-401 because this message
comes from the Windows device driver MPU401.DRV.

The Roland MPU-401 is a port; it provides similar services as a serial port.
