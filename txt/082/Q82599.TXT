SUMMARY
=======

The following process causes the mouse to be invisible during the installation

2. From Program Manager or File Manager, choose Run from the File menu.

3. With Hollywood Disk 1 in drive A, type the following and press ENTER:

   a:install

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior occurs because the Blank Pointer option in Idlewild is set.


If Blank Pointer is set, Idlewild automatically hides the mouse cursor after a
few seconds (that is, before the screen saver starts).
