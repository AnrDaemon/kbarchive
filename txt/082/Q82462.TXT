WindowsTools File List Boxes Are Empty
--------------------------------------

WindowsTools by Gedy consists of four utilities. Two of these, HexEdit and
MultiCopy, have list boxes that display directories and files. With Windows 3.1,
the text list boxes are blank. If the area where the text should be visible is
selected with a mouse, the current directory and filename display properly.


WindowsTools Produces GP Fault Initiating a Text Search
-------------------------------------------------------

After installing WindowsTools File Management, selecting the TextSearch icon
results in the following error message:

   TXSEARCH has caused a GPF in txsearch.exe at 000B:069B

For more information about this problem, contact Gedy.
