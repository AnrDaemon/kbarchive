SUMMARY
=======

If your system hangs while rebooting after installing Windows 3.1 or a Windows
application, the MS-DOS path may be too long. Windows and Windows applications
frequently add their directory to the path. Under some versions of MS-DOS, such
as MS-DOS 4.01 or Compaq DOS 3.31, a PATH statement longer than 127 characters
can cause the system to lock up during system startup.

If this problem occurs, either start the computer by booting from a system disk
in drive A, or press CTRL+C (or CTRL+BREAK) before the PATH statement is reached
in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the path is very close to 127 characters, and the current Windows directory
entry in the path is not preceded with the drive designation (for example,
PATH=\DOS;\WINDOWS;...), Windows will add the C: to the Windows directory entry
in the path.
