SUMMARY
=======

TrueType font characters may run into each other on the display in AmiPro 2.0
and other applications. Turn off the application's Display As Printed option and
the spacing problems should be resolved. In AmiPro 2.0, the switch is in the
View Preferences dialog box under the View menu, and is called Display as
Printed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem is sometimes referred to as a "kerning" problem because it appears
as though the application is kerning the text too tightly.

Many applications format the document for a printer and then scale it to fit on
the display. With TrueType fonts, Windows has much more information about the
characters in a font and can space them closer together. The combination of
tighter spacing and scaling from a printer to the screen can cause TrueType
characters to touch each other on the screen but print correctly. A solution to
the problem is to tell the application to use screen spacing on the screen, and
printer spacing on the printer.
