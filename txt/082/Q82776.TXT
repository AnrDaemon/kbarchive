-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In a few rare circumstances, when Setup attempts to switch from the MS-
DOS-character portion of Setup to the graphical-mode Windows portion of the
installation, the hourglass cursor may disappear and Setup will stop responding
(hang) or Windows will exit to MS-DOS.

CAUSE
=====

This may indicate a corrupt SETUP.INF or SETUP.EXE file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To troubleshoot this problem:

1. Change to the Windows directory and delete SETUP.EXE.

2. Change to the Windows\System directory and delete SETUP.INF (and SETUP.EXE if
   a copy is there).

3. Clean the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files of any TSR
   (terminate-and-stay-resident) programs by using an ASCII text editor and
   inserting "REM" (without the quotation marks) and a space in front of TSR
   lines. For example:

   REM share.exe

   Save the file and restart the computer.

4. Use the MS-DOS CHKDSK command on the Windows floppy disks:

   chkdsk a:

   If errors are found, then the disk has been damaged.

5. Compare the files on the Setup disk with another copy of the Setup disk. If
   the number of files or number of free bytes do not match, then the disk has
   been damaged.
