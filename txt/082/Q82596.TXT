SCHECK.COM from STAC Electronics's Stacker version 1.0 is not compatible with
SMARTDRV.EXE version 4.0 that comes with Microsoft Windows operating system
version 3.1.

If SCHECK is used with SMARTDRV.EXE loaded, the following error message appears:

   Error Summary

   Unable to determine drive containing STACVOL.000 (This may be due to a disk
   caching utility which is installed in CONFIG.SYS after STACKER.COM.

There are three solutions for this error:

 - Upgrade to Stacker version 2.0 which SMARTDRV.EXE is "aware" of.

 - Run SCHECK before loading SMARTDRV.EXE.
