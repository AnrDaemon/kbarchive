======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SMARTDrive (SMARTDRV.EXE) version 4.0 might be detected by some virus detectors
as a virus.

CAUSE
=====

This is because of the manner in which SMARTDRV.EXE interacts with the operating
system.

WORKAROUND
==========

Remove SMARTDRV.EXE before running the virus scanner. In this case, remove
SMARTDRV.EXE from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, reboot the computer, and run the virus
detector. Afterwards, SMARTDRV.EXE can be added back to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
If you are running virus detection from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, make sure that
the virus detection software is run before SMARTDRV.EXE is loaded.
