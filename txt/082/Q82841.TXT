SUMMARY
=======

When the IBM PC3270 for Windows version 2.0 (2.01 with Corrective Service
Diskette) is used with Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, the
following problems occur:

 - During installation, the Setup gauge or progress bar is missing. This bar
   shows how much of setup has been completed.

 - When attempting to configure or reconfigure the application, the File and
   Directory boxes are not displayed correctly.

There is no solution to problem 1. Problem 2 can be worked around by supplying
the full path description to the existing configuration file in the File and
Open box.

The PC3270 is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
