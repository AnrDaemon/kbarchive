SUMMARY
=======

Using the Microsoft FORTRAN version 5.1 dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) for
Windows causes a general protection (GP) fault when the read or write statement
is called in binary mode while running FORTRAN under Windows version 3.1.


You may also receive GP faults when running programs written using the FORTRAN
5.1 compiler, if the following line is in the FORTRAN definitions file:
"APPLOADER __MSLANGLOAD". This line is for a special loading module designed for
programs that have static data items larger than 64K running in Windows 3.0.
Removing or remarking out this line solves the GP faults in Windows 3.1.

Note: If this is done on a Windows 3.0 system, the program no longer runs
correctly.

If the problem still continues, contact Microsoft PSS Language Support at (425)
635-7015.
