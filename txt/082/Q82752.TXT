SUMMARY
=======

If you use the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 with the
PSCRIPT.DRV version 3.5, there is no limit on the number of PostScript soft
fonts you can install. The only limit is the size of the WIN.INI file, which is
64K. (The useful size is approximately 50K.)

The Windows 3.0 PostScript driver versions 3.3 and 3.4 require that the font
directory (which lists metrics for all installed fonts) fit in a 64K block of
memory. At approximately 170 entries, the directory would need to be larger than
64K.
