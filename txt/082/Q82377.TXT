The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Sometimes Borland's Turbo C++ may appear to stop (hang) when you install Turbo
C++ from Microsoft Windows File Manager; however, Turbo C++ is not hung. Resize
the open windows so that the Turbo C++ Setup application icon is visible. Setup
continues normally.

This also may apply to other Borland products using similar install engines.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some third-party products have a Setup program that looks for actions, in this
case an unnecessary WM_PAINT (to repaint the icon), that tell Setup to continue.
Under Windows, WM_PAINT is not sent if the application's icon does not need to
be repainted, as when it is covered by other windows.

Make sure the icon (created by double-clicking the Setup program in File Manager)
is exposed. Move the icon, or resize any obscuring windows, and Setup continues
as expected.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
or reliability.
