======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you make an .EXE file under Visual Basic, Visual Basic asks you for the
filename and also lets you select which icon you want to use for this
application. Under Microsoft Windowsversion 3.1, it never displays the icon in
the Make EXE File dialog box. This makes it difficult to determine which icon to
use when making an application.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by a problem in Visual Basic.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the icon viewer provided with Visual Basic
called Icon Works. This application is a sample application that can be compiled
and run independently of Visual Basic to examine icons and show what they will
look like in the final program.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Visual Basic version 1.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.
