SUMMARY
=======

With the introduction of TrueType fonts, many characters have negative "a"
spacing. That is, these characters have an underhang such that a portion of
these characters is under the body of the preceding character. An example of
this is an italic "f". The bottom of the "f" is below the "i" in "if."

When the visible area of the window is not a complete rectangle (another
application's windows might be covering a corner of the window), the bottom of
the character that is supposed to be displayed to the left of the starting
position is chopped off. This effect is called a "complex clipping region."


MORE INFORMATION
================

To view this, do the following:

1. Open Write and maximize it.

2. Open up Clock and choose "Always On Top."

3. Return to Write. The window will now have a complex clipping region because
   of Clock's window being on top of it.

4. Choose Times New Roman Italic, 36 point, and type in "f" (without the
   quotation marks). Note that the bottom left of the "f" is clipped off. This
   doesn't happen if the clock isn't on top.
