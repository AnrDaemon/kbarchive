======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under Microsoft Windows version 3.1, a general protection (GP) fault can occur
when you print with the HPPCL5A printer driver and use Adobe Type Manager (ATM)
and Carbon Copy for Windows simultaneously.


CAUSE
=====

Carbon Copy for Windows alters the SYSTEM.INI file, inserting its own display
driver as follows:

   [boot]
   display.drv=CCVGA.DRV

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem, do one of the following:

 - Remove the CCVGA.DRV driver and replace it with a Windows 3.1 driver.

 - Print using a driver other than HPPCL5A.DRV.
