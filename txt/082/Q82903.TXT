SUMMARY
=======

Windows 3.1 provides the DisplayDib function to display a 256-color bitmap image
on a standard (16 color) VGA display. DisplayDib reduces the display resolution
to 320x200 or 320x240 and centers the bitmap on the screen, clipping the image
as necessary.

DisplayDib was first provided by the Multimedia Extensions to Windows version
1.0. It has been tested with, and is supported by, Window 3.1.

DISPDIB is a file in the Microsoft Download Center that contains a dynamic-link
library (DLL) with the executable code for the DisplayDib function. DISPDIB also
includes a header file and an import library file.
