-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

If you use the MS-DOS device driver DRIVER.SYS to create a logical floppy drive,
you may encounter problems accessing both the logical drive as well as the
physical drive it represents from Microsoft Windows, especially from File
Manager.

Some problems that you may be encountered are:

 - Drive letter(s) are not present in File Manager.

 - Drive letter(s) are present, but File Manager reports the drives do not exist
   when you attempt to access them.

 - MS-DOS error messages appear superimposed on the File Manager screen.

 - The system stops responding (hangs) when you access the drive(s).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MS-DOS device driver DRIVER.SYS can be used to create a logical drive
designator for a physical floppy disk drive. Drives configured in this manner
are not supported in the Windows environment and can lead to erratic floppy
drive and system behavior, particularly when the drives are accessed through
File Manager.

Do not use DRIVER.SYS to configure physical or logical floppy drives if you plan
to access those drives from the Windows environment.
