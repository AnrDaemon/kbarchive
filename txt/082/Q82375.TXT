The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you use the default parameters for SMARTDrive, Microsoft Windows does not
automatically start in enhanced mode on 386/486s with only 2 MB of memory. You
must either remove SMARTDrive (SMARTDRV.EXE) from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file or
reduce the cache size.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SMARTDrive defaults to a 256K cache size. This reduces the amount of extended
memory below what is required to automatically start Windows in enhanced mode.

NOTE: You can try to force Windows into enhanced mode even though memory is low
with this command:

   WIN /3

If you need more memory for Windows 3.1, change the settings of SMARTDrive in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The actual values needed vary depending on the device drivers
and TSRs being loaded from the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. A good
starting value to try is:

   Smartdrv.exe 256 128

The first value specifies the size of the cache when in MS-DOS, and the second
value specifies the size of the cache while Windows is running.

If this does not allow Windows to run in enhanced mode by default, lower the
second value until Windows starts in enhanced mode by default.

Before experimenting with SMARTDrive values, Microsoft recommends that you remark
out SMARTDrive (use the REM command), and ensure that Windows runs in enhanced
mode by default without SMARTDrive installed. To make these changes take effect,
reboot your computer.
