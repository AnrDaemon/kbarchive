The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Applications designed to use OLE in the Microsoft Windows operating system
version 3.1 may vary in user interface appearance.

These variations mainly occur in applications that were developed before a
complete user interface guide was available. Some applications do not support
full OLE implementation (server, client, linking, and embedding); this also
makes the OLE user interface differ in some cases.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some applications do not offer access to the commands on the Edit menu for the
objects that support multiple-name commands (such as Sound Recorder). Some
applications have the Insert Object command on the File menu instead of on the
Edit menu.
