-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You are using a Procom Technology SCSI disk driver, and the Microsoft Windows
Setup program stops responding (hangs) when checking the system configuration.

CAUSE
=====

Procom Technology's SCSI disk driver revision 1.3, September 1991, (filename:
SCSIDISK.SYS) causes this problem.

WORKAROUND
==========

Doing one of the following allows the Windows 3.1 Setup program to function
properly:

 - Comment (remark) out the SMARTDRV line in the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT
   file. (To do this, open the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file in a text editor
   and type REM at the beginning of the SMARTDRV line.)

   -or-

 - Comment (remark) out the DEVICE=SCSIDISK.SYS line in the CONFIG.SYS file. (To
   do this, open the CONFIG.SYS file in a text editor and type REM at the
   beginning of the DEVICE=SCSIDISK.SYS line.)

After Windows 3.1 Setup has completed, you can reactivate the commented-out line.
(To do this, open the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file in a text editor and
delete REM from the beginning of the line.)
