SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, MS-DOS-based applications and
Windows-based applications have to contend over the video palette. This may
cause the available palette to change. As a result, the colors on the screen may
change when you switch between MS-DOS-based applications and Windows-based
applications.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some 8514 video board configurations share their hardware video palette with the
pass-through VGA connector. In this case, it is possible for an MS- DOS-based
application running in an MS-DOS box to alter the color palette of Windows, and
vice versa. For example, running a palette-animation application in Windows and
then switching to an MS-DOS-based application (leaving the animation application
running in the background) can cause colors to change or "cycle" in some
MS-DOS-based applications.
