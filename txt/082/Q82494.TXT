SUMMARY
=======

Colored text does not print in shades of gray when using the Hewlett- Packard
(HP) PCL printer (HP LaserJet II series) drivers supplied with Microsoft
Windows. This feature is not supported. All color text prints in black. Printing
to a HP Laserjet 4/4M yields the same results.

This also applies to the HP laserjet III driver that ships with WFW 3.11. All
colored text will appear as black. If the "print text as graphics" box is
checked and there is any colored text on the slide, all the text will print as
white.
