SUMMARY
=======

Track 1 of the Multimedia Beethoven CD-ROM does not contain audio information.
When you play Multimedia Beethoven with the Media Player application,
MPLAYER.EXE, that shipped with Microsoft Windows, you need to start playing on
track 2.

To direct the Media Player to track 2, do the following:

1. Set the scale to Tracks.

2. Drag the scroll thumb to the second track.

3. Press the Play button.

MORE INFORMATION
================


Depending on the CD-ROM and device driver, you may get the following message:

      MCI Error: Hardware error on media device.

After receiving this error, you can advance the track scroll thumb to track 2 and
start playing Multimedia Beethoven again.

NOTE: Once playing has been successfully started on track 2 or a later track, it
may be difficult to scroll the track position. This only happens if the above
error occurs, and it depends on the particular configuration of the CD-ROM and
accompanying drivers.
