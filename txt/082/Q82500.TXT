When TAPCIS, an MS-DOS-based communications application used to access
CompuServe, is run in the background and is instructed to pause for a
finite amount of time, TAPCIS pauses eternally or until it is brought
to the foreground.

This can be corrected by creating a program information file (PIF) for
TAPCIS with the Detect Idle Time option turned on (the box is checked)
in the Advanced section of the PIF Editor.
