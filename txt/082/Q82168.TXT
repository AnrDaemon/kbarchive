TITLE   :PRB: "Orphan" Metafiles Not Tracked by Debugging Windows

SUMMARY
=======

If an application fails to delete a GDI object (for example, a pen) before it
shuts down, the debugging version of Windows will write a warning message to the
debug terminal. However, the debugging version of Windows does not produce a
warning message if an application creates a metafile and does not delete it
before termination.

This behavior does not unduly constrain memory because metafiles are stored in
global memory and are freed automatically at application termination.

Additional query words: 3.10 no32bit
