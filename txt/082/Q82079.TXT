SUMMARY
=======

You can import graphics from CorelDRAW! into Windows Paintbrush by converting
them to a PCX file format from CorelDRAW!. The image's colors are not retained
when converted to the PCX format. Colors are converted to black and white.
However, you can do a screen dump in CorelDRAW, then paste the screen dump into
Paintbrush. This keeps the colors intact.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To paste a color image from CorelDRAW! into Paintbrush, use the following
steps:

1. Go into full-screen view in CorelDRAW!.

2. Press PRINT SCREEN to place the contents of the screen into Clipboard.

3. Run Paintbrush, and choose Zoom Out from the View menu.

4. Paste the image into Paintbrush. The image isn't visible at this point.

5. Click any tool and the image appears, although it may be distorted.

6. From the View menu, choose Zoom In. The image is normal size and in full
   color.

The edges of the image may have to be cleaned in Paintbrush if the image did not
fill the entire screen in CorelDRAW!.
