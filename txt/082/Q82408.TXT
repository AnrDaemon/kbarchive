SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the following changes that are made to your system files
by Norton Desktop for Windows versions 1.0 and 1.1:

 - SHELL= Setting Changed in SYSTEM.INI File

 - Device Drivers Installed in the SYSTEM.INI File

 - Changes to the AUTOEXEC.BAT File

MORE INFORMATION
================

SHELL= Setting Changed in SYSTEM.INI File
-----------------------------------------

Norton Desktop for Windows can be installed as a shell that replaces the Program
Manager of Windows. To do this, Norton Desktop modifies the [boot] section of
the SYSTEM.INI file. To temporarily disable Norton Desktop, edit the SYSTEM.INI
file in a text editor (such as Microsoft Windows Notepad), and change the line
shell=ndw.exe so that it reads "shell=progman.exe" (without the quotation
marks).

Device Drivers Installed in the SYSTEM.INI File
-----------------------------------------------

Norton Desktop for Windows installs three virtual device drivers (VFINTD, VDMADX,
and VNSS) in the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory and places the following four lines
in the [386enh] section of SYSTEM.INI:

      DEVICE=VFINTD.386
      DEVICE=VDMADX.386
      DEVICE=VNSS.386
      DMABufferSize=21

The following is an explanation of the lines in the [386enh] section of
SYSTEM.INI:

   Lines               Description
   -----               -----------

   DEVICE=VFINTD.386   Virtual Floppy Interrupt Device Driver

   DEVICE=VDMADX.386   Virtual direct memory access (DMA) Device
                       Driver (replaces the default VFINTD, VDMADX,
                       VNSS internal DMA device driver *vdmad)

   DEVICE=VNSS.386     Virtual Screen Saver Device Driver

   DMABufferSize=21    Sets amount of RAM reserved for buffered DMA
                       (default=16)

Removing or remarking out these lines causes Windows to exit to the command
prompt when you try to start Windows in 386 enhanced mode.

To remove Norton Desktop for Windows, you need to remove the three device= lines
mentioned above and add the following line to the [386Enh] section of the
SYSTEM.INI file:

      DEVICE=*vdmad

Changes to the AUTOEXEC.BAT File
--------------------------------

When you install Norton Desktop for Windows version 1.0 or 1.1, your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file may be modified. Toward the end of the installation the following choices
are given:

 - Make changes:

   The NDW directory will be added to the PATH variable. Erase Protect (EP) and
   IMAGE will be added as well.

 - Make changes later:

   Nothing is changed.

 - Make no changes:

   The Norton Desktop for Windows directory is added to the path. It is not added
   if the PATH has reached its limit of 128 characters.

   Some versions of Norton Desktop delete the 't' from batch file extension so
   the batch file will not run.

Norton Desktop for Windows is manufactured by Symantec Corporation, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this product's performance or reliability.
