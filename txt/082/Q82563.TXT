SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 may hang if it is run with an
older Logitech mouse driver (versions 5.0 and earlier). This problem will occur
when you are task switching from an MS-DOS box back to Windows.

The Logitech mouse driver that ships with Windows 3.1 should be used. You can
install it by running Setup from Windows or from the MS-DOS prompt.
