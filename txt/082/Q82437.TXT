The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To use Norton Desktop for Windows version 1.0 (NDW.EXE) as the shell for
Microsoft Windows (in other words, having the

   shell=ndw.exe

line in the SYSTEM.INI file), the root directory for Norton Desktop must be in
the PATH environment variable in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Norton Desktop is not in the PATH, then starting Windows results in an error
message and Program Manager is loaded as the shell. After this behavior occurs,
the following problems can occur when Program Manager is closed:

 - The computer stops with only the desktop displayed.

 - Windows exits without its final dialog box being displayed.

 - Exiting Program Manager with other applications running can cause the other
   programs to remain active until they are individually closed.

Norton Desktop for Windows usually installs itself in the PATH whether or not you
tell it to modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT. The above problems could result if you
decide to remove the directory or decide to make the necessary installation
changes later. Putting the Norton Desktop directory back in the PATH corrects
all the problems listed above.
