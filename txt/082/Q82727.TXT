SUMMARY
=======

Under Windows, HyperAccess 5, an MS-DOS communications application, may lock up
the system. The lock-ups are fairly consistent on any given system, but they
vary widely among different systems depending on the individual configuration.

MORE INFORMATION
================

These lock-ups can occur in Windows 3.0, Windows 3.1, and in MS-DOS outside of
Windows. One situation in which a lock-up may occur is when HyperAccess 5 tries
to recover from a COM port error (such as when a phone line is disconnected).
HyperAccess goes into a tight loop while looking at a COM port with interrupts
disabled and no provision for a time-out. This effectively hangs the machine.

HyperAccess 5 is manufactured by HyperAccess, vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
