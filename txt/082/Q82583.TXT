The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Sound Blaster cards should be used with the appropriate drivers, as listed
below. This information is based on the Digital Sound Processor (DSP) version of
the sound card you have.

Sound Blaster Cards
-------------------

   DSP     Windows Driver Description    Windows Driver
   ---     --------------------------    --------------

   1.x     Sound Blaster 1.0             SNDBLST.DRV
   2.x     Sound Blaster 1.5             SNDBLST2.DRV
   3.x*    Sound Blaster 1.5             SNDBLST2.DRV


Thunder Board users should install the Sound Blaster 1.5 driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

How to Determine the DSP Version
--------------------------------

The best way to tell which Sound Blaster card you have is to run the program
TEST-SBC.EXE (for the standard Sound Blaster) or TEST-SBP.EXE (for the Sound
Blaster Pro) that comes with the sound card. After verifying the port and
interrupt request line (IRQ) settings of your card, TEST-SBC and TEST-SBP will
display the DSP version.

Windows Drivers Messages
------------------------

You'll see these messages only when you configure the driver (that is, when you
set the port and IRQ).

If you try to load the Sound Blaster 1.5 driver on a system that has a Sound
Blaster board with DSP versions 1.x (run the TEST-SBC.EXE program that comes
with the card to find out what DSP you have), you'll get a message telling you
need an upgraded board to use this driver.

If you have a Sound Blaster Pro card (these have DSP versions 3.x), you'll be
able to use SNDBLST2.DRV, but you'll receive a warning message when setting the
port and IRQ saying that you should get drivers from Creative Labs, the maker of
Sound Blaster, when using a Sound Blaster Pro card.

If you have a Thunder Board, you'll receive a message stating that you should get
updated drivers from Media Vision.

Sound Blaster and Thunder Board are manufactured by vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
