TITLE   :IdleWild Loses all Screen Savers Except Blackness
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

If IdleWild is launched from a directory other than the one it is stored in,
only the Blackness screen saver may be displayed in the list of available screen
savers. This problem can occur with versions 3.0 and 3.1 of the Microsoft
Windows operating system.

MORE INFORMATION
================

IdleWild builds a list of all the screen savers it can find, adding them to its
list of screen savers. The first entry in this list is always Blackness, as this
screen saver is built into IdleWild and is not stored separately on the hard
drive. IdleWild then searches the current directory, looking for IdleWild screen
saver files (files with .IW extension). If IdleWild was started in a directory
with no screen saver files, it may display only the Blackness screen saver as
available.

Additional query words: 1.0 idle wild wep
