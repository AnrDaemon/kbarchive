SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses using OLE in Microsoft Windows operating system version
3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A linked object consists of the following items:

 - The presentation format of the object. This is the visual presentation of the
   object that you see in the document. The actual object is not stored in the
   document. For example, when you view a Microsoft Paintbrush picture in a
   document, you are not seeing the actual object.

 - The object class name of the application that can operate on the object
   (edit, play, and so forth). For example, the class name for Paintbrush is
   "Microsoft PaintBrush, 'Picture';".

 - The source file name and location (with a fully-qualified path, including a
   network server name if applicable). For example, C:\DATA\BOAT.BMP.

 - Information about the item (such as the part of the file that constitutes the
   object). For example, a cell range of an Excel spreadsheet.

File Size of Linked Objects
---------------------------

File size increase with linked objects because although linked objects have file
size savings over the embedded objects, they still increase the size of the
document they are linked into.
