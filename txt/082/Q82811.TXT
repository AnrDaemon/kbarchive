-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Additional screen savers can be added to Control Panel's Desktop dialog box list
by copying the screen saver files into the WINDOWS or WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.
(The files can be copied using File Manager.)

The Microsoft Windows Entertainment Pack's IdleWild screen savers will also be
added to the Desktop dialog box list provided that the system is configured
properly (see below).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Control Panel scans the WINDOWS and WINDOWS\SYSTEM directories for files with
the *.SCR extension. It also checks the header of each *.SCR file for a specific
code indicating that it is a Windows 3.1 compatible screen saver. If the screen
saver meets this criterion, its descriptive name will be listed in the Desktop
dialog box's Screen Saver list box.

For IdleWild screen savers to be listed in the Control Panel Desktop dialog box,
the following conditions must be met:

1. IWLIB.DLL must be in the same directory as the IdleWild screen saver files
   (*.IW).

2. The directory with IWLIB.DLL and the IdleWild screen savers must either be on
   the MS-DOS path (which is set in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file) or they must be
   located in the WINDOWS or WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

3. The file SCRNSAVE.SCR (provided with Windows 3.1) must be in the WINDOWS or
   WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.1 idle wild
