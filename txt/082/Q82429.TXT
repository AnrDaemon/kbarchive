SUMMARY
=======

No-Squint II is a cursor enhancement package by SkiSoft Publishing Corporation.
No-Squint II is a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program that has the
filename NOSQUINT.COM and date of 7-11-90.


When No-Squint II is loaded high (with MS-DOS version 5.0 or other memory
managers) and you want to reload or run the TSR NOSQUINT.COM to get the
information screen or to modify the hot key, improper and erratic cursor
behavior results.

It is recommended that No-Squint II be loaded low prior to running the Microsoft
Windows operating system version 3.1. The No-Squint TSR can then be run at any
time.

The product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance
or reliability.
