The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

According to the DR DOS version 6.0 user's guide, "[the DR DOS version of]
EMM386.SYS works with Windows 3.0 in real, standard, and enhanced modes." To run
Windows in standard mode, the switch /WINSTD should be added to the device line
for EMM386.SYS line in the CONFIG.SYS file.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Digital Research recommends using the DR DOS EMM386.SYS memory manager in place
of the HIMEM.SYS memory manager that is installed during the Microsoft Windows
operating system version 3.0 setup.

Microsoft has confirmed that Microsoft Windows version 3.0 will load in 386
enhanced mode while using the DR DOS 6.0 memory manager EMM386.SYS. The device
line in the CONFIG.SYS file will appear as follows:

   DEVICE=C:\DRDOS\EMM386.SYS

Windows standard mode requires the addition of the /WINSTD switch to the device
line as follows:

   DEVICE=C:\DRDOS\EMM386.SYS /WINSTD

This switch, according to the DR DOS user's guide, "forces compatibility with
Windows 3.0 in standard mode. Note that using /WINSTD will reduce the amount of
conventional memory available to applications because upper memory is
disabled."

If you attempt to load Windows in standard mode without the /WINSTD switch, the
following message is displayed:

   EMM386: Cannot let Windows run in standard mode as upper and/or EMS memory is
   in use. If standard mode is required, use the /WINSTD option of EMM386.
