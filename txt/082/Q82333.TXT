======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you change to True Color display drivers that support 16bpp (bits per
pixel) or greater color depth, the following error message may be displayed when
you start Microsoft Windows:

   Extremely Low On Memory: Not Enough memory to convert all the program icons

CAUSE
=====

The above error occurs because Program Manager does not have enough memory while
trying to convert the icons in a group from the previous color format (4bpp - 16
colors, or 8bpp - 256 colors) to the new color depth supported by the new
display driver.

When Program Manager runs out of memory, it stops converting icons. The icons
that have not yet been converted appear as black boxes.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can manually convert black icons by doing the following:

1. Choose the program item with a black icon.

2. From the File menu, choose Properties, or press ALT+ENTER.

3. Choose the OK button.

If you have abnormally large groups, you may have to split the group into two or
more separate groups to comply with the 64K limit for a Program Manager group.
The size restriction of 64K includes information for each program item,
including icon color information.

When you change from a 16 color display driver (4bpp such as VGA or super VGA) or
a 256 color (8bpp such as 8514 or v7vga) to a 16bpp or greater display card, the
groups must be smaller to accommodate the additional color information for each
program item.
