The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With Microsoft Windows versions 3.0 and 3.1, if the PCTOOLS environment variable
is not properly set before running one of the PC Tools tools, a general
protection (GP) fault will occur in that tool's .EXE file.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in PC Tools. Central Point Software,
the maker of PC Tools, is responsible for correcting this problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PC Tools relies on the PCTOOLS environment variable to run properly. PC Tools
uses this variable to locate its data files. If this variable is not specified
in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file or if there is too little environment space to set it,
PC Tools will not be able to run correctly.

PC Tools is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
