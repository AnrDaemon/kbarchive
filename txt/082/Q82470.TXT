SUMMARY
=======

If you can't hear any sounds after you install a new sound driver for Microsoft
Windows, follow the troubleshooting steps in this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Make sure the sound adapter works from MS-DOS.

   Most sound adapters come with self-diagnostics programs. Run one if present
   (for example, TEST-SBC.EXE or DIAGNOSE.EXE for Sound Blaster, TBTEST.EXE for
   Thunderboard).

2. Make sure that system sounds are enabled through the Control Panel.

   Run the Sounds application. If the system sounds are unavailable, the sound
   driver probably will need to be reinstalled. (Also note that MIDI-only
   adapters cannot play wave files, for example, MPU-401 and LAPC1.)

3. Make sure the wave files assigned to system events are present in the WINDOWS
   directory. If a Custom installation of Windows was used, you may have decided
   not to install the wave files. Check the WINDOWS directory for the following
   wave files:

   DING.WAV
   CHORD.WAV
   CHIMES.WAV
   TADA.WAV

   If these files are not present, they can be installed by running Windows Setup
   from the Main group. From the Options menu, choose Add/Remove Windows
   Components.

   Only .WAV files can be used for system sounds.
