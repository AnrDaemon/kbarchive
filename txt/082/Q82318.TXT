The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

Stack overflows can cause Microsoft Windows to stop responding (hang). If
Windows hangs intermittently, try adding the following line to the CONFIG.SYS
file:

      STACKS=9,256

MORE INFORMATION
================

The addition of the STACKS command line causes MS-DOS to reserve space for
hardware interrupt handling (rather than an application's stack). In general,
the default setting gives you more free memory; however, there are situations
when the hardware interrupt routines require more space. On IBM machines,
STACKS=0,0 is the default; on all other machines, STACKS=9,128 is the default.

One such situation is when you are running SMARTDrive (SMARTDRV.EXE) version 4.0
with certain network cards. Windows Setup should modify the CONFIG.SYS file
accordingly when Windows is installed if it detects a known problem
configuration.

If Windows is hanging or crashing, particularly if SMARTDRV.EXE 4.0 is running,
or a network is installed, try adding the STACKS command to the CONFIG.SYS file
and see if that corrects the problem.
