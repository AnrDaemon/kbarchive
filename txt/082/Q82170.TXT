SUMMARY
=======

Dlldlg.exe is a file in the Microsoft Software Library that demonstrates
creating a dialog box in a dynamic-link library (DLL). The DLL contains a
routine that calls the DialogBox function. After the user types some text into
an edit control in the dialog box and chooses the OK button, the routine calls
the MessageBox() function to display the text.

Because a DLL has only one instance, it is not necessary to call the
MakeProcInstance() function for the dialog box procedure. The DLLDLG sample
demonstrates this by specifying the dialog box procedure's name in the call to
the DialogBox() function.

The DialogBox() function uses the value of its hInstance parameter to locate the
dialog box's resource template. For this reason, the hInstance value must point
to the module that contains the template. For the DLLDLG sample, the hInstance
value passed to the DialogBox() function is the value of the hInstance parameter
passed to LibMain().
