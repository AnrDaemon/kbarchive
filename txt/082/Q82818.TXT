SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, the WIN.INI file's [desktop]
section contains an IconTitleFaceName switch that has no effect on OLE Packager
object titles. Packager uses only the MS Sans Serif 8-point font. If this font
is not installed on the system, Packager uses the next most similar font
(Arial).

The IconTitleFaceName WIN.INI switch affects icon titles only in Program Manager,
File Manager, and the Windows desktop.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.1 face
