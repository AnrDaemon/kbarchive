SUMMARY
=======

The "noclobber" and "rename" items in the [ini.upd.31] section of the SETUP.INF
are operators used to tell Setup to either rename a .INI entry or not to remove
(clobber) an existing .INI entry.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is a sample of the [ini.upd.31] section of the SETUP.INF:

   [ini.upd.31]
   ;
   ; File,section,Line to be removed,Line to be added,Optional operator
   ;
   system.ini,386Enh, "device=vpicda.386","device=*vpicd"
   system.ini,drivers,"midi4=adlib.drv",  "midi4=msadlib.drv",rename
   system.ini,386Enh, "keyboard=" ,       "keyboard=*vkd",    noclobber

The first line causes Setup to remove the line device=vpicda.386 from the
[386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI and add the line "device=*vpicd" to the same
section in SYSTEM.INI.

The second line causes Setup to replace the line "midi4=adlib.drv" with the line
"midi4=msadlib.drv." Note: the replacement is done only if the line to be
replaced exists; therefore, this has the effect of renaming.

The third line causes Setup to replace the line "keyboard=" with "keyboard=*vkd"
only if the line "keyboard=" does not exist in the [386Enh] section of
SYSTEM.INI.
