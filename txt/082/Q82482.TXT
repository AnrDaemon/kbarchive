The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you upgrade to Microsoft Windows version 3.1 or 3.11 from Windows version
3.0, the Fuji-Matrix printer driver is not updated. Consequently, problems may
arise if the version 3.0 Fuji-Matrix printer driver is run under Windows 3.1.

To resolve this problem, remove the printer driver via the Control Panel, and
reinstall the Windows 3.1 printer driver for either the 9- or 24-pin Fuji-Matrix
printer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Fuji-Matrix 3.0 version printer drivers are not guaranteed to run well under
Windows 3.1. The earlier Fuji-Matrix printer drivers contain both the 9- and
24-pin versions of the Fuji-Matrix printer in one driver. No specific
information pertaining to this is written in the WIN.INI file. Setup, therefore,
has no way of knowing which model to select.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
or reliability.
