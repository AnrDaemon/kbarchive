======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Norton Desktop for Windows' (NDW) DiskCopy copies slowly when used with
Microsoft Windows SMARTDrive (SMARTDRV.EXE) version 4.0. Using Windows 3.1 or
3.11, it may take more than twice as long to copy a disk as it does under
Windows 3.0.

CAUSE
=====

This slowdown occurs because NDW's DiskCopy uses disk access that is not optimal
for SMARTDrive 4.0.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem:

1. Edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file using a standard ASCII text editor such as Windows
   Notepad.

2. Modify the SMARTDRV.EXE line to disable the floppy cache

   C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE A- B- xxxx yyyy

   where "xxxx" refers to the SMARTDRV cache size at the MS-DOS level (before
   Windows starts). "yyyy" refers to the size of the cache after Windows
   starts.

   The sample line above disables the cache for both floppy drives (that is
   drives A and B). To disable caching on a drive, type the drive letter and a
   minus sign. For example, the following line disables caching on drive C:

   SMARTDRV.EXE C-
