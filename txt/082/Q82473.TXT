-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows 95

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

HyperKey, part of the HyperDisk SpeedKit, does not work properly in an MS-DOS
virtual machine (VM) under Microsoft Windows.

HyperKey can cause several problems in an MS-DOS VM:

 - Keystroke repeats may stop.

 - Keys pressed may display sporadically.

 - Sound may continuously play from Windows if a sound was playing just before
   switching to an MS-DOS VM.

CAUSE
=====

HyperKey is explicitly documented as not being compatible with Windows. Page 5
of the HyperKey manual states the following:

   When Microsoft Windows is active, a device driver such as HyperKey cannot
   intercept keystrokes. Therefore, HyperKey is inoperative in the Windows
   environment.

WORKAROUND
==========

If these problems occur, remove HyperKey from the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT
file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

HyperKey is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no

reliability.
