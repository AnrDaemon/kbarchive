SUMMARY
=======

If you are running Xerox Ventura Publisher version 3.0 while on a network with
Windows version 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 and a second
workstation tries to start Ventura, then the following error message is
displayed at the second workstation:

   VPKbnetwork.DLL

   Failure - too many users

Ventura is installed on the local workstation hard drives. Choose the OK button
and the following error message is displayed:

   Error in attempting to load VP.SER Network Admin. File.

Any action shuts down Ventura. If you do not start the network, then Ventura
loads properly. This does not happen in Windows 3.0.

There is no solution to this problem. Xerox is aware of the problem and may
address it in the next release.
