SUMMARY
=======

The Citizen narrow carriage 9-pin printer (200GX) has an 8-inch printable
region. This means that there is an unprintable region of 0.5 inch on the left
side of the page.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Editing applications react differently to this printer limitation. The following
is a list of known behaviors:

 - Microsoft Windows Write does NOT allow you to have a left margin less than
   0.5 inch; this eliminates any problems with this printer limitation.

 - Microsoft Word for Windows does allow you to set the left margin to less than
   0.5 inch; however, the text is truncated on the left when it is printed.

The Citizen narrow-carriage printer is manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
