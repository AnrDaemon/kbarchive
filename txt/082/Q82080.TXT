SUMMARY
=======

The MicroMASTER 486, AOX Inc.'s upgrade card for the IBM PS/2, may require a
virtual device driver with certain SCSI adapters for proper Windows 386 enhanced
mode operation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MicroMASTER upgrades the processor of an IBM PS/2. If an upgrade board and a
SCSI adapter are both present, you may need to add the virtual device driver
MMVDMAD.386 to the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.

Two 386 enhanced mode problems may occur:

 - Windows installed on the SCSI drive doesn't run.

 - Windows installed on a second, non-SCSI drive in a dual hard drive system
   cannot access the SCSI drive.

These problems can be corrected by installing the MMVDMAD.386 virtual device
driver.

Copy the file MMVDMAD.386 from the MicroMASTER option disk to the Windows SYSTEM
subdirectory, and add the following line to the [386Enh] section of the
SYSTEM.INI file:

   Device=MMVDMAD.386
