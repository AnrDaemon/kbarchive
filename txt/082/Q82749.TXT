SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Windows version 3.1, the LPT1.DOS printer port connection has
exactly the same effect as typing LPT1.DOS (or LPT1.OS2) when printing to a
FILE:. If you type LPT1.DOS (or LPT1.OS2), a message box asking "Overwrite
existing file?" appears. Choose the Yes button to print. This message appears
because MS-DOS assumes that the file LPT1.xxx (where xxx is any extension)
always exists.

Note that the LPT1.OS2 or LPT1.DOS syntax is not required. It is included in
Windows 3.1 for backward compatibility only. Using LPT1 (or typing LPT1 in the
FILE: output file dialog box) has the same effect.

LPT2 and LPT3 connections behave similarly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A problem in Windows 3.0 was corrected to allow binary files to be printed to
LPT1.xxx-style ports. In Windows 3.0, the output was copied to the port using a
command similar to the MS-DOS COPY command without the /B parameter, which would
stop the output if a CTRL+Z (^Z) End-of- File (EOF) character was found in the
output. The port is now written to in a raw mode, allowing binary data
containing EOF characters to be written.


Additional query words: 3.10 3.11 binary EOF end-of-file /B
