SUMMARY
=======

If you play MIDI files from Midisoft Studio for Windows version 3.0 and run the
files from Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, there may be no
output or a faint crackling sound when playing sample MIDI files using the
Windows MIDI Driver.

This problem occurs because Midisoft Studio only uses the first MIDI device
listed in the SYSTEM.INI file and does not look at the settings in the MIDI
Mapper. To correct this problem, do the following:

1. Edit SYSTEM.INI with an ASCII text editor.

2. In the [drivers] section look for the "MIDI=" and "MIDI1=" lines. Edit these
   lines so that what was listed after MIDI= is replaced by what was listed
   after MIDI1= and vice versa.

   For example:

   Before

      [drivers]
      MIDI=msadlib.drv
      MIDI1=sndblst2.drv

   After

      [drivers]
      MIDI=sndblst2.drv
      MIDI1=msadlib.drv

3. Save your changes and restart Windows.
