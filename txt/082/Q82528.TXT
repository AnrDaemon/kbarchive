SUMMARY
=======

Some printers will not receive the correct resolution when resetting in Excel
version 4.0 running under the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1.
This problem is caused when Excel 4.0 is used with the Panasonic KX-P1124 (or
other dot-matrix printers using the same resolution as the default printer).

When Print Quality (from the Excel 4.0 File menu, choose Print) is changed to 360
dpi to obtain 360 x 360 resolution, 360 x 180 dpi is the output. If the Print
Quality setting is re-examined, the 360 x 180 resolution is displayed instead of
the 360 x 360 selected earlier.

The Control Panel must be used to change the resolution to obtain the correct
printout and setting.
