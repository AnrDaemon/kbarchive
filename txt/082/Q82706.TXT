-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Under Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, switching to the No
Network Installed option does not remove WINPOPUP.EXE from the WIN.INI file.
This information applies only to systems running Microsoft LAN Manager versions
2.x. Running WinPopup can cause problems when reconfiguring Windows for the No
Network Installed option.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Switching to the No Network Installed option in Setup (both Windows and MS-DOS
maintenance mode) does not remove WINPOPUP.EXE from the LOAD= line in the
WIN.INI file. If WINPOPUP.EXE is on the LOAD= line and the system is
reconfigured back to the previous network (LAN Manager 2.x), a dialog box may
appear, asking you to insert Windows 3.1 Disk #3 or give a new path to the file
below. (No filename is specified.) If you move the dialog box window, you can
see a box behind it that lists WINPOPUP.EXE.

If you enter the path to WINPOPUP.EXE, the following message appears:

   Setup is unable to install the file: WINPOPUP.EXE.
   This file is currently in use by Windows. To upgrade the driver and related
   files you have selected, exit Windows and start Setup from the MS-DOS command
   prompt.

After you choose the OK button, another message comes up:

   Setup was unable to copy all the files necessary for the complete
   installation of the driver you selected. To install this driver, you need to
   correct the file copy errors.

To remove these error messages, close WINPOPUP.EXE. The network should install
correctly.
