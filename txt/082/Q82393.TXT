MORE INFORMATION
================

VRAM386.SYS is similar to EMM386.EXE. It converts extended memory to to the
Expanded Memory Specification (EMS) LIM version 4.0 standard.

HRAMDEV.SYS can create up to 944K of conventional memory depending on the
hardware configuration. HRAM.SYS and HRAM.EXE function as loaders equivalent to
the MS-DOS DEVICEHIGH and LOADHIGH functions.
