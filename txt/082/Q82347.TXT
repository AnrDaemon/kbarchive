SUMMARY
=======

Ami Pro may cause a general protection (GP) fault under Microsoft Windows
version 3.1 when Facing Page view is selected with certain data files. Lotus
development is aware of this problem and it has been corrected in Ami Pro
version 2.0a.

Windows 3.0 generates an Unrecoverable Application Error (UAE) in the same
situation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The file PRINTEST.SAM, a sample data file provided with Ami Pro, is an example
of a data file that may cause a GP fault. Once this file is loaded, choosing
Facing Pages from the View menu may cause a GP fault. This problem seems to only
occur with this particular file and may not be reproduced during every test.


The Ami Pro product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
