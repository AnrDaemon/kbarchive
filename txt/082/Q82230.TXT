======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to load Microsoft Windows 3.0 in standard mode or 386 enhanced
mode, you may receive the following error message:

   Invalid HIMEM.SYS;
   Install HIMEM.SYS from your Windows Setup disks

CAUSE
=====

This error message can be caused by the following problems:

 - Wrong version of HIMEM.SYS

 - Corrupted HIMEM.SYS

 - Trying to run Windows from an MS-DOS prompt inside Windows

RESOLUTIONS

Each of these problems and their resolutions is described in detail below.

Wrong Version of HIMEM.SYS
--------------------------

The CONFIG.SYS file contains the line "DEVICE=drive:\path\HIMEM.SYS." If the
HIMEM.SYS being loaded is from versions of Windows prior to Windows 3.0 or
versions of MS-DOS prior to MS-DOS 5.0, these error messages may appear.

The versions of HIMEM.SYS that you can use with Windows 3.0 are listed below.

 - Version 2.60 Supplied with Windows 3.0 and 3.0a File Size 11,304 bytes

To restore HIMEM.SYS, use the EXPAND.EXE utility to expand the file HIMEM.SY$ to
HIMEM.SYS in the directory that is specified in the CONFIG.SYS file.

+-----------------------------------------------------+
| File       | 3.5-Inch Disk Set | 5.25-Inch Disk Set | 
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| EXPAND.EXE | Disk 2            | Disk 2             | 
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| HIMEM.SY$  | Disk 5            | Disk 3             | 
+-----------------------------------------------------+

 - Version 2.77 Supplied with the MS-DOS 5.0 and 5.0a Upgrades File Size 11,552
   bytes

To restore HIMEM.SYS, use the EXPAND.EXE utility to expand the file HIMEM.SY_ to
HIMEM.SYS in the directory that is specified in the CONFIG.SYS file.

+-----------------------------------------------------+
| File       | 3.5-Inch Disk Set | 5.25-Inch Disk Set | 
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| EXPAND.EXE | Disk 3            | Disk 6             | 
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| HIMEM.SY_  | Disk 1            | Disk 2             | 
+-----------------------------------------------------+

The syntax for the EXPAND utility is "EXPAND source destination". The following
is an example:

C:\>EXPAND A:HIMEM.SY_ C:\HIMEM.SYS

Corrupted HIMEM.SYS
-------------------

If the HIMEM.SYS being loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file is the right version but has
been corrupted (or is otherwise invalid and not operating properly with Windows
3.0), the aforementioned error messages may appear. Restore the file from your
Windows 3.0 or MS-DOS 5.0 Upgrade disks using the above instructions.

Trying to Run Windows from an MS-DOS Prompt Inside Windows
----------------------------------------------------------

If you attempt to run Windows after switching to MS-DOS from within Windows by
choosing the MS-DOS Prompt icon, the aforementioned error messages may occur.
Type "exit" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt to return to
Windows.
