SUMMARY
=======

At small point sizes, TrueType fonts look like simple Serif or Sans Serif fonts
on the screen but print as you would expect. This is due to automatic bitmap
font substitution, which is done to preserve readability at small sizes when
fonts are displayed on the screen.

MORE INFORMATION
================

At very small point sizes (4 to 7 points on standard VGA video resolutions),
most Type 2 fonts are substituted with a hand-tuned bitmap font to preserve
readability. This can cause the style of the font to change. For example, the
Lucida Blackletter font shipped with the FontPack appears as a simple Serif font
at sizes 4 - 7 pts rather than the Gothic appearance is has at larger sizes.
When the document containing the font is printed, however, the font appears
correct even at very small sizes.
