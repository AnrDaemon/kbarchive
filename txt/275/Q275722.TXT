The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3

SYMPTOMS
========

APPC/5250 applications connecting to SNA Server computers that are configured
for APPC Load Balancing and Hot Backup may be slow to reestablish a session to a
backup server once the primary node/connection becomes unavailable.

CAUSE
=====

If a client has an APPC/5250 session through an existing SNA Server which
becomes unavailable, the client still attempts (two more times) to reestablish
itself to the same SNA Server before moving onto the second server.

==========
