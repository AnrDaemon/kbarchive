KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When the Inventory Data Loader is unable to process a Management Information
Format (MIF) inventory file, the following error message may be displayed:

   SMS Inventory Data Loader failed to process the delta MIF file %1 and has
   moved it to %2.

   Possible cause: The file is corrupt or contains bad syntax. Solution: Review
   the immediately preceding status messages from this component for more
   details.

   If you ignore this problem, SMS will probably fix it and complete this
   operation later. If this error occurs repeatedly, refer to your SMS
   documentation or the Microsoft Knowledge Base for further troubleshooting
   information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The preceding error message may be displayed because of the following possible
reasons:

 - The MIF file is incorrectly formatted.

 - The MIF file is a delta inventory file from a client that has not yet
   reported a full inventory.

 - The MIF file is a delta inventory file that contains conflicting information
   from the currently stored inventory data for the client.

The Inventory Data Loader can automatically attempt to access the MIF inventory
file for the next 14 days. At the end of 14 days, if the Inventory Data Loader
is still unable to process the MIF file, it discards it as a defective MIF file.
