The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5

SUMMARY
=======

When you send a message through a newly configured Microsoft Exchange Connector
for Lotus cc:Mail, the message is received in cc:Mail with white text on a blue
background even if the message body colors are not set as such on the cc:Mail
post offices where the mailboxes reside.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install a new cc:Mail post office, you can also set default colors for
the message body. If the downstream cc:Mail post offices have been configured
for black text and white background, and the cc:Mail post office to which the
Connector for cc:Mail connects has not set the message body default colors, even
though there are no users on the post office that are connected to Exchange
Server, all messages that pass through this post office will have the blue
background with white text regardless of the setting at the downstream post
offices.
