======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, versions 1.0, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

COM Transaction Integrator (COMTI) Component Builder lets the user describe
parameters to methods. If you add a parameter of type Decimal, the Component
Builder limits the "COBOL Data Type" value of the Decimal parameter to a maximum
of 18 digits. However, if a host application is written in a programming
language other than COBOL, a decimal parameter that is passed to Customer
Information Control System (CICS) may require more than 18 digits.

If you right-click the parameter in Component Builder to bring up the Parameter
Properties dialog box, and then click the COBOL Definition tab, you see two spin
boxes that allow you to specify the number of digits to the left and right of
the parameter's decimal point. The sum of the left and right values default to a
maximum of 18. If you try to add numbers with a sum greater than 18, you receive
a "DTCOB390" error message.

CAUSE
=====

Component Builder limits all Decimal datatypes to a maximum of 18 digits to
comply with COBOL specifications.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version
4.0.

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you are converting data to and from Windows Automation datatypes, COMTI
Component Builder uses the idiom of COBOL to represent the equivalent mainframe
datatypes. COBOL datatypes COMP, COMP-3, and DISPLAY are limited to 18 digits.
This is in accordance with COBOL specifications. However the mainframe hardware
is capable of storing up to 29 digits in a BCD number. Some mainframe languages
exploit this capability to let applications use packed decimals up to 29 digits
long.

When you are using COMTI with a host application that is written in COBOL, a
decimal parameter should never be more than 18 digits long. However, if the host
application is written in a language that supports longer packed decimal types,
the hotfix allows the longer length to be defined. A decimal datatype cannot
exceed 29 digits; this would exceed the size of packed decimal that s370
architecture can handle.
