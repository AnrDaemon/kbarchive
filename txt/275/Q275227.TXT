TITLE   :XADM: Error Message: "Unable to Expand the Folder"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server 
 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Outlook 2000, Service Release 1 (SR-1) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Users cannot log on to their Exchange 2000 mailbox with Outlook 2000 for the
first time. Actually, Outlook starts without error, and users can see default
folders, but when they attempt to open one of the folders, they receive the
following error message:

   Unable to expand the folder. The set of folders could not be opened. The
   attempt to log on to the Microsoft Exchange Server computer has failed.

In the Application event log, there are events which suggest a successful logon,
but there is also the following event:

   Event ID: 9562
   Source: MSExchangeIS
   Description: Failed to read attribute msExchUSRAccountControl from active
   directory for /o=Org/ou=Administrative Group/cn=Recipient
   Container/cn=Mailbox.

CAUSE
=====

The schema for Exchange 2000 was not properly extended when you upgraded from
Release Candidate 2 (RC2) to the Release to Manufacturing (RTM) version.
Specifically, you did not re-run forestprep with the RTM version of Exchange
2000 Setup. As a result, the msExchUSRAccountControl attribute was not added to
the schema. This is a required attribute that was added post-RC2.

RESOLUTION
==========

After you run /forestprep, which forces replication to the child domain, run
/domainprep in the child domain, and rebuild the Recipient Update Service
objects. Then you can log on to your mailboxes.
