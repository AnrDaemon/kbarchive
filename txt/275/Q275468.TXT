======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server Message Transfer Agent (MTA) does not deliver
messages over a dynamic Remote Access Service (RAS) connector, an X.400
connector, or a site connector or during intra-site communication. When you set
the MTA diagnostic logging level to Maximum for Field Engineering and X.400
Service categories, the following events are reported in the application event
log (numbers in the descriptions may vary):

   Event ID: 9322
   Source: MSExchangeMTA
   Description: An interface error has occurred. An MtaBindBack over RPC has
   failed. Locality Table (LTAB) index: %1, NT/MTA error code:14. Comms error
   %3, Bind error %4,Remote Server Name %5, Protocol String %6 [%7 %8 %9 %10].

   Event ID: 9318
   Source: MSExchangeMTA
   Description: An RPC communications error occurred. Unable to bind over RPC.
   Locality Table (LTAB) index: %1, NT/MTA error code: 14. Comms error %3, Bind
   error %4...,

When you attempt to troubleshoot using the RPC ping command, the following
message is logged:

   -RpcServerUseProtSeqEp returned a status 0xE

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if your computer does not have enough available Random
Access Memory (RAM).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, check the computer's available RAM with either
Performance Monitor or Task Manager, and then close programs to make more RAM
available. After you restart the computer, if the computer still does not have
enough RAM, you have to add more RAM to your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine the meaning of the error message, type "Net Helpmsg 14" (without
the quotation marks) at a command prompt. (The hex value 0xE is equal to a
decimal value of 14.) The Windows NT error is translated as: "Not enough storage
is available to complete this operation." The word "storage" in this message
refers to RAM.

Additional query words: "remote procedure call"
