TITLE   :XADM: Cannot Reply to Mail Sent From User That Changed Sites
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you move a user account from one Exchange Server site to another by copying
the mailbox information to a .pst file, deleting the existing mailbox,
recreating it in the destination site, and then importing the .pst (or by using
ExMerge), if messages are sent from that user account before the move, the
receiver may not be able to reply to the messages. The sender may receive a
non-delivery report (NDR) that contains the following error message:

   The recipient name is not recognized

In addition, any calendar appointments that contain the moved user account are no
longer linked to that user account.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the X.500 address of the user account has changed.
The site name is part of the X.500 address, which Exchange Server uses for
internal mail addressing.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, add an X.500 address that is equivalent to the X.500
address of the mailbox before the move to the new user account mailbox:

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program.

2. Click the mailbox for the user in the destination site.

   NOTE: Make sure that the mailbox from the original site has been deleted, and
   that the deletion has been replicated to this destination site.

3. Click the E-mail Addresses tab, click New, click "Other Address" and then
   click OK.

4. In the E-mail Address box, type the following text, where
   <organization> is the name of the Exchange Server organization,
   <site> is the name of the previous Exchange Server site, <Recipients
   Container> is the name of the recipients container where this mailbox had
   been created, and <alias> is the X.500 common name (or alias) for the
   user.

   "/o=<organization>/ou=<site>/cn=<Recipients
   Container>/cn=<alias>" (without the quotation marks)

   For example, if you move a server in an Exchange Server organization that is
   named "TestCo" from a site that is named "TestSite", and the mailbox used to
   be in the "Recipients" container, and the user's X.500 common name is
   TestUser, you use the following X.500 address:

   "/o=TestCo/ou=TestSite/cn=Recipients/cn=TestUser" (without the quotation
   marks)

   NOTE: Make sure to keep the case of the letters consistent with the case that
   is displayed in the Administrator program.

5. In the E-mail type box, type "X500" (without the quotation marks).
