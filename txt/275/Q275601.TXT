TITLE   :Virtual Directory Names with Executable Extensions Are Not Used
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::3.0,4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a virtual directory name ends with an executable extension (such as .com,
.exe, .dll or .sh), the files in this virtual directory cannot be viewed with a
Web browser.

If the execution rights are not set in this virtual directory, the following
error message occurs:

   403.1 - Forbidden: Execute Access Forbidden

If the execution rights are set, then the following error message occurs:

   404 - File not found

Under some circumstances the source code of an Active Server Pages (ASP) page may
be returned to the client if it is placed in a virtual directory with an
executable extension.

CAUSE
=====

IIS interprets the virtual directory with an executable extension as an
executable file and tries to run this file. The rest of the URL is passed in the
Path_Info variable. Tools such as the FrontPage Server Extensions make use of
this functionality.
