SYMPTOMS

If you send villagers to construct a building in Microsoft Age of Empires, the
villagers may stand in the building foundation and do nothing.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if either of the following conditions is true:

 - A new villager who is created by a Town Center is directed to a gather point
   that is placed on an abandoned foundation.

 - A villager who is instructed to start a building is redirected after the
   foundation is placed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To prevent this issue from occurring, do not place gather points in building
foundations.
