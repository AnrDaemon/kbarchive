TITLE   :XCON: MTA Does Not Send X.400 O/R Address Across X.400 Connector
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) only includes the full X.400
O/R Reply-To address the first time that a message is sent across an
unreplicated X.400 Connector with Microsoft Database Format (MDBEF) enabled.
After a message has been sent across an X.400 Connector, only distinguished
names are included in the messages. This behavior causes the recipients to
receive non-delivery reports (NDRs) when they attempt to reply to the sender's
message.

CAUSE
=====

This problem only occurs when the X.400 Connector is configured to use address
spaces without using the Connected Sites Configuration tab on unreplicated X.400
Connectors with MDBEF enabled. When the Connected Sites tab is configured on
both sides of the X.400 Connector, each bridgehead has the other site's
distinguished name included in the Gateway Address Routing Table (GWART), and
the messages are deliverable because the necessary routing information is
available. This behavior occurs for both one-off X.400 addresses as well as
X.400 custom recipients.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, click to clear the "Allow MS Exchange contents" check
box on the Advanced tab of the unreplicated X.400 Connector Property page.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
