The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the Mailbox Manager utility that is shipped with Exchange
Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 (SP3). You can use this utility to monitor mailboxes
on various Exchange Server computers in the site based on set policies. However,
Mailbox Manager does not send any user notifications when it is operating in
Audit mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Mailbox Manager operates in two modes, Audit mode and Cleanup Mailboxes mode. To
choose the mode that Mailbox Manager operates in, click the General tab, and
then click either the Cleanup Mailboxes option or the Audit option.

You can configure Mailbox Manager to send a summary report or a detailed report
to an administrator mailbox when Mailbox Manager is operating in either of these
modes. In addition, you can configure Mailbox Manager to send notifications to
users. To do so, click the Notification tab in the Configuration window for
Mailbox Manager, and then click to select the Notify Users check box.
Alternatively, if you click to clear this check box, notifications are not sent
to users.

User notifications can only be sent when Mailbox Manager is operating in Cleanup
Mailboxes mode; user notifications are not sent when Mailbox Manager is in Audit
mode. However, because the Notification tab is always available, it may seem
that you can configure Mailbox Manager to send user notifications in either
mode.
