SUMMARY
=======

This article contains some helpful tips and suggestions for how to fly training
missions in Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To successfully complete a training mission in Combat Flight Simulator 2:

 - Follow the Instructor Carefully

   Some maneuvers may take longer than expected.

 - Use the Default Aircraft to Fly Training Missions

   Aircraft characteristics may vary.

   The American default aircraft is the Corsair. The Japanese default aircraft is
   the Zero.

 - Japanese Training Mission 05

   The text that explains that you must invert for the "Split S" maneuver does
   not appear until you complete the maneuver.

 - Japanese Training Mission 06

   There is a conflict between two audio tracks. A report of bandits in your
   sector and the instructor's voice are played at the same time. The bandit
   report may not be audible.

 - American and Japanese Training Mission 10

   The "Show Maneuver" video clip depicts the aircraft making an approach that
   does not reflect the description that is portrayed in the training mission.
   This training mission is a straight-in approach, not a traffic pattern
   approach.
