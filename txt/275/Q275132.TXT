======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 hierarchy contains several thousand
sites, the SMS Executive service can consume up to 100 percent of the available
processor usage on a central site. Specifically, the threads that follow
components of the SMS Executive service can consume a large amount of processor
usage:

 - SMS Collection Evaluator
 - SMS Discovery Data Manager
 - SMS Distribution Manager
 - SMS Hierarchy Manager
 - SMS Offer Manager
 - SMS Scheduler

CAUSE
=====

Several components of the SMS Executive service build an ordered array of the
site hierarchy in memory to accomplish some of their operations. The more sites
that exist in the hierarchy, the longer it takes to build the site array, and
more processor usage is consumed. If the number of sites exceeds several
thousand, the overall performance of the system begins to degrade because the
SMS Executive service consumes most of the available processor usage.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
