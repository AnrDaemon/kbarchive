======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, versions 1.0, 1.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a mainframe computer, the Customer Information Control System (CICS) allows
terminals that are connected to one CICS region, a Terminal Owning Region (TOR),
to run transactions on another CICS region, an Application Owning Region (AOR).

When you run COM Transaction Integrator (COMTI) through CICS Link by using LU
version 6.2, if the program that is being called is to be run in an AOR, the
default CICS mirror transaction ID (CSMI) is always passed to the AOR even if
COMTI is configured to invoke some mirror transaction other than CSMI in the
TOR. There are circumstances where a different mirror transaction ID may be
desirable for security or tracking purposes.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, specify the correct mirror transaction ID in the PPT
table for the remote transaction program. When this is done in the TOR, then the
correct mirror transaction ID is passed to the AOR.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1), 4.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2), 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3),
Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS versions 1.0, 1.0 SP1, 4.0
SP2, 4.0 SP3.

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Once the update is applied, the Source TP Name that is specified in the Host
Names Tab of the Method Properties within the COMTI Component Builder will be
passed as the mirror transaction ID to be used by the AOR.
