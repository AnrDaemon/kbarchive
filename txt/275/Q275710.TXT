The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server may log several event 21 errors in the application event log. The
first event 21 error contains a subcode of X'1124' and a sense code of 1003:

   EventID : 21
   Source : SNA Server
   Description : (1124) Negative Response Sent on Connection TESTCONN (SENSE =
   1003)
   Explanation : SUBCODE INFORMATION:
   X'1124' A negative response was sent and logged. This error normally follows a
   more specific error message, depending on the type of negative response sent
   and its cause. The SNA sense data provides details about the type of error.
   ACTION:
   See "IBM Systems Network Architecture: Formats" for an explanation of the
   sense data.

The subsequent entries contain a subcode of X'1124' and sense code 2004:

   EventID : 21
   Source : SNA Server
   Description : (1124) Negative Response Sent on Connection TESTCONN (SENSE =
   2004)
   Explanation : SUBCODE INFORMATION:
   X'1124' A negative response was sent and logged. This error normally follows a
   more specific error message, depending on the type of negative response sent
   and its cause. The SNA sense data provides details about the type of error.
   ACTION:
   See "IBM Systems Network Architecture: Formats" for an explanation of the
   sense data.

These errors indicate that SNA Server has sent negative responses to the host
system in response to incoming host requests.

CAUSE
=====

An incoming request that is from a host system may have the change direction
(CD) bit set, which indicates that direction should be given to the client
system. However, if the client responds negatively to the host request (which
causes the X'1003' negative response to be sent to the host), direction is then
supposed to be determined by the recovery responsibility information in the
BIND. When these circumstances occur, the TN3270 Service, in some cases,
incorrectly interprets that direction should be given to the client system, even
though the BIND indicates that direction should be given to the host system in
recovery situations. When the next request is then sent down from the host
system, the TN3270 Service believes that the client, not the host, is in a send
state, and therefore returns a negative response with the X'2004' direction
error.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
