SYMPTOMS

When you migrate from Lotus Notes, the Migration Wizard may fail, and the
following event ID messages may be logged:

   Event ID: 181
   Source:MSExchangeMigDS
   Type: Error
   Description: Could not bind to the Microsoft Exchange Directory server
   <Server_name>.
   The Microsoft Exchange Server computer does not respond.

   -and-

   Event ID: 10052
   Source:MSExchangeMig
   Type: Error
   Description: Invalid Server specified or you do not have the permission
   required to complete the operation.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you specified an incorrect Exchange Server computer or
if the server cannot be reached.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following troubleshooting procedure:

1. Check that the directory service on the Exchange Server computer where you
   are migrating to is running.

2. If you are using a control file, ensure that the Home-Server keyword is
   displayed.

3. Check the spelling of the name of the server that is displayed in the control
   file. To verify the correct name of the server, use the Microsoft Exchange
   Server Administrator program to view the properties of the server.

4. Run the following command to check for name resolution and connectivity to
   the server:

   "ping -a <ip_address>" (without the quotation marks)

When you run this command, the name of the server is returned.
