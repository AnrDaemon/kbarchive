======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create or edit a view using the View Designer, the number of decimal
places for data types mapped as Double data type is set to 3 under the Fields
Data Mapping property.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the DBSETPROP() function to set the number of decimal places for the field:

   DBSETPROP('MYVIEW.MYFIELD','FIELD','DATATYPE','B(5)')


MORE INFORMATION
================

This is a display anomaly in the View Designer. Views that map fields to a
Double data type will be displayed as defined.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a program file named Vfpview.prg and paste the following code:

   IF !FILE("FLOTDEMO.DBC")
      CREATE DATABASE FLOTDEMO
      CREATE TABLE FLOATER (ident i PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, dblfld b(5) NOT NULL)
      CREATE SQL VIEW FLOTVIEW AS SELECT * FROM FLOATER
   ELSE
      OPEN DATA FLOTDEMO
   ENDIF
   *!* Explicitly set the number of decimal places to 5.
   =DBSETPROP('FLOTVIEW.DBLFLD','FIELD','DATATYPE','B(5)')
   MODI VIEW FLOTVIEW

2. Save and then run Vfpview.prg.

3. When the View Designer appears, click the Properties button.

4. In the View Field Properties dialog box, select floater.dblfld.

5. Note the decimal value displayed under Data Mapping.
