TITLE   :XCON: Exchange Server MTA Does Not Process Accented Characters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFEA exc55 kbExchange550SP5Fea kbExchange550PreSP5fea

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

If attachments with file names that contain accented characters (escape
sequences) are sent to and from Exchange Server computers, when a user tries to
save the file in the client, the file name is not preserved. Instead, the
accented characters are replaced by an ASCII representation of that character
because the message transfer agent (MTA) does not process escape sequences in
attachment names.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A supported feature that modifies the product's default behavior is now
available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to modify the behavior
described in this article and should be applied only to systems having a
specific need for it. This feature may receive additional testing at a later
time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you are not severely
affected by the lack of this feature, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the
next Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 service pack that contains this
feature.

To obtain this feature immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services.
