TITLE   :BUG: Custom Build Step Is Not Applied to New Configuration
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbide kbVC600 kbVC600bug kbDevStudio kbDSupport kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add a new configuration to a Visual C++ project, a file that used a
custom build step may not inherit the custom build step in the new
configuration.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you have closed and reopened the workspace, you must manually copy the custom
build step from the old configuration to the new configuration.

If you have not closed and reopened the workspace, perform the following steps:

1. Set the active configuration to the new configuration.

2. Right-click the file that uses the custom build step, and click Settings.

3. Note that the Always use custom build step check box is selected even though
   the custom build step is gone. Clear and reselect this check box. The Custom
   Build tab reappears with all of the correct steps.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem only occurs when custom build steps are applied to files with a
default tool (.c*, .idl, .odl and .rc files).

NOTE: A project that is generated with the Visual C++ 5.0 Active Template Library
(ATL) Component Object Model (COM) AppWizard uses a file level custom build step
to compile the .idl file.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) AppWizard Dialog project.

2. On the FileView tab, click to expand the Source Files folder.

3. Right-click the Stdafx.cpp file, and click Settings.

4. In the Project Settings dialog box, click the General tab, and then select
   the Always use custom build step check box.

5. On the Custom Build tab, in the Command list box, enter "Echo sampletext >
   stdafx.txt" as the command. In the Output list box, enter "Stdafx.txt". Note
   the configuration name, and then click OK.

6. On the Build menu, click Configurations, click Add, and give the
   configuration a name.

7. In the Copy settings from drop-down combo box, select the configuration that
   you noted in step 5, and then click Close.

8. On the Build menu, click Set Active Configuration, and then select the new
   configuration.

9. Close and reopen the workspace.

10. Repeat steps 2 and 3.
