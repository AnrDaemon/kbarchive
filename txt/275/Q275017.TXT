======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you review a software inventory in Resource Explorer for Microsoft Windows
98-based or Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition-based (Me) clients, you observe
that "Microsoft Corporation" is listed as a manufacturer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the Locproxy.exe file which collects the
software inventory information from Windows 98-based and Windows Me-based
clients, has the header information misspelled. The Company Name property in the
header lists "Microsoft Corporation" instead of "Microsoft Corporation."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
