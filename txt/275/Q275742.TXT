   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

Because of the large volume of information that is recorded in the Systems
Management Server (SMS) Provider log file (Smsprov.log), it may be necessary at
some point to increase the size of the log file for later viewing by using
SMSTrace.

Microsoft only recommends increasing the size of the log file when advanced
troubleshooting is necessary.

It is important to keep in mind the size of the log versus the performance. The
log size is specified in hex. For example, a value of 10 would create a 16-MB
log file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To Increase the Size of the SMS Provider Log File
-------------------------------------------------

1. Open the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the value

   Log Size Mb

   under the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Providers

3. On the Edit menu, click DWORD, type "2" (without the quotation marks) (or the
   desired size in megabytes in Hex), and then click OK.

4. Close the Registry Editor.

NOTE: You must stop and then restart the Windows Management Instrumentation
service to make the changes effective.

NOTE: A setting of "0" in the above-referenced registry location causes the
default file size of the Smsprov.log file, which is 512 KB, to be used after
stopping and restarting the SMS_EXECUTIVE service.
