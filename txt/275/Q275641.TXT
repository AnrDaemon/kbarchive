CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if any of the following conditions are true:

 - The program CD-ROM or DVD-ROM is dirty or damaged.

   operation of the program.

 - Certain files on your computer are missing or damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following methods in the order in which they are
presented.

Clean the CD-ROM
----------------

Clean the CD-ROM. To do this, use a CD-ROM cleaning kit, or gently wipe the
silver side of the CD-ROM with a soft, lint-free cotton cloth. Do not use paper
cloth which can scratch the plastic and leave streaks. When you clean the
CD-ROM, wipe from the center of the disc outward. Do not use a circular motion.

If the issue continues to occur, clean the CD-ROM with a damp cloth or a
commercial CD cleaning solution. Dry the CD-ROM thoroughly before you insert it
into the CD-ROM drive.


If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Clean the CD-ROM Drive
----------------------

If cleaning the CD-ROM does not resolve the issue, clean the CD-ROM drive using a
CD-ROM drive cleaning disc if you have one. If you do not have one, obtain one
after all other steps in this article have failed to resolve the issue. CD-ROM
drive cleaning discs are available in most computer stores.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Run the Encarta Repair Feature

1. Quit all programs that are running on your computer.

2. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
