KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to send messages through an Exchange Server 5.5 computer, and the
domain controller becomes unavailable in the domain in which the Exchange Server
5.5 computer is a member, some of the messages may be lost. When this problem
occurs, you do not receive a non-delivery report (NDR), and the messages are
never delivered.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the message transfer agent (MTA) cannot obtain the
information it needs to deliver the messages from the directory service. The
domain controller must be available for the MTA to obtain this information.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.
