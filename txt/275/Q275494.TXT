TITLE   :PRB: IIS 4.0 Userdump Generates a Memory Dump w/ Remote PerfMon
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbiis400

======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a User Mode Process dump from the OEM Support Tools kit
(http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp) on a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 6a (SP6a)/Internet Information Server (IIS) version 4.0 server that
is being remotely monitored by Performance Monitor, the User Mode Process dump
may repeatedly generate memory dump files. In addition you may see the following
events in the event log:

   Event ID: 201
   Src: Udmpsvc
   User Mode Process Dump service was started successfully.

   Event ID: 1010
   Source: Perflib
   The Collect Procedure for the "InetInfo" service in DLL "infoctrs.DLL"
   generated an exception or returned an invalid status. Performance data
   returned by counter DLL will be not be returned in Perf Data Block. Exception
   or status code returned is data DWORD 0.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the User Mode Process dump can only be configured to
dump a process on first chance exceptions. These dumps are being generated
because of first chance "access violations" that are handled by the performance
counters, which do not cause IIS to crash. However, because the User Mode
Process dump cannot be configured to ignore these first chance exceptions (or
first chance exceptions of any kind), it generates a dump file.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two workarounds for this issue:

 - Do not run performance monitor against the IIS server remotely while the User
   Mode Process dump is being used.

-or-

 - Use the IIS Exception Monitor and the Script file customization wizard to
   configure the IIS Exception Monitor to ignore first chance access violations.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
