TITLE   :PRB: DLL Breakpoints Are Skipped or Disabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::3.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDebug kbOSWinCEsearch kbDSupport kbGrpDSETK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Embedded Toolkit for Visual C++ 5.0 
 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual C++ 6.0 
 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual C++ version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While debugging a C++ application in the eMbedded Visual C++ 3.0 development
environment, the following things may occur:

 - Some debug breakpoints in dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) may be skipped.

 - A message or warning dialog box may appear indicating that some breakpoints
   have been disabled and cannot be set.

CAUSE
=====

To enable breakpoints in DLLs, the paths to the DLLs on both the development
computer and the Windows CE target device must be set properly in the project
settings.

RESOLUTION
==========

To set these paths for your Windows CE project, follow these steps:

1. On the Project menu, click Settings. Click the Debug tab, and then click
   Additional DLLs.

2. In Local Name, specify the path of the debug DLL that resides on the
   development (host) computer.

3. In Remote Name, specify the path of the corresponding DLL on the target
   device.

   For example, if debugging an application with a DLL named Util.dll, you can
   set breakpoints in the DLL by using settings that resemble the following:

   Local Name : C:\Program Files\MyProject\WCEDbg\Util.dll
   Remote Name : \Windows\Util.dll

Note that in order for debugging to be accurate, the remote DLL must be an exact
copy of the DLL on the development computer (except for certain debug
information which is automatically stripped when the DLL is transferred to the
target device).

Windows CE Application" in the eMbedded Visual Tools 3.0 online documentation.
