======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message is displayed when Systems Network Architecture (SNA)
Server Manager is started:

   SNAOLE
   FIELD CONFLICT. UNABLE TO CHANGE"

NOTE: This error does not prevent SNA Server Manager from functioning normally.

CAUSE
=====

This error message is displayed when the properties of a link service are
modified after a connection has already been defined to use the particular
link/adapter.

SNA Server Manager still works correctly because SNA Server Manager doesn't
actually allow the change; however, the error is displayed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, change the properties of the link service back to
what is shown in the Connection Properties.

For example, in the Attachmate Advanced SDLC Link Service example that is
described in the "More Information" section, change the link service back from
"Switched: Modem-Stored Number" to "Leased."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Problem
------------------------------

In the following, Attachmate Advanced SDLC Link Service is used as an example:

1. Add Attachmate Advanced SDLC Link Service (use External Link Services), and
   then configure it with a line type of Leased.

2. Add an SDLC connection that uses this link service. Notice that it shows up
   as a Leased Line in SNA Server Manager when you view the connection
   properties.

3. Modify Attachmate Advanced SDLC Link Service such that the line type is
   changed to something other than Leased (for example, Switched: Modem-Stored
   Number).

After you make this change, the SNAOLE error message is displayed every time SNA
Server Manager is started.
