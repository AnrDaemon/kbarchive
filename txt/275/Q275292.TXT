TITLE   :XCON: How to Remove Q251137 Fixes from Exchange Server 5.5 SP3
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5 SP3

KEYWORDS:exc55sp3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you install the message transfer agent (MTA) fixes from the following
Microsoft Knowledge Base article, a backup folder, called Q251137, is created in
the Exchange Server 5.5 Exchsrvr folder:

   Q251137 XADM: Exchange Server 5.5 Post-SP3 Message Transfer Agent Fixes
   Available

This backup folder contains the original files that the fixes replace. If you
need to remove the Q251137 fixes, this article provides the correct way to
restore the MTA to the point before you applied the fixes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Open Microsoft Windows NT Explorer.

2. Browse the drive that Exchange Server is install on, and then expand the
   Exchsrvr folder.

3. Locate and expand the Q251137 folder.

4. Open the Install.txt file with a text editor such as Notepad, or WordPad.

   This text file contains the original file locations and names that the
   hotfixes in Q251137engi.exe replaced during installation. When they are moved
   into the same folder, duplicate files are renamed so that two files with the
   same name can be moved into the Q251137 folder. These must be renamed after
   you restore them to their previous location. Copy the "old" file from the
   Q251137 folder, and place it in the location described in the text file.

   An example of an installation file follows these steps. However, based on
   hardware, performance optimization, or personal choice, this file maybe
   different for every Exchange Server organization.

   The second example shows two sample restore steps.

A sample installation file:

A sample restore:

1. To restore the Emsmta.exe file, copy or move the Emsmta.exe file from the
   C:\Exchsrvr\Q251137\ folder, and then overwrite the file in the path
   C:\Exchsrvr\Bin\ folder.

2. When prompted, select Yes to overwrite the existing file.

A sample of a duplicate file restore:

1. To restore the P2.xv2 file, copy or move the P2.xv2 file from the
   C:\Exchsrvr\Q251137\ folder, and then overwrite the file in the path
   C:\Exchsrvr\Mtadata\ folder.

2. To restore the second P2.xv2 file, copy or move the P2.001 file from the
   C:\Exchsrvr\Q251137\ folder to the C:\Exchsrvr\Bin\ folder.

3. Remove the P2.xv2 file that is located in the C:\Exchsrvr\Bin\ folder.

4. Rename the P2.001 file to P2.xv2.

5. After all files have been placed in the correct locations, restart the
   server. The MTA comes back up restored to the point before you applied the
   fix.
