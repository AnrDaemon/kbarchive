======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2, versions 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Microsoft Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) Driver for DB2 is used to
retrieve data from a DB2 table that contains a binary field that has NULLs
(0x00), then the data is truncated at the first NULL.

For example, if a DB2 table is created and populated with data as follows

   CREATE TABLE OWNER.TABLE (COL1 CHAR (5), COL2 VARCHAR (40))
   INSERT INTO OWNER.TABLE ('00001', '00x100x200x000x3')

then when you select the COL2, just '00x100x2' is returned.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
