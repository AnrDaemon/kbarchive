TITLE   :SMSINST: Logon Server Manager Deletes Smslogon Language Folders
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug smsinst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Logon Server Manager may incorrectly remove language
folders from the Smslogon\X86.bin and Smslogon\Alpha.bin folders when the site
does not contain those languages.

When multiple sites of different languages share Smslogon points, the sites
continually remove language folders, each from the other's site, and then each
computer writes its language back during each Windows NT 4.0 Logon Server
Manager cycle again. When this problem occurs, the client files that are in the
logon points are occasionally unavailable to the client computers. Also, this
behavior may cause excessive bandwidth use, especially when international client
packs are installed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove the Full Control and Modify permissions from
the System Management Server (SMS) Service account to the Smslogon\X86.bin and
Smslogon\Alpha.bin folders, and then give the account all other permissions, so
that Windows NT 4.0 Logon Server Manager can only write, and not delete, files
on each cycle. This behavior prevents the cycling of the files; however, it is
important to verify that any hotfixes or service packs that you install after
you modify the permissions are installed correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
