TITLE   :FP: Prompts for User Name/Password w/Digest Authentication
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows 
 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 2000 and 2002 version of this article, see Q291373.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use Microsoft FrontPage 97 or Microsoft FrontPage 98 to
author a Web site that uses Digest Authentication, you are continually prompted
for a user name and password.

NOTE: Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) versions 5.0 and later can
use a form of Internet security called Digest Authentication, which is defined
in RFC 2069. For more information, see the "References" section later in this
article.

CAUSE
=====

Although Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5.0 and later can use Digest
Authentication, FrontPage 97 and 98 do not support this type of authentication.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, use one of the following authentication methods:

 - Windows Integrated Security on Microsoft Windows 2000.
 - Windows NTLM on Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows 98, Microsoft Windows
   Millennium Edition (Me), and Microsoft Windows NT 4.0.
 - Basic/Clear Text on all versions of Windows.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
