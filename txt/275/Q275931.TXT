TITLE   :XCON: DNS Errors When Installing IMS on Top of Cluster Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the Exchange Internet Mail Service on an Exchange 5.5 server on
top of a Windows 2000 cluster node, you receive the following error message:

   The Internet Mail Service requires DNS domain name to be configured on
   [SERVERNAME]. To configure domain name use network control panel on
   [SERVERNAME] or select another server.

CAUSE
=====

In a normal installation, this error is sufficient for most users to correct the
problem. In a cluster environment, the [SERVERNAME] actually refers to the
Virtual Server name of the cluster.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this behavior in a cluster environment, you need to configure the DNS
host name on all cluster nodes before you can install IMS. The DNS name on each
cluster needs to be unique. Entering the cluster virtual server name on each
machine does not work.

Additional query words: IMS
