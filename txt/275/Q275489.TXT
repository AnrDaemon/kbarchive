PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbtool kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On some Dell computers that are running Microsoft Windows 2000 Server, and
Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) Service Pack 2, the SMS Administrator
Console may stop responding (hang) when you are trying to expand the Site
Hierarchy.

CAUSE
=====

The Dell Version Assistant modifies the default Distributed Component Object
Model (DCOM) user-access permissions to include the currently logged-on user.
This may cause the SMS Administrator Console to stop responding (hang).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, remove the logged-on user account from Default
Access Permissions in the DCOM Configuration utility. To do so, follow these
steps:

1. Click Start, click Run, type "dcomcnfg.exe" (without the quotation marks),
   and then click OK.

2. Click Default Security, and then click Default Access Permissions.

3. Click Edit Default. This tab should be blank. If it is not blank, remove the
   user name that was added by the Dell Version Assistant.
