PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbConfig kbsms120 kbsms120bug kbInventory

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a hardware inventory, a corrupted RAW file may be created. If the
hardware inventory is performed on a client that is not already in the database,
a .mif file cannot be produced by the Systems Management Server (SMS) Inventory
Processor, and the client is not added to the database.

When the server attempts to process a RAW file from a client, the Invproc.log
file that is created by the SMS Inventory Processor may report the following
error messages:

   Reading the RAW file $$<SMS_INVENTORY_PROCESSOR>
   It's for machine HF1004R1 $$<SMS_INVENTORY_PROCESSOR>

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur on some Dell PowerEdge servers that are running Phoenix ROM
BIOS PLUS version 1.10 A04 or A05. On these servers, the date string that is
collected by the SMS Inventory Process is reported by the manufacturer in
European format (YY/MM/DD) instead of American format (MM/DD/YY).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, open an incident with Microsoft Product Support
Services and obtain the hotfix that is described in the following Knowledge Base
article:

   Q239534 SMS: Data Loader Cannot Process MIF Date Above Year 2030

This hotfix provides a resolution for this issue. You are not charged for the
hotfix.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows NT Inventory Agent extracts the video date from the following
registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\HARDWARE\DESCRIPTION\System\VideoBiosDate

This part of the registry is built when Windows NT is started (it is a volatile
part of the registry). If you modify the key, the changes are only valid until
you restart the computer.
