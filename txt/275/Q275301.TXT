The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0, used with:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to add the Kodak Image Edit Controls from the Components dialog
box in the Visual Basic integrated development environment (IDE) on Windows
Millennium Edition (Me), you may receive the following error message:

   " could not be loaded

CAUSE
=====

The registry contains an invalid TypeLib version key.

The Windows Me TypeLib version registry key for the Imgedit.ocx file is for
TypeLib version 2.2, but the Imgedit.ocx file contains TypeLib version 2.1. When
Visual Basic attempts to load the control, it finds that the TypeLib versions do
not match.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, click Run, and type "regsvr32 /u imgedit.ocx" (without the
   quotation marks). This unregisters the control.

2. Click Start, click Run, and type "regsvr32 imgedit.ocx" (without the
   quotation marks). This re-registers the control.

3. In Visual Basic, create a new Standard EXE project.

4. On the Project menu, click Components.

5. Click to select the Kodak Image Edit Control check box.

6. Click Apply.

You can now use the control.
