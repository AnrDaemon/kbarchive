TITLE   :XADM: Backup Over Network Won't Work w. 15-Char. Computer Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you back up an Exchange Server computer over the network, the backup may
stop after a few kilobytes (KB) without any error message. If you run the backup
locally, the backup works as expected.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the computer that is running the Ntbackup.exe program
to back up the Exchange Server computer over the network has a computer name
that contains 15 characters or more (for example, if the Ntbackup.exe program
runs on a computer that has the name Reallybigserver). The name of the Exchange
Server computer is not important.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
