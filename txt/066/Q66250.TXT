SUMMARY
=======

When you are using File Manager, it is not possible to drag and drop a file into
a directory on the Novell server in which you have all rights if you do not have
at least the Search (S) right in the directory above the current directory. The
following messages occur

   Error Copying/Moving File
   Cannot replace <drive>:\<directory>: Access Denied

where <drive> and <directory> are the drive and directory into which
you are trying to drag and drop the file.

NOTE: That this behavior also occurs when using the keyboard to copy or move a
file if you do not give the full pathname AND filename in the To box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Workarounds
-----------

There are several workarounds to this behavior, as follows:

1. Have the system administrator grant the Search (S) right in the directory
   above the one you are trying to drop the file into.

2. Use the keyboard to copy or move the file, and give the full pathname AND
   filename in the To box.

3. Change the drive mappings so that the directory to which the file is being
   copied/moved appears to be a root directory rather than a subdirectory.
