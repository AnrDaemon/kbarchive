SUMMARY
=======

After recording a dynamic scenery pattern, option 3 in the Record Pattern menu
allows you to select an object to follow the pattern. You can choose any of the
objects displayed in this field, including sailboats, cars, trucks, etc., for
ANY recorded pattern. It is therefore possible to create flying sailboats, cars,
trucks, etc.

This is a design feature of Aircraft & Scenery Designer version 4.00.
