TITLE   :Flight Simulator: Proper Display Option for VGA LCD Display

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

When running Flight Simulator 3.x or 4.x on a system with a liquid- crystal VGA
display, choose option D [Liquid Crystal Display (CGA)] when you're asked what
display type is being used in the Flight Simulator start-up menus.

Currently, CGA is the highest resolution supported by Flight Simulator on
liquid-crystal displays (LCDs).

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, when Flight Simulator is run on an NEC ProSpeed 386 laptop with VGA
LCD display, and option M (VGA 16 color 640 x 350 Enhanced) is chosen, pull-down
menu options are not visible in Flight Simulator, and the sky will appear black.
Using display option D corrects these problems.

Additional query words: Monochrome EGA VGA
