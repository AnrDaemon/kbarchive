SUMMARY
=======

The following are options saved between sessions of Tetris in the Microsoft
Windows Entertainment Pack volume 1:

   Sound
   Piece Preview
   Track High Scores
   Starting Level
   Number of Starting Rows

The Option menu's 2-Player mode is not saved between sessions of Tetris. By
design, Tetris will always start in 1-Player mode because this is more common
than 2-Player mode.
