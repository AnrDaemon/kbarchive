SUMMARY
=======

The Windows Entertainment Pack volume 1 game TicTactics is a variation of the
traditional game Tic-Tac-Toe. There are three different boards from which to
choose: 3 x 3, 3 x 3 x 3, and 4 x 4 x 4.

The 3 x 3 is the standard line up, with three pieces in a row either
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The 3 x 3 x 3 game is a bit more
complicated. The object is the same; however, instead of two-dimensional
horizontal, vertical, and diagonal rows, the game is three-dimensional. The 4 x
4 x 4 game is even more difficult, allowing 16 squares and 70 possible winning
rows.

TicTactics allows three different levels of play, Beginner, Intermediate, and
Expert. There is also the option of either a random player starting (you or the
computer), blue always starting (you), or red always starting (the computer).
The only way to occupy a square is by pointing to that square and clicking the
mouse button. You can retrace your steps by clicking the opposite mouse button.
