SUMMARY
=======

When the IdleWild screen saver blanks the screen under Windows, the mouse
pointer is not concealed, and will be the same shape that it was when the screen
blanked.

If the mouse is moved after IdleWild blanks the screen, the movement will be
detected and the normal screen will be restored. IdleWild has no effect on the
mouse cursor.
