-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Unlike Windows versions 2.x, versions 3.0 and 3.1 of Microsoft Windows permit an
application to play a metafile into another metafile. Under Windows 3.0, the
destination metafile must be a disk-based metafile. This restriction has been
removed from Windows 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Under Windows 3.0, playing a metafile into a new memory metafile fails. The
following is a code fragment that demonstrates the correct procedure for
successfully playing a metafile into a new, disk-based metafile that is
compatible with both Windows 3.0 and 3.1.

   / declare variables
      HANDLE hDestDC, hSrcHmf;

   // get a handle to the source metafile
      hSrcHmf = GetMetaFile((LPSTR)"SOURCE.WMF");

   // create a disk-based destination metafile
   // NOTE: The parameter cannot be NULL.
   //       That would create a memory metafile.
      hDestDC = CreateMetaFile((LPSTR)"DEST.WMF");

   // play the source metafile into the newly created metafile
      PlayMetaFile(hDestDC, hSrcHmf) ;

   // get rid of the source metafile
      DeleteMetaFile(hSrcHmf) ;

   // close the destination metafile
      hSrcHmf = CloseMetaFile(hDestDC) ;

At this point, the handle to the destination metafile can be used, or it can be
deleted and retrieved later when it is needed.
