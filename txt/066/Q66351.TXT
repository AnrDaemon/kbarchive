SUMMARY
=======

The Windows Entertainment Pack volume 1 game Pegged is played by moving a peg
across any adjacent peg, and placing it into an open space on the other side.
Only horizontal and vertical jumps are allowed; no diagonal jumps are permitted.
The peg that has been jumped over is automatically removed from the board. The
object of the game is to jump all the other pegs so there is only one remaining
at the end.

Pegged offers seven different patterns from which to choose, with Cross being the
easiest and Solitaire being the most difficult. Pegged gives you the option of
retracing your steps by pressing the BACKSPACE key.
