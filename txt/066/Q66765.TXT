======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

To engage or disengage the thrust reversers, press SHIFT+U.

In early printings of the "Aircraft & Scenery Designer User's Guide," pages
68 and 74 incorrectly list SHIFT+BACKSPACE as the key combination to disengage
the thrust reversers. SHIFT+BACKSPACE pans the view for the active window.
