SUMMARY
=======

The Paintbrush application packaged with Microsoft Windows has the ability to
zoom-in; however, this feature is limited to the size of the image attribute. As
a result, if you have a 32 x 32 pixel picture and you zoom-in, Paintbrush will
only expand to the size of the image. The zoom-in square becomes proportional to
the size of the image.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To get a larger area to zoom-in, do the following:

1. Copy the whole image.

2. Reset the image attributes.

3. Start a new drawing.

4. Paste the picture onto the new drawing. Move the image away from the top-left
   corner of the Paintbrush window if you need to edit the top-left corner of
   the image.

5. From the View menu, choose Zoom In.

6. After you have completed your editing, capture the partial picture.

7. From the Edit menu, choose Copy To to save the image to a file.
