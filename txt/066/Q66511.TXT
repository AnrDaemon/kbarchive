SUMMARY
=======

MS-DOS 4.x requires that SHARE.EXE be loaded on systems with logical drives
larger than 32 megabytes (MB). This is not required for MS-DOS versions 5.0 and
later.

The file control block (FCB) file-access method assumes 32 MB or smaller logical
drives. In MS-DOS version 4.x, SHARE.EXE is loaded to change any attempted FCB
file accesses into File Handle file accesses on large logical drives. Without
SHARE.EXE, applications that attempt FCB file accesses fail. In MS-DOS versions
5.0 and later, translating FCB file accesses to File Handle accesses is
performed by the MS-DOS kernel; therefore, loading SHARE.EXE is not necessary.
