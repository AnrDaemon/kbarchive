SYMPTOMS
========

Output obtained from the Hewlett-Packard (HP) ThinkJet may split characters so
that the top half of the font and bottom half of the font do not line up.

CAUSE
=====

The ThinkJet prints the top half of the font on one printer pass, then prints
the bottom half of the font on the second pass. If the dip switch is set to
#2=down and #5=up, the printer doesn't add a carriage return to a linefeed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, set dip switches on ThinkJet. The eight switches from
left to right should be in the following configuration:

   #1,#2,#3,#4 = down     #5,#6 = up    #7,#8 = down
