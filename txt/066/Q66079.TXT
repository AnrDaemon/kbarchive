-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the debug version of Microsoft Windows version 3.0 or 3.1 without a
debugging terminal, your system may stop responding (hang) for a time, then the
following error message is displayed:

   Cannot read from device AUX: Retry/Cancel

CAUSE
=====

The debug version of Windows is designed to wait for input from an auxiliary
debugging terminal. If you don't have a debugging terminal attached to your
system, the debug version of Windows cannot function as designed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To prevent this error message, either connect a debugging terminal or reinstall
the retail version of Windows.

To reinstall the retail version of Windows, do the following:

1. From the MS-DOS command prompt, change to the Windows directory.

2. In the Windows directory, type "D2N" (without the quotation marks) and press
   the ENTER key. D2N is a batch file that converts the debug version of Windows
   into the normal version.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "debug" version of Windows is designed for the Windows Software Development
Kit. This version reports errors more readily than the retail version of
Windows. For example, bringing up the LaserJet III driver's setup screen causes
an error to appear in the debug version of Windows, but does not generate an
error in the retail version.

The error reporting mechanism used by the debug version of Windows is a "debug
terminal." This is a dumb terminal connected to the computer's AUX: port. When
Windows reports an error, it immediately sends information about the error to
the debug terminal. After Windows displays the error information, it sends a
prompt of "Abort, Break, Ignore?" to the terminal and waits for you to type an
appropriate command (A, B, or I).

If no terminal is hooked up, or the terminal is turned off, the error codes are
sent to a non-existent device. Also, you cannot type anything into the system
keyboard while Windows waits for input from the debug terminal. After a period
of time with no response from the terminal, Windows displays the "Cannot read
device AUX" error box. Choosing Cancel causes Windows to exit, and choosing
Retry causes Windows to wait until there is a response on the terminal. A Retry
command can effectively lock your system if no debug terminal is connected.
