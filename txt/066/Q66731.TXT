The Microsoft Windows version 3.0 Setup program hangs on Disk 2 if you
specify an invalid directory.

For example, if you shorten the given directory C:\WINDOWS by typing
over it and removing the remaining characters with the SPACEBAR, you
have just entered spaces to a directory name. You must delete the
remaining characters (use the DEL key).

You must use valid characters when making a directory with MS-DOS, but if
you use a space within a directory name with Windows 3.0 Setup, Windows
lets you continue and does not detect that you just made an invalid
directory. MS-DOS does not let you do this.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.0 3.0a 3.00a \* 31check - Please comment this article if it applies to later versions of Windows. NoWin4
