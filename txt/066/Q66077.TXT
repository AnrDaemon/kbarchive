SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Setup program to change the system settings in Microsoft
Windows, you may receive the following error message when you restart Windows:

   Program group file "filename" is write protected. Its icons cannot be updated
   for the new display device

In Windows 3.0, the message is preceded by

   Icon Extraction Error

In Windows 3.1, the message is preceded by

   Group File Error

This set of error messages indicates that the read-only attribute has been set
for the group file mentioned.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows groups files contain display-specific information about program icons.
If you change your display device through Windows Setup, Windows needs to update
this information to correctly display the program icons in Program Manager. This
is not possible if the group file has the read-only attribute set.

To remove the read-only attribute from a file, use the MS-DOS ATTRIB command. For
example, to remove the read-only attribute from the MAIN.GRP file, type the
following at the MS-DOS command prompt:

   attrib main.grp -r

Additional query words: 3.00 3.0 3.0a 3.00a 3.1 3.10 3.11
