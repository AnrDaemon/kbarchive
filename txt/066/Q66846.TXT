SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Flight Simulator, the 747 enhanced panel has a wind speed and
direction indicator appearing on the lower left portion of the Navigation
Display. If you have set values in the Winds menu, a wind direction and velocity
indicator will appear. The top digits display the wind direction at your current
altitude, and the bottom digits display the wind velocity. The arrow points in
the direction of the wind relative to the heading of the aircraft.

The system can detect different levels of wind. For example, if you have winds
set at surface level and between 5,000 and 8,000 feet, the arrow and
corresponding speed/direction values would be displayed while you are on the
runway, then disappear while you are above the surface level's Depth value, then
reappear when you are between 5,000 and 8,000 feet, then disappear when you are
above 8000 feet. This behavior is entirely dependent on the Winds menu values.

This feature is documented in Aircraft & Scenery Designer's README.AD1 file.
