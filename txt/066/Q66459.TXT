TITLE   :FIX: Bad Macro Substitution, In-line File in Inference Rule
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft NMAKE Utility for MS-DOS 
 - Microsoft NMAKE Utility for OS/2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using an in-line file inside of an inference rule with NMAKE version 1.11, 1.12,
or 1.13 can cause improper results in macro substitutions following the in-line
file.

STATUS
======

This problem has been fixed in NMAKE versions 1.2 and later.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following NMAKE description file produces the following output:

   cl -c test.c
   link @lrf
   cd test.exe   <---- This is wrong.   It should be "cd \test"

NMAKE: fatal error U1077: 'cd' return code 1
Stop.

The third line of the output is incorrect. The macro $(SAMPLEDIR) is incorrectly
replaced with the value of $(EXENAME).

Sample Makefile
---------------

   EXENAME=test.exe
   SAMPLEDIR=\test

   .obj.exe:
     link @<<lrf     <--- In-line file with $(EXENAME) macro
   $<                     causes the problem.
   $(EXENAME);
   <<KEEP
     cd $(SAMPLEDIR)

   test.exe:test.obj

   test.obj:test.c
