-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Lotus 1-2-3 version 3.0 does not run under Microsoft Windows or Microsoft
Windows for Workgroups in 386 enhanced mode because Lotus uses a virtual control
program interface (VCPI) compatible DOS extender rather than a DOS protected
mode interface (DPMI) compatible DOS extender. The DPMI- compatible DOS extender
is a newer industry standard that Windows and Windows for Workgroups use in 386
enhanced mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Lotus 1-2-3 3.0 uses a multitasking version of VCPI with a few other
enhancements. Many software companies have already announced plans to support
DPMI in future releases of their products. Check with your application's
manufacturer to see if it supports Windows or Windows for Workgroups 3.x, DPMI,
or both.

Lotus 1-2-3 3.0 should be run in standard mode with the following program
information file (PIF) settings:

    XMS Memory: KB Required - 2048
    XMS Memory: KB Limit    - 2048

NOTE: Windows for Workgroups 3.11 does not support standard mode.

You may want to increase the XMS Memory: KB Limit setting to include additional
XMS memory when available.

Lotus 1-2-3 version 3.1 is reported to be a DPMI version and to run in 386
enhanced mode.
