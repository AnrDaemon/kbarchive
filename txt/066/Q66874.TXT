SUMMARY
=======

Golf is a challenging solitaire card game in the Windows Entertainment Pack
(WEP1). The playing area is divided into three main regions: seven stacks of
cards are located at the top of the playing area; the deck is located in the
bottom-left hand corner of the playing area; and the discard pile is located to
the right of the deck. The object of the game is to play all the cards from the
top stacks down to the discard pile.

When the game begins, the top card in the deck is faceup on the discard pile. You
can play any card from the top of a stack down to the discard pile if its rank
is either one higher or one lower than the rank of the top card on the discard
pile. For example, you can play a 10 onto a nine, or a four onto a five. There
are two exceptions to this rule: Only a two can be played onto an ace, and no
card can be played onto a king.

The top card of the deck may also be played to the discard pile. The number of
cards remaining in the deck is indicated by the counter in the lower-left hand
corner of the playing area.

Play ends when all cards in the top seven stacks have been moved to the discard
pile or when the deck is exhausted.
