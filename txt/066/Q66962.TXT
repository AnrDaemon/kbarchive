-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

To run Microsoft Windows version 3.0 in 386 enhanced mode on a Dell 316LT,
316SX, or 320LT laptop computer, the following EMMExclude lines under the
[386ENH] section of the SYSTEM.INI file are required:

      EMMExclude = E000 - EFFF
      EMMExclude = C000 - C7FF

MORE INFORMATION
================

These high-memory page segments are used for extended video RAM and RAM BIOS
shadowing. However, the segments may appear to be free when Windows starts in
386 enhanced mode. Windows may attempt to use these memory segments while
operating, which will corrupt the video RAM or the BIOS shadowing. This may
cause UAEs, crashing, or lock-ups of the I/O devices (keyboard, mouse, and so
on).
