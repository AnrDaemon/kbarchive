SUMMARY
=======

The Taipei game in the Windows Entertainment Pack (WEP1) screen cannot be sized
with the keyboard or the mouse. The dimensions of the game screen are fixed. The
screen size is dependent on the video display driver for which Windows is
configured (that is, VGA).

For example, the game screen size is larger when EGA is selected as the display
in the Windows Setup program than when a VGA or 8514 video driver is selected.
To determine the video display for which Windows is currently configured, choose
Run from the File menu of Program Manager and type "setup" (without the
quotation marks) in the Command Line box.
