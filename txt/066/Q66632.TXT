-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Using the Microsoft FORTRAN Optimizing Compiler versions 5.0 and earlier to
compile Windows programs is not supported. The Windows SDK support is limited to
support of the Microsoft C Compiler and Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM).

To compile Windows programs, use the Microsoft FORTRAN Optimizing Compiler
version 5.1 or later. This version includes the necessary libraries to compile
code to run under Windows version 3.0 in standard and enhanced mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The FORTRAN 5.1 compiler includes support for Mixed Language application and
stand-alone QuickWin FORTRAN applications. The FORTRAN PowerStation 32- bit
compiler for MS-DOS does not include support to do mixed language programming
with any Microsoft C/C++ Windows compiler. The FORTRAN PowerStation compiler for
Windows NT does support mixed language programming for Windows NT. Mixing
support is available to mixed projects using the Visual C++ for Windows NT
compiler.

The most important reason why FORTRAN version 5.0 routines will not work under
Windows is that the FORTRAN version 5.0 run-time libraries are not designed to
communicate with Windows; they are designed for either MS-DOS or OS/2
programming. The Windows SDK includes specially modified versions of the
standard C run-time libraries that are designed for Windows programming. A
standard FORTRAN version 5.0 library, such as MLIBFORE.LIB, makes no allowances
for Windows programming.
