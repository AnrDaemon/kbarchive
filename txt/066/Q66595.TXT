SUMMARY
=======

The SetDIBitsToDevice() function will set the device-independent bitmap (DIB)
only to a physical device context, not to a memory device context. To set the
DIB to a memory device context, use SetDIBits(), or call StretchDIBits() and
specify the same height and width for both the source and the destination.

It is important to keep in mind that, on a palette device, the palette must be
set appropriately before transferring the image. The SetDIBitsToDevice() and
StretchDIBits() functions do not set the palette automatically. To do this,
perform the following steps:

1. Get the palette from the DIB.

2. Create a logical palette with the palette colors from the DIB.

3. Select the palette into the device context.

4. Realize the palette.

5. Call SetDIBitsToDevice() or StretchDIBits() to transfer the image to the
   device context.
