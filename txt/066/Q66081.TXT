SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows version 3.0 runs properly in all modes on a computer using the
OptiStar WORM driver version 4.01. OptiStar drivers, which are made by Corel
Corporation, are used on a wide variety of WORM optical drives. WORM drives
(Write Once Read Many) are SCSI host-adapter drives used for permanent storage
of data. Data is "burned" onto the removable optical disk.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Attempting to access the drive while running the driver version 3.01 under
Windows in enhanced mode returns the error "This application has violated system
integrity." Upgrading your OptiStar software to version 4.01q (or later) should
resolve this problem.
