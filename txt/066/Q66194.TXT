SUMMARY
=======

Flight Simulator checks for successive physical serial ports when selecting a
serial port above Com1. For example, to use Com4, the port must be a physical
port in the computer, and four physical ports must exist in the computer.

Logical serial ports may not be recognized correctly. For example, some internal
modems can create a logical serial port. Flight Simulator was not tested with
logical serial ports, and therefore, cannot be guaranteed to function correctly
with such hardware.
