SUMMARY
=======

Question:

   I tried to run Windows version 3.0 or 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode while using a
   3Com EtherLink Plus card. Unfortunately, Windows hung and I had to reboot my
   machine. How can I prevent Windows from hanging?

Response:

   On some systems, the 3Com EtherLink Plus card should not be allowed to
   control DMA transfers when running Windows version 3.0 or 3.1 in 386 enhanced
   mode. The following method can be used to disable the card's control of the
   DMA by adding one of the following lines to the [ELNKPL_NIF] section of the
   DOS LAN Manager version 2.0 (or later) PROTOCOL.INI file:

      ; Use this line if the card is in a 16-bit slot.
         DATATRANSFER = PIO_WORD

      ; Use this line if the card is in an 8-bit slot.
         DATATRANSFER = PIO_BYTE
