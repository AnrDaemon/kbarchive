The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, version 1.1 
 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, version 1.1

SUMMARY
=======

When setting a program list containing .ASM files in Programmer's WorkBench
(PWB) version 1.10, the following error message occurs:

   Program List: file 'filename' will be ignored
   File type unused by current build options

The .ASM files are not recognized because PWB 1.1 does not contain build switches
specific to any language. Build switches are now loaded from language extension
files (.MXT for DOS and .PXT for OS/2). If you have an assembly language
extension file, you will not see this error message. Language extensions are not
necessary and are only a convenience for controlling the build process; only the
build switches are really needed.

The sample build switches below can be added to a tagged section in your
TOOLS.INI file. To use these build options, initialize the tagged section by
typing {arg} tag_name {reinitialize}, which is equivalent to the following
keystrokes for the sample build switches below:

   ALT+A asm_rules SHIFT+F8

Note that if you are doing mixed-language programming, you should first set your
main language and initial build options from the Build Options dialog box under
the Options menu and then initialize the tagged section.

The MASM build switches can also be added to a custom set of build options saved
by Save Current Build Options. They may then be initialized by choosing Build
Options from the Options menu, and then selecting Set Initial Build Options to
choose the new custom language options.

MORE INFORMATION

Sample Build Switches
---------------------

   [pwb-asm_rules]
   ;
   ;   MASM build rules
   ;
   build:macro ASM "MASM"
   build:macro AFLAGS_G "/Mx /T"
   build:macro AFLAGS_D "/Zi"
   build:macro AFLAGS_R ""
   build:inference .asm.obj as_asm_obj
   build:release command as_asm_obj  \ 
               "$(ASM) $(AFLAGS_G) $(AFLAGS_R) $<, $@;"
   build:debug command as_asm_obj  \ 
               "$(ASM) $(AFLAGS_G) $(AFLAGS_D) $<, $@;"
   build:include .asm "^[ \t]*include[ \t]+\\([^ \t]+\\)"
   build:include .inc "^[ \t]*include[ \t]+\\([^ \t]+\\)"

These assembly flags can then be modified from PWB by using the following macros.
The macros must be assigned to keystrokes to be activated. This can be done
using the <ASSIGN> pseudo file. They can then be used to redefine the
flags to pass to MASM.

   ;
   ;   MASM option-setting macros
   ;
   setAFG:= arg "Global MASM Options?"  prompt -> cancel lasttext home \ 
           "build:macro AFLAGS_G \"" endline "\"" assign

   setAFD:= arg "Debug MASM Options?"   prompt -> cancel lasttext home \ 
           "build:macro AFLAGS_D \"" endline "\"" assign

   setAFR:= arg "Release MASM Options?" prompt -> cancel lasttext home \ 
           "build:macro AFLAGS_R \"" endline "\"" assign
