TITLE   :ASD: Flight Timing Gate Scoring

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

The timing gate feature of the Aircraft & Scenery Designer functions best
when gates are placed a fair distance apart. Closely spaced gates (for example,
1/2 mile) may give confusing statistics.

Example
-------

Time        Speed        Score
----        -----        -----
001.2       246          150
001.8       289          149

In this example, the second time is slower even though the speed is faster; this
is due to the way that time and distance are measured by Flight Simulator.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Flight Simulator measures time in 1/18-second intervals. Distance is measured
each time the screen is updated. The degree of accuracy depends on the speed of
the computer.
