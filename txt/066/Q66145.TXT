TITLE   :AutoLoad Feature in IdleWild Causes Multiple WIN.INI Entries
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

The AutoLoad feature in the screensaver IdleWild utility included in the
Microsoft Windows Entertainment Pack writes a line directly to the Load= line of
the WIN.INI file. This line (usually C:\WEP\IDLEWILD.EXE, depending on path) is
permanently written to the WIN.INI file. If IdleWild is shut down during a
Windows session, the AutoLoad feature does not stay checked. As a result, you
can reselect AutoLoad from the Options menu. This will write a second line to
the Load= line of the WIN.INI file.

This behavior does not create a problem until the 128 character limit is reached
on the Load= line. When this limit is reached, you will receive the following
error message when Windows is started:

   Cannot find file. Check to ensure the path and filename are correct.

To solve the problem, remove all excess entries from the Load= line of the
WIN.INI file.
