The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On IBM machines running the IBM DOS mouse driver version 1.0, the video display
is a shade of green or yellow. The OK and Cancel buttons appear to be "blacked"
out.


RESOLUTION
==========

The solution to this problem is to remove the mouse driver from the AUTOEXEC.BAT
or the CONFIG.SYS. If a mouse driver is needed at the MS-DOS level, the
following two choices are available:

 - Use the Microsoft Mouse driver supplied with Windows 3.x.

   --or--

 - Contact IBM for an upgrade to version 1.1.
