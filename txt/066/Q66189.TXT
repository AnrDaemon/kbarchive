======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

On the altimeter there is a smaller barometric pressure window that reads 3001.
In Flight Simulator, this window is too small to plot the digits, so the window
always reads 3001.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To adjust barometric pressure, point to the knob marked "A" and click the left
mouse button, or press A on the keyboard.

For additional information, see page 9 of the "Information Manual and Flight
Handbook."
