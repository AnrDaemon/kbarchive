SUMMARY
=======

IdleWild is a screen-saver utility for the Windows environment found in the
Windows Entertainment Pack. After a predetermined period of time, IdleWild will
blank your screen and replace it with an animated graphic of your choice. When
IdleWild blanks your screen, it does not affect the application that you have
been running. Instead, it places a patterned image on top of it.

To return to the original screen, do the following:

1. Simply move the mouse.

2. Click either of the mouse buttons.

3. Press any key.

The delay time can be anywhere from 1 minute to 654 minutes. IdleWild has seven
background options as well as a random blanker. There is also an AutoLoad
option. There are two special places on the screen: the upper right-hand corner,
which blanks the screen instantly; and the lower left-hand corner, which
temporarily makes the screen saver inactive.
