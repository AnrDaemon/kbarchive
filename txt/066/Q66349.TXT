SUMMARY
=======

The label on the 5.25-inch disk of the Windows Entertainment Pack incorrectly
states that to set up the Entertainment Pack, you should "type SETUP at the
A:> prompt."

Setup for the Windows Entertainment Pack is Windows based, and should be run from
within Windows as follows:

1. From the File menu in Program Manager, choose Run.

2. Type "A:SETUP" (without the quotation marks) in the dialog box that appears.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Windows Entertainment Pack
version 1.00.
