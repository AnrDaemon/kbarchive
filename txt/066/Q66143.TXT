The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the path with which you want to install the Microsoft Windows
Entertainment Pack is greater than 54 characters, you receive the "Setup
needs Disk #1" message and Windows no longer recognizes your Disk #1.

The only workaround is to limit the length of the path of the Windows
Entertainment Pack to 54 characters or less.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.0 3.0a 3.00a win30
