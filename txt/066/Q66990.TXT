SUMMARY
=======

The BININFO data structure used by the GETSETPAPERBINS printer escape is
incorrectly documented on page 12-31 of the Microsoft Windows SDK "Reference:
Volume 2" for version 3.0. It is also incorrectly documented in the version 3.1
online help and on page 480 in the version 3.1 "Programmer's Reference, Volume
3: Messages, Structures, and Macros" manual.

The correct structure declaration is as follows:

      typedef struct
      {

      short   BinNumber;
      short   NbrofBins;
      short   Reserved;
      short   Reserved;
      short   Reserved;
      short   Reserved;

      } BinInfo;

The Microsoft Windows Device Development Kit "Device Driver Adaptation Guide"
correctly documents this structure on page 11-29 for version 3.0 and on page 421
for version 3.1.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.10 docerr
