 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following message occurs on 3Com 3+Share networks and Microsoft Networks
(MS-Net) when you open and close Microsoft Windows version 3.0 File Manager
(WINFILE.EXE):

   System Error
   Network Error Reading Drive <x>

where "<x>" is the name of the drive.

The message dialog box has OK and Cancel buttons that work only after repeated
attempts to use them. This error occurs only if Windows is installed to run
completely off the network server.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs only if both the shared network directory and your directory
appear to be root directories, they are both in the path, and Windows is started
from your directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

Change one of the directories so it is not the root directory of the drive
letter being used.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows version 3.0.
This problem was corrected and does not occur in later versions of Windows.
