SUMMARY
=======

DropShad.exe demonstrates how to create an edit control with a "drop shadow."
The parent window of the edit control draws the drop shadow on the control's
behalf.

Microsoft Windows is not designed to allow a control to draw its own custom
border. If an application subclasses the control and draws a border during the
processing of the WM_PAINT message, the control will not be clipped properly
because the control does not determine the clipping when it draws outside its
client area.

The proper approach is to have the parent of the control draw the border during
the processing of a WM_PAINT message. In this case, Windows will perform the
appropriate clipping automatically.

The following three steps draw the drop shadow:

1. During the processing of the parent window's WM_CREATE message, the parent
   creates the edit control and sets a static variable to the edit control's
   HWND (which will be needed to draw the shadow).

2. The parent windows draws the drop shadow during the processing of a WM_PAINT
   message. The parent window uses GetWindowRect() to determine the rectangle of
   the edit control in screen coordinates. The ScreenToClient() function
   converts this data to local coordinates, then OffsetRect() offsets the
   rectangle to determine the bounds of the shadow. (The code for this step
   would go very nicely into a DrawShadow() procedure if the application had
   more than one edit control to shadow.)

3. The parent window calls Rectangle() to draw the two rectangles that create
   the drop shadow.

The width of the drop shadow, how far the drop shadow is offset from the corners
of the edit control, and the color of the brush used to paint the drop shadow
can be varied to achieve a particular control appearance.
