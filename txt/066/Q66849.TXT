SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to increase the number of static scenery objects by recording a
dynamic scenery object as stationary and saving the motionless pattern.

Steps to accomplish this are as follows:

1. Slew to the desired place and heading.

2. Press 1 (Mode).

3. Press J (Scenery Designer).

4. Press 4 (Dynamic Scenery).

5. Press C (Record Pattern).

6. Press 1 (Begin pattern recording but, remain stationary).

7. Wait a few seconds.

8. Press Y (to stop recording).

9. Press 1 (Pattern title), name the pattern, and press ENTER.

10. Press 3 (Model:) until the desired object appears.

11. Press 7 (Pattern end action) and select "Start over."

12. Press 8 (Save changes).

13. Press SPACEBAR.

Even though the object is static (motionless), it is still dynamic scenery.

The dynamic scenery file that this pattern is saved to must be active to display
the object during normal flight.

This technique is being used in the Seattle start-up scenery. The 767 that you
see parked to the right of the runway is actually dynamic scenery.
