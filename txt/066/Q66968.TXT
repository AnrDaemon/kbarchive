TITLE   :Quick Troubleshooter Cannot Open Tools Group
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Quick Troubleshooter included with Microsoft Productivity
Pack for Windows, you may receive the following error message:

   Error: Troubleshooter is unable to show your Troubleshooter Tools group.
   Switch to Program Manager and open the Troubleshooter Tools group.

CAUSE
=====

You receive this error message if you have deleted or renamed the Troubleshooter
Tools group.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the Troubleshooter Tools group has been deleted, reinstall the Productivity
Pack for Windows.

If you have changed the name of the Troubleshooter Tools group, change it back to
its original name if you want the Quick Troubleshooter to open the group
automatically. If you want the Troubleshooter Tools group to have a custom name,
you must open it yourself after starting the Quick Troubleshooter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because the Quick Troubleshooter is separate from the Program Manager, the only
way it can locate the Troubleshooter Tools group is by looking at the names of
the existing group windows or icons. It does not have access to information
internal to Program Manager, such as the group properties or the information
contained in the group file itself. For this reason, if you rename the
Troubleshooter Tools group, it cannot be automatically opened by the Quick
Troubleshooter.
