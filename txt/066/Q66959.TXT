SUMMARY
=======

To add support for a new PostScript printer from the Supplemental Driver Library
(SDL), the disk must contain a PRINTERS.INI file to display the dialog box with
the list of printers. Without the PRINTERS.INI file, the Add Printers dialog box
will continue to prompt you to insert the disk containing the new printer file
in drive A or to choose an alternate directory even though the *.WPD files are
present. The PRINTERS.INI file and WPD files must be in the same directory.

To add support for a new PostScript printer from the SDL, do the following:

1. From the Control Panel, choose Printers.

2. Select PostScript Printer from the Installed Printers list and select
   Configure.

3. Select Setup from the Printers-Configure dialog box and then select Add
   Printer.

4. You will be prompted to place the disk containing the new printer file in
   drive A. Place SDL Disk #4 (5.25" disks) or Disk #7 (3.5") in drive A and
   select OK.

5. Select the appropriate printer driver from the list and select OK.
