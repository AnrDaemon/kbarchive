SUMMARY
=======

When the Drop Out screen saver is selected in the Windows Entertainment Pack
IdleWild game on a computer running Microsoft Windows in standard or 386
enhanced mode with a Radius two-page display, the screen saver will terminate
with an Unrecoverable Application Error (UAE) as soon as the screen saver is
