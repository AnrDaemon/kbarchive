The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for Windows, versions 3.05, 4.0, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

CodeView for Windows (CVW.EXE) requires a dual monitor configuration. On most
systems, a secondary monochrome display and adapter card meet this requirement.
IBM PS/2 systems are an exception to this rule because there are currently no
monochrome cards that are compatible with the Microchannel architecture of the
PS/2. Because of this, running CVW on an IBM PS/2 system requires both an 8514/a
(PS/2 compatible) card and an 8514/a monitor, in addition to a VGA card and
monitor. Depending on the model of PS/2, the VGA adapter may be built-in, rather
than a separate card.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Owners of non-PS/2 systems may also opt for this configuration because the
resolutions available with the 8514/VGA are higher than with a color/monochrome
setup.

To use this 8514/VGA configuration, the /8 (8514/a) option must be specified when
invoking CVW. In addition, the /B (black and white) option must be used if a
monochrome VGA adapter is used.

In other words, when using a color VGA adapter, CodeView must be invoked as
follows:

   CVW /8 appname.exe

When using a monochrome VGA adapter, CodeView must be invoked as follows:

   CVW /8 /b appname.exe

The 8514/a monitor will be the Windows display and the VGA monitor will serve as
the debugging display.

Optionally, the /25, /43, or /50 options can be specified for either 25-, 43-, or
50-line mode, respectively, on the VGA debugging screen. 50-line mode is the
default.

For 80386 based systems, the SDK INSTALL program automatically adds the line
"device=windebug.386" to the [386enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file for
debugging information.

Pages 7-2 and 7-5 of the "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit Tools"
manual outline the requirements for CVW and for setting up a dual monitor
system, respectively.
