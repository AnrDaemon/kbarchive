PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

The following procedure causes the Crop Duster score window to disappear in
Flight Simulator version 4.00:

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. From the Mode menu, select option 5, Entertainment.

2. Select option 3, Crop Duster.

3. Take off and crash the airplane.

4. Press the SPACEBAR to restart Crop Duster entertainment mode.

The score window has now disappeared.

Pressing PRINT SCREEN or choosing Reset Mode from the Mode menu does NOT make the
score window reappear. The only way to make the menu reappear is to exit
entertainment mode and reenter.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Flight Simulator version 4.00. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.
