SUMMARY
=======

During setup of the Microsoft Windows Entertainment Pack, you may receive the
following error message:

   There was an error copying files to your hard drive. Please correct the
   problem, and rerun setup.

This error is caused by a copy failure to the hard drive, and is the result of
one of the following situations:

1. The hard disk is write-protected or the network subdirectory is set for
   Read-Only.

   Solution: Remove the write-protect feature on the hard disk or change network
   privileges.

2. The Windows Entertainment Pack files already exist on the hard drive and have
   a Read-Only attribute.

   Solution: Type the following command at the DOS prompt (in the appropriate
   subdirectory) and re-run the setup program:

   ATTRIB -R filename

3. There is not enough hard-disk space to continue with setup of the Windows
   Entertainment Pack.

   The setup program checks for disk space immediately after the installation
   directory is indicated (that is, C:\WINGAMES).

   If another Windows program is running in the background and is taking up
   additional hard-disk space (that is, communication software is downloading a
   file) during installation of the Microsoft Entertainment Pack, this error may
   arise.

   Solution: Free hard-disk space for the Entertainment Pack installation.
