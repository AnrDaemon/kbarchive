SUMMARY
=======

The Windows Entertainment Pack Volume 1 game Taipei is a modern, solitaire
version of the ancient oriental game Mah-Jongg. The game begins with one of
seven different configurations of tiles, with the object of the game being to
remove all of the tiles from the playing area by matching identical tiles
together.

If a tile is available to be chosen, the mouse pointer will turn into a cross
when it is positioned over that specific tile. There is a solution to every
game, and there are a total of 32,767 different configurations. Taipei gives you
the option to backup if you want to change prior moves, bring up old games by
typing in the game number, and Taipei will even give you a hint on your next
move when you press the H key.
