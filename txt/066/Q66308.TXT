The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The MS-DOS version of the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) will utilize
expanded memory to swap its own segment overlays if it detects that
expanded memory is available in the system. When PWB needs a new
overlay, the existing overlay in memory is first copied into expanded
memory. If there is not enough room in expanded memory to copy the
overlay, the least recently used overlay is discarded to make room for
it. This scheme allows most overlays to be read from expanded memory
instead of from disk.

Note that this is the only method by which PWB will take advantage of
available expanded memory, and that PWB versions 1.0 and 1.1 have no
internal provisions to make use of extended memory in any way.
