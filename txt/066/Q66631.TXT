The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft HELPMAKE Utility for MS-DOS, versions 1.7, 1.83 
 - Microsoft HELPMAKE Utility for OS/2, versions 1..4, 1.7, 1.83 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When creating a help database with HELPMAKE, new categories may be added to the
Microsoft Advisor help system for use in the QuickHelp utility. To add
selections that will appear under the QuickHelp Categories menu, use the topic
"List categories." Under the List categories topic, list the selections that
need to be added to the menu.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is a sample help file:

   File CATEGORY.TXT
   -----------------

      .context List categories
      Category1
      Category2

      .context Category1
      This is the information under the first category.

      .context Category2
      This is the information under the second category.

For the file CATEGORY.TXT shown above, the HELPMAKE command line will appear as
follows:

   helpmake /E8 /Ocategory.hlp category.txt

The choice of /E8 for partial compression is strictly arbitrary in this case, and
is shown for demonstration purposes only. The maximum compression can be
achieved by using /E15, and no compression is denoted by /E0.

When the above help database is added to the list of databases for the Advisor,
the topics "Category1" and "Category2" will be added under the Categories menu.

The items that are placed in the List categories topic should be topics that are
already defined with ".context" strings; otherwise, when the item is selected
from the Categories menu, a message will be displayed stating that the topic
could not be found.

When using HELPMAKE with the "/C" option, which preserves case sensitivity, you
must use the string "List categories" exactly. The case is important. Failure to
use the exact case for each letter will cause the Advisor to ignore the
categories you have added.
