SUMMARY
=======

If you place custom navigational aids with Flight Simulator Aircraft &
Scenery Designer (ASD), the following accuracies can be expected:

Navigational Aid      North/South      East/West
----------------      -----------      ---------
VOR                   128 meters       1 meter
ILS                   No variance      No variance
NDB                   No variance      No variance
Audible markers       128 meters       128 meters

Using the Longitude/Latitude feature may introduce additional variance due to the
complexity of the conversion algorithm. The Flight Simulator coordinate system
provides the highest degree of accuracy.


MORE INFORMATION
================

To confirm the positional accuracy of navigational aids, use the following
steps:

1. Boot Flight Simulator 4.00 with ASD.

2. Press 1 (Mode).

3. Press J (Scenery Design).

4. Press 1 (Static Scenery).

5. Press C (Add Buildings, Objects).

6. Press A (Total Length) and type 100.

7. Press ENTER.

8. Press B (Total Width) and type 100.

9. Press ENTER twice.

10. Press A (to add object).

11. Press ESC.

12. Press H (Add Navigational Aids).

13. Press 1 (to choose navigational aid).

14. Press ENTER.

15. Press A (to add Navigational aid).

16. Press ESC.

17. Press J (Edit Static Scenery).

18. Press A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and I (do NOT press H).

19. Press TAB (Find Next Object).

The navigational aid just created should be selected. Note the location of the
navigational aid in relation to the building. Knowing that the building is
100-by-100-feet square, you can estimate the placement accuracy.
