TITLE   :FIX: PWB May Exit to MS-DOS If TMP Is Set Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the TMP environment variable is set only to a drive (with no path specified),
the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) version 1.0 or 1.1 may "crash" out to MS-DOS
when a compile is attempted. The screen will still show PWB editor, but there
will be a prompt displayed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in PWB versions 1.0 and 1.1. This
problem was corrected in PWB version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To reproduce this problem, use the following procedure:

1. Set up the environment to run PWB.

2. Set the TMP environment variable to the current drive, without specifying a
   path. For example:

   SET TMP=C:

3. Execute PWB and create or load a simple source file.

4. Attempt to compile the source file. (Note: If the Compile option is not
   available on the Make menu, make sure the file has a name with a .C
   extension.)
