SUMMARY
=======

Unlike Flight Simulator, proper installation of Aircraft & Scenery Designer
(ASD) requires that you run an Install program. If the contents of the ASD Disk
are copied directly to the Flight Simulator directory, the Flight Simulator
program will appear unchanged. When properly installed, the Mode menu (1)
contains option I for Aircraft Design and option J for Scenery Design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install Aircraft & Scenery Designer on a hard disk system, do the
following:

1. Insert the ASD Disk into Drive A.

2. Type "A:" and press the ENTER key.

3. Type "install" followed by the drive and directory where Flight Simulator is
   installed on the hard disk. For example, if Flight Simulator is located in a
   directory called "fltsim4" type the following:

   " INSTALL C:\FLTSIM4 " (without the quotation marks)

To install Aircraft & Scenery Designer on a 1.2 MB, 5.25-inch disk or 1.44
MB, 3.5-inch disk, do the following:

1. Insert the Flight Simulator Disk into the high-density disk drive.

2. Insert the ASD Disk in Drive B.

3. Type "B:" and press the ENTER key.

4. Type "install" followed by the drive and directory where Flight Simulator is
   installed. For example:

   " INSTALL A:\FLTSIM4 " (without the quotation marks)

Start Flight Simulator as usual by typing "FS" in the Flight Simulator directory.
