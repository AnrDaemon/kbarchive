======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you have the Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade in the proper disk format for drive A
or B, you can install it with no special steps. For more information, query on
the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   " which and drives and getting and started " (without the quotation marks)

If the MS-DOS 5 Upgrade is in the proper format for a floppy drive on your
system, but not drive A or B, you may be able to make usable copies of the
disks. For more information, query on the following words in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   " copy and different and size and msdos and upgrade " (without the quotation
   marks)

If you have Microsoft MS-DOS (not the Upgrade), it is recommended that you obtain
the correct size disks for drive A. For more information, query on the following
words:

   " get and correct and disk and size and msdos " (without the quotation marks)

It is possible, though, in most versions of MS-DOS, to install a new version of
MS-DOS to the hard disk without booting the new version first. That is, if the
disk format is correct for drive B but not drive A, installation may still be
possible. See below for information about your particular situation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the following examples, it is assumed that MS-DOS version 3.2 is already
installed on the hard drive. However, upgrading from MS-DOS version 3.21, 3.3,
or later can be done in much the same way.

Upgrading to MS-DOS 3.21 or 3.3
-------------------------------

Boot MS-DOS 3.2 from the hard disk. Place the program disk in drive B and change
the default drive to drive B. The SYS command currently on the hard disk may now
be able to transfer the system files from the floppy disk in drive B to a blank,
formatted floppy disk in drive A. However, the boot sector on the floppy will be
the version 3.2 boot sector, and therefore, the floppy may not be bootable. Use
the SYS command on the floppy disk, not on the hard disk. For example, if the
version 3.2 SYS.COM is located in the C:\DOS directory, use the following
commands:

   B:\>c:\dos\sys a:

   B:\>copy command.com a:

Try to reboot the machine with the resulting boot disk. If the machine boots, you
can install MS-DOS on the hard disk. If the CHKDSK command verifies that the new
version of MS-DOS accesses the hard drive properly, you can place the Program
disk in drive B and enter the following command:

   " B:\>sys c: " (without the quotation marks)

to transfer the new MS-DOS system files to the hard drive. Because the new
version of SYS.COM is being used, the boot sector on the hard disk will be
updated from version 3.2 as well. If the new version of MS-DOS does not access
the hard drive properly, reformatting and/or repartitioning will be required.

Upgrading to MS-DOS 4.0 or 4.01
-------------------------------

You can use the SYS.COM on the Install disk to transfer the system files to a
floppy that can then be used to boot 4.0x. This technique can also be used to
transfer the system files to the hard disk without booting MS-DOS 4.0/4.01;
however, disk corruption can result if an OEM modified the method by which the
previous MS-DOS version accesses the hard disk.

Because the MS-DOS version 4.0/4.01 SYS.COM is being used, it will update the
boot sector on the floppy. To use the MS-DOS version 4.0/4.01 SYS command, type
the following:

   " B:\>sys a: " (without the quotation marks)

Copy COMMAND.COM to the SYS[tem] disk and reboot from the resulting boot disk. If
CHKDSK (located on the 5.25-inch Operating 1 disk or the 3.5-inch Operating
disk) verifies that you can correctly access each hard drive, then you can use
the SYS command to transfer the 4.0 system files to drive C. To do this, the
Install disk should be in drive B, and the current drive must be B. Type the
following command:

   " B>sys c: " (without the quotation marks)

Copy COMMAND.COM to drive C, delete the previous MS-DOS files, and copy the
remaining MS-DOS 4.0 files to the DOS directory.

If 4.0 does not properly access the hard drive, you will have to repartition it.

For more information on how to manually install MS-DOS version 4.0, query on the
following words:

   " prod(msdos) and select and manually and how " (without the quotation marks)
