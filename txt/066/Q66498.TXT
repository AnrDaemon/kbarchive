SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Productivity Pack for Windows Setup program is MS-DOS based, not
Windows based. It cannot be run from inside Windows or from MS-DOS Prompt under
Windows. To install the Productivity Pack, first exit Windows completely.

To run Setup, do the following:

1. If you have 5.25-inch disks, switch to the drive containing Setup Disk 1. If
   you have 3.5-inch disks, switch to the drive containing Setup Disk 1 and
   Setup Disk 2.

2. From the MS-DOS command prompt of that drive, type "setup" (without the
   quotation marks).

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you type "a:setup" from the MS-DOS command prompt on drive C, the

   Bad Command or File Name

error message is generated.

If you attempt to run the Productivity Pack for Windows Setup program from inside
Windows, your system will do the following:

1. Attempt to start the Setup program on the disk and fail.

2. Scan your hard drive for a Windows program named Setup.

3. Find the Windows Setup utility.

NOTES
-----

If you attempt to run the Productivity Pack for Windows Setup program from
Windows, you will instead be offered the dialog box where you can change your
device driver settings for Windows.

Running the Productivity Pack for Windows Setup program from MS-DOS under Windows
may appear to work correctly. However, it can cause incorrect or corrupted
installations of the Productivity Pack.

The correct instructions are included on the disk label and in the "Set up &
Learn" documentation included with the Productivity Pack for Windows. If the
instructions are followed precisely, there should be no problems with
installation.
