======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSN Companion, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When new e-mail arrives, the e-mail indicator light does not turn on.

CAUSE
=====

There are two ways that the MSN Companion notifies you of new e-mail: the pop-up
notification at the bottom of the screen, and the e-mail light.

Neither of these will trigger if you are currently looking at your e-mail screen.
In order for these to come on, you must be looking at the Start page, other MSN
Companion pages, or other Web pages.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Make certain that new e-mail arrived when you are not looking at the e-mail
   page.

2. Confirm that this is not a software problem:
   a. Compose a quick e-mail to yourself.

   b. Right after you send the e-mail, go right to the Start page before it
      arrives.

   c. Wait on the Start page until the e-mail arrives.

   d. When the e-mail arrives, a notification message will pop up near the
      bottom of the screen. If this notification pop-up appears, then you know
      that the software notifications are working, and this is not a software
      problem.

3. If the notification pop-up appeared but the e-mail light under the screen
   never lit up, then it's a hardware failure. Contact the manufacturer or the
   retail store for a replacement.
