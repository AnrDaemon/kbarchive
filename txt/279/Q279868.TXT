TITLE   :Using Reserved Names as the Site Code in SMS 2.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0,2.0 SP1,2.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0, you can use the following
names as your site code:

   AUX
   CON
   NUL
   PRN

However, these names are reserved in Microsoft Windows NT; using them causes
functionality problems in SMS 2.0. For example, you may not be able to set up
SMS logon servers correctly because the site folder cannot be created properly.


CAUSE
=====

Because AUX, CON, NUL, and PRN are reserved names in Windows NT, you cannot
create folders with these names.
