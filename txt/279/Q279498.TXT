TITLE   :SMS Sender Reschedules Send Request with No Instruction File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0,2.0 SP1,2.0 SP2,2.0 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbScheduler kbsms200preSP4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the SMS_LAN_SENDER component receives a send request from the Scheduler
tool, it does not determine whether there is a valid instruction file in the
Schedule.box\Tosend folder before trying to send the package file. After sending
the package file, SMS_LAN_SENDER tries to send the instruction file. If the file
does not exist, SMS_LAN_SENDER reschedules the send request to try again later.

This can cause the package file to be resent to the destination site without a
corresponding instruction file, and a zero-byte file to be created on the
destination site. If the package file is large, this could quickly consume the
drive space on a remote site.

==========
