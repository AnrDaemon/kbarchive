PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.2 SP3,1.2 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbClient kbConfig kbServer kbsms120 kbsms120bug kbAudit kbInventory kbMaintMan kbPackag

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2 SP3, 1.2 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you create a secondary site with Systems Management Server (SMS) 1.2
Service Pack 3 or Service Pack 4, the following fields may be blank in the
Sms.ini file of the site and any new clients:

 - Site

 - Domain

 - CurrentLogonServer

 - Server1

Because of this, Audit packages may not work as the site and domain entries are
evaluated during the audit. However, the Domain.ini file on the site and the
Sms.new file on the client contain the correct information.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused when the client does not populate the SITE and DOMAIN
entries in the Sms.ini file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

1. Manually stop and then restart the SMS_INVENTORY_AGENT_NT Service of the
   secondary site server.

2. While you are logged on locally to the secondary site server, map a drive
   letter to a logon server, and then run Upgrade.bat.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
