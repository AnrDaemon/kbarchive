TITLE   :PRB: Overlocalized Sort Order Strings in Access/Jet ODBC Driver

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for Access, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components versions 2.1, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In a SQLConfigDataSource ODBC function call, the Microsoft Access/Jet 4.0 ODBC
driver allows you to specify a sort order as part of the CREATE_DB attribute,
where <sort order> might be General, Arabic, Czech, Japanese, Russian, and
so on. The CREATE_DB attribute has the following format:

   CREATE_DB=<path name> <sort order>

For example:

   CREATE_DB=C:\\LocTest.mdb Czech

When you use a localized version of Jet, a sort order that is specified in
English fails; however, a sort order that is specified in the localized language
succeeds.

For example, a German localized version of the Jet ODBC driver needs to use
Allgemein, Arabisch, Tschechisch, Japanisch, Russisch, and so on, as the sort
order value.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Access offers a localized list of sort orders to use when you create a
new database. To change this setting in Access, on the Tools menu, click
Options, and then click the General tab. In the New database sort order box,
click the language that you want to use.

The Jet 4.0 ODBC driver incorrectly uses this localized list of sort orders to
verify sort languages while it creates a new database file. This means that
applications that use the CREATE_DB option with the SQLConfigDataSource ODBC
function to create new databases with a specific sort order will fail, unless
the localized version of the sort order language is provided.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Microsoft Data
Access Components (MDAC) version 2.5. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q267307 MDAC 2.5 Service Pack 1 Is Included with Windows 2000 Service Pack 1

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in MDAC 2.5 Service Pack 1 (SP1), which is also
included with Microsoft Windows 2000 SP1.

MORE INFORMATION
================


This problem has been resolved by adding another function to the Jet Sorting
Library dynamic-link library (DLL), Mswstr10.dll, which presents the sort order
languages in English. The Jet 4.0 ODBC driver has also been modified so that it
calls this new function. For this reason, the MDAC 2.5 SP1/Microsoft Windows
2000 SP1 version of the Jet ODBC driver (Odbcjt32.dll, version 4.0.5303.1) must
have the matching version of Mswstr10.dll (4.00.3829.2) on the computer or it
will fail to load.

This modified version of the Jet Sorting Library DLL is also installed with
Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) , but the ODBC driver is not
installed. Therefore, a computer may have the updated Mswstr10.dll file without
having MDAC 2.5 SP1 or Windows 2000 SP1 installed. If you need to determine
which version of MDAC is on the computer, other files such as Msado15.dll or
Oledb32.dll should be used instead.

Note that the MDAC 2.5 RTM version of the Access/Jet ODBC driver (4.0.4403.2)
will continue to call into the localized sort order function even if the newer
Jet Sorting Library DLL exists on the computer. It is necessary to install the
MDAC 2.5 SP1 version of the driver (4.0.5303.1) in order to completely correct
this problem.

Starting with Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) version 2.6, MDAC no longer
contains the following Jet components:

 - Microsoft Jet
 - Microsoft Jet OLE DB Provider
 - ODBC Desktop Database Drivers

The "MDAC 2.5 Stack and Windows File Protection" white paper contains a full list
of the components that are shipped with MDAC 2.5, along with a discussion of
Windows File Protection. Refer to this white paper for more information about
the Jet dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are included in MDAC 2.5, which are
no longer a part of MDAC 2.6.
