TITLE   :MSN Companion Troubleshooting Tool MURMUR
PRODUCT :The Microsoft Network
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSN Companion, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

MSN Companion has several secret codes that give access to special
troubleshooting information on the device, or that perform special
troubleshooting actions.

The MURMUR code removes all of the current user information and resets the device
so that the customer can enter in a new Member ID.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When should I use the MURMUR code?
----------------------------------

MURMUR should only be used in very specific circumstances:

 - Clearing the Member ID from the MSN Companion in order to use a different
   Member ID.
    - Example: you were given a device that had already been set up and used by
      someone else. You need to reset the device, deleting all of the previous
      user's information before you can enter in your Member ID.

    - Example: For some reason you need to create a new account, giving you a
      new Member ID. In order to switch the MSN Companion to this new Member ID,
      you will need to use MURMUR to reset the device and run through its setup
      screens again.

 - Re-running the initial setup screens.


When should I not use the MURMUR code?
--------------------------------------

 - Do not use MURMUR as a catch-all remedy to fix problems that can't easily be
   diagnosed. This is strongly discouraged. Since MURMUR resets all of the
   device's settings, it will remove your current user information and will
   delete all of your Favorites.

 - MURMUR should especially never be used for the following. There are much
   easier ways to fix these:
    - Resetting or changing passwords. (See Q272491 - How to change passwords
      with MSN Companion)

    - Resetting or changing dialing settings. (See Q274364 - MSN Companion
      Troubleshooting Tool HAMMER)

    - Any other problem that doesn't involve switching to a new Member ID. (See
      Q272545 - Contacting Member Support for MSN Companion)

How do I enter the MURMUR code?
-------------------------------

1. Turn on the MSN Companion and immediately click do not connect.

2. On the main troubleshooting page click I have some other problem that isn't
   described above.

3. In the text entry box type murmur and click Go.

4. The MSN Companion will now delete all current user information and will
   restart, returning to the initial setup screens.
