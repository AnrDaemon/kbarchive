TITLE   :XFOR: Japanese Characters in Subject Line Are Question Marks
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5 SP2,5.5 SP3,5.5 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2 exc55sp3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3, 5.5 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you migrate from a Lotus cc:Mail archive to a Microsoft Outlook personal
folder (.pst) file by using the Japanese-language version of the Microsoft
Importer for Lotus cc:Mail Archives (Ccmarch.exe), the Japanese characters in
the subject line may be replaced with question marks (???).

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the code page that is used in the translation
function is not correct, which renders Japanese characters unreadable. The
unreadable Japanese characters are displayed as question marks (???) in the
subject line of the message.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to

testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
