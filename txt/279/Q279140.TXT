PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp600 kbXBase kbDSupport kbCodeSnippet kbVS600sp5 kbVS600sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you call the ALINES function with an empty string, Visual FoxPro 6.0
increments the number of memory handles by one.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the latest service pack for
Visual Studio 6.0.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Run the following code from a program (.prg) file:

   Local lni
   For lni = 1 to 10
   	local array laTest[1]
   	=alines(laTest, '')
   	_Calcmem = lni  && store counter to survive clear all
   	Clear all
    	?SYS(1011), int(_calcmem)
   	Local lni
   	lni = _calcmem
   Endfor
   RETURN

After the code runs, two numbers appear. The first column indicates the memory
handles as reported by SYS(1011). The second number indicates the iteration of
the loop. Note that Visual FoxPro adds one handle per iteration.
