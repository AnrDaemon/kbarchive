======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSN Companion, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the MSN Companion tries to browse to http://hotmail.com you don't see the
regular Hotmail home page. Instead, you may get either a irrelevant log-in page,
or a page that tells you that you need WebTV or a compatible browser (IE4 or
IE5).

CAUSE
=====

Hotmail currently does not recognize the MSN Companion as a supported browser.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is currently no resolution to this. The Hotmail team is working to fix
this shortly.
