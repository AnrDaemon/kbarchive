TITLE   :XFOR: Exchange SNADS Connector Shuts Down with 22096 Event
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Connector for SNADS may shut down. When you use the
Exchange Connectivity Administrator to view the Connectivity Controller log, the
following error message may be reported:

   2000/09/28 13:19:12-LME-SNADS-MEXDIA(00d4)
   4 04103:Queue snads.in depth threshold has reached the maximum number
   specified. Current 128, Maximum 60

In addition, the following event may be reported in the application event Log in
Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 22096
   Source: MSExchangeSNADS
   Category: Transport from SNADS

   Queue threshold exceeded. Suspending SNA Link. Please reduce disk usage.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the queue depth for messages has reached its maximum
level. When the Exchange SNADS Connector reaches its threshold for messages, the
service is designed to shut down.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the issue, increase the "qdepththreshold" entry in the Exchconn.ini
file. This file is located in the Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn folder. Modify the
section labeled "[QM]".

The following text is an example of the section that you need to edit. Notice
that the current "qdepththreshold" entry is set to 500:

   [QM]
   ; baditemthreshold =
   ; qdepththreshold = 500
   ; itemagethreshold =
   ; qspacethreshold =
   ; qroot =
   ; quickscan =
   ; pollinterval =
   ; version =
   ; maxhopcount =
   ; maxretrycount =
   ; ROUTER parameters.

After you increase this setting, restart the MSExchange Connectivity Controller
and the Exchange SNADS Connector for the changes to take effect.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After the Exchange SNADS Connector service quits and the errors are reported,
you must manually restart the service.
