======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When environment variable data is collected by using the Systems Management
Server (SMS) 2.0 Hardware Inventory process, the SMS Hardware Inventory agent
truncates any string that is more than 260 characters long. If the resulting
string is truncated such that it ends with an odd number of backslashes (\) in
the hardware inventory (MIF) file, the Inventory Dataloader component on the
site server does not add that computer's hardware inventory information to the
SMS database.

CAUSE
=====

Depending on how the environment variable data is truncated, a MIF file that
contains incorrect syntax may be created. For string data in a MIF file, a
backslash (\) must be represented as two backslashes (\\) to be processed
correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid this problem, adjust the environment variables on the computers that
are affected, or disable the Win32_Environment class in the Sms_def.mof file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs only if the default hardware inventory is changed to include
the Win32_Environment class. For additional information about changing the
default hardware inventory collection criteria, refer to the "Modifying the
Sms_def.mof File" section in the online SMS Administrator's Guide.

The environment variable that is most often affected by this problem is the
system PATH variable. However, other environment variables that are created by
installed programs can also cause this behavior as well.

When the Hardware Inventory agent truncates the data, it records the following
text in the Hinv32.log file:

   CLASS - Process Class: Win32_Environment
   WARNING - Truncate attribute VariableValue of Win32_Environment.

Later, when the Inventory Dataloader component attempts to process the computer's
inventory file, it produces this syntax error message:

   Processing file H2WOUU0W.MIF
   Compilation failed~syntax error on line 42, token '~~'
   Could not convert file: F:\SMS\inboxes\dataldr.box\process\XH2WOUU0W.MIF
