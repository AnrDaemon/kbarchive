To move the route that Exchange Server uses from directory replication, follow
the procedure in this section.

delete the directory replication connection.

1. On the File menu, click New, point to Other, and then click Site connector to
   create a site connector to a remote site.

2. Click the Target Servers tab, add a server in the remote site, and then
   assign a corresponding cost to the server.

3. Open the Internet Mail Service properties, click the Connected Sites tab, and
   then delete the reference to the remote site.

4. Restart the Internet Mail Service.

5. Click to expand the Site Configuration container, open the Site Addressing
   properties, click the Routing tab, and then recalculate routing.
