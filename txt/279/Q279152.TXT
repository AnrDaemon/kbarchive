MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 534: Incorrect Information About Advertisement Start Time
--------------------------------------------------------------

On page 534, the first paragraph contains incorrect infomation about
advertisement start time.

Change:
"By default, the advertisement will be made available in all time zones at the
same time, meaning that if the advertisement start time is 3:00 in New York, it
is made available in New York at 3:00, in Chicago at 2:00, in London at 8:00,
and so on. If you want the advertisement to be made available at a specific hour
in each time zone - for example, at 3:00 in New York, Chicago, and London, check
the Greenwich Mean Time check box."

To:
"By default, the advertisement will be made available at the local time within
the client's time zone, meaning that if the advertisement start time is 3:00 in
New York, it is made available in New York at 3:00, in Chicago at 3:00, in
London at 3:00, and so on. If you want the advertisement to be made available at
an absolute time independent of time zone, check the Greenwich Mean Time check
box."
