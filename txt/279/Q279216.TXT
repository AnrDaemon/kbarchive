SUMMARY
=======

This article descries how Notes invitation calendar messages that are not yet
accepted are migrated.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you run the Migration wizard, and the Schedule Information option is the only
option that is selected, the wizard does not migrate the Notes invitation
calendar messages that are not yet accepted. If you click to select the
"Personal E-Mail Messages" option, these calendar messages are migrated to the
Inbox folder instead of the Calendar folder.

The Notes invitation calendar messages that are not yet accepted are listed with
a Notice value in the Notes Form properties.
