PROD/VER::7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft DirectX Software Development Kit, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the DirectX Diagnostic Tool (Dxdiag.exe), the following files may
be listed as the "Debug" version of the files on the DirectX Files tab:

 - D3d8d.dll
 - D3dx8d.dll
 - Dinput8d.dll
 - Dmbandd.dll
 - Dmcompod.dll
 - Dmimed.dll
 - Dmloaded.dll
 - Dmscripd.dll
 - Dmstyled.dll
 - Dmsynthd.dll
 - Dmusicd.dll
 - Dswaved.dll

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if you uninstall the Microsoft DirectX Software Development
Kit (SDK), and then install the Microsoft DirectX Runtime program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Notes section on the DirectX Files tab contains a recommendation that you
reinstall DirectX to correct the issue. However, if you reinstall DirectX, the
files are not updated. In addition, the "Debug" files function correctly after
you install the DirectX Runtime program.

NOTE: Most of the "Debug" files are not used by the retail version of DirectX.

Additional query words: direct-x dxdiag dx7 dxsdk
