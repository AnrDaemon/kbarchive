TITLE   :XIMS: Exchange Server Cannot Communicate with IIS over SSL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Internet Information Server (IIS) SMTP Service does not recognize the
STARTTLS command that the Exchange Server 5.5 computer issues. The SMTP Protocol
log on the Exchange Server computer shows that Exchange Server is giving the
STARTTLS command. Next, the IIS SMTP Service responds with "220 SMTP server
ready" (which is normal). Exchange Server follows by issuing the MAIL FROM
command to IIS. IIS immediately generates errors by returning a "505 Must issue
a STARTTLS command first" error. Then Exchange Server issues a QUIT command, and
the IIS SMTP Service closes the connection. The first message that is sent from
an Exchange Server computer and forwarded to the IIS SMTP Service generates a
non-delivery report (NDR). A second message sent from the same Exchange Server
computer and forwarded to the same SMTP Service goes through. This problem does
not occur until the 128-bit encryption is enabled on the IIS 4.0 Default SMTP
Site Properties page on the SMTP Service.
