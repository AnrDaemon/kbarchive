MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 55: Incorrect Explanations For Figure 3-4
----------------------------------------------

On page 55, the last paragraph contains incorrect explanations for Figure 3-4.

Change:
"There are actually three parts to each specific instance entry in Figure 3-4.
The first part is always the process name, cidaemon in this case. The second
part is the number of the thread for that process. As you can see, cidaemon has
at least three threads running (0, 1, and 2). The number following the pound
sign (#) is the number of the processor. This is a dual processor machine. If
you don' see a processor number, the instance refers to the first processor in
the machine. In other words, there's an instance for each thread and for each
processor that the thread can run on."

To:
"There are actually three parts to each specific instance entry in Figure 3-4.
The first part is always the instance name, cidaemon in this case. The second
part is the object instance for that thread. As you can see, cidaemon has at
least three threads running (0, 1, and 2). The number following the pound sign
(#) is the instance index. The instance index allows you to track child
instances. The operating system configures System Monitor properties to display
duplicate instances by default. Instance index 0 is hidden; numbering of
additional instances starts with 1."


Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
