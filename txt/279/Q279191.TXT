OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe600 kbSSafe600fix kbAnalyze kbDSupport kbGrpDSSSafe kbVS600sp5fix kbSSafeAnalyze

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Analyze.exe utility that is included in Visual SourceSafe (VSS) does not
remove orphaned files from the database. When you run Analyze.exe, one of the
following error messages may appear:

   The project Web-templates contains a child that does not recognize this
   project as a parent. The child will be added to the project.

   -or-

   Project log 'physical file' has a create record for item [file name], but
   that item wasn't found in the project.

   -or-

   The project name references a child whose physical file [file name] is
   missing or corrupted.

CAUSE
=====

The abnormal ending of the VSS process can cause orphaned files. This
abnormality can stem from many different situations, including power loss during
file transfer, network traffic, drive runs out of space, and so forth.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the latest service pack for

1. Delete and purge a large project from a VSS database by checking the Destroy
   Permanently checkbox.

2. While the destroy process runs, stop the process in Task Manager
   (CTRL+ALT+DELETE), or turn the computer off (to simulate a power failure).

3. Run Analyze.exe, and note that the error messages in the "Symptoms" section
   that refer to lost parent or child links occur.
