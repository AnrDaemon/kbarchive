TITLE   :No Method of Installation for Internet Connector Licensing
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

For Internet sites that use server-based authentication, you may purchase a
Windows 2000 Internet Connector license as an alternative to individual Windows
2000 Client Access Licenses (CALs). The license allows an unlimited number of
authenticated Internet users to access a single Microsoft Windows 2000 server.
After you purchase the license, you see that no configuration option exists to
activate the new license.

WORKAROUND
==========

Because no method exists to distinguish between an authenticated Internet user
and an authenticated Intranet user, there is no way to filter users out to
comply with the licensing agreement. To switch to per seat licensing, use the
following steps:

1. Open Control Panel and open the Licensing applet.

2. In the Product box, click Windows Server.

3. For the licensing mode, select Per Seat.

NOTE: You have only one chance to change from per server to per seat.
