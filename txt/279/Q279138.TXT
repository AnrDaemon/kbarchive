PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbvfp600 KbDBFDBC kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbCodeSnippet kbVS600sp5 kbVS600sp5f

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SQL Passthrough does not map SQL_WLONGVARCHAR fields that are longer than 255
characters from Microsoft SQL Server to memo field types in Visual FoxPro.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the latest service pack for
Visual Studio 6.0.

   Q194295 HOWTO: Tell That a Visual Studio Service Pack Is Installed

Microsoft Web site:

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

Run the following from the Command window.

NOTE: You need to provide the actual servername, user identification, and
password for your installation of SQL Server.

   nConnection = SQLSTRINGCONNECT("driver=SQL 
   Server;Server=servername;UID=sa;pwd=;database=Northwind")
   ? SQLEXEC(nConnection, "select * from customers where customerid='CACTU'
   for xml auto,elements", "cust_xml")
   BROWSE NOWAIT
   SQLDISCONNECT(nConnection)

After you run the code, the results appear in a cursor with one 255-character
column. Because the size of this particular field is approximately 351
characters, Visual FoxPro should return the results to a memo field.
