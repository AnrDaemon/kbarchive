TITLE   :CTL on Destination Node Does Not Work after Replicatication
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCOMIS kbWin2000sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Cluster Server (MSCS) uses Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0, and
the administrator creates a Client Trust List (CTL) on Node A, and then runs
IISSYNC for metabase replication from Node A to Node B, the property changes are
replicated, but the CTL is not. If a CTL is already in place on Node B before
the replication, IISSYNC replaces the CTL with a null value.

CAUSE
=====

Each CTL has a GUID and is computer specific. Even though IISSYNC replicates
this GUID, the second node does not have a CTL associated with it.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
additional information, click the following article number to view the article

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or

   5/31/2001  03:31p  5.0.2195.3649  26896   Mdsync.dll    Intel


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Internet Information Services
(IIS) 5.0. This problem was first corrected in Windows 2000 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This fix prevents any replication in respect to the CTL, so that a CTL that
exists on the destination node before the replication will still work after the
metabase replication runs.
