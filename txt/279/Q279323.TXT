SUMMARY
=======

If you use the "Forward all messages to host" option to deliver outbound Simple
Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) messages, you can configure the Exchange Internet
Mail Service so that it sends messages to multiple hosts.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you configure the Internet Mail Service for multiple hosts, use a comma to
separate the names of the hosts that you want the Internet Mail Service to
forward mail to. For example:

   "<host1>,<host2>,<host3>" (without the quotation marks)

SMTP messages are then delivered in a round-robin style. The first message is
sent to <host1>, the second message is sent to <host2>, the third
message is sent to <host3>, the fourth message is sent to <host1>,
and so on. Use the IP address rather than the computer name for the best
performance.

If one of the hosts is unavailable, outbound messages are not queued up for this
host. Messages are delivered only to the available hosts on the list.
