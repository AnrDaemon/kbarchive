TITLE   :XCLN: Switching Views on a Replicated Public Folder Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to change views on a Microsoft Exchange Public Folder (PF) that
is a replica from another Microsoft Exchange Server and it contains a form that
uses named properties, the following error message might appear:

   The view could not be applied. Client operation failed. Microsoft Exchange
   Information Store 1281 [8004005:000004FA]"

CAUSE
=====

Some restrictions that have named properties fail to be loaded when the
restriction is replicated to another Microsoft Exchange Server. The failure is
due to the comment node in the restriction being lost that contains the mapping
of the named properties to the ids.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange clients,
version 4.0, listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected
in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S. Service Pack 4. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
