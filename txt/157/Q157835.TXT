PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The information in this article applies to the 
German version(s) of Windows NT 4.0.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a Microsoft Excel workbook by right-clicking the desktop, pointing
to New, and then clicking Microsoft Excel Workbook, an English Excel workbook is
opened instead of a German Excel Workbook.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Windows NT copies an English Excel.xls file in the
%SystemRoot%\ShellNew folder. The files in this folder are used when you
right-click a document and then click New.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, complete the steps below. You must be a local
administrator to perform these steps:

1. Start Excel from the Start menu. This will open a German Excel workbook.

2. Save this workbook as Excel.xls and close Excel.

3. In Windows Explorer, copy the file to the %SystemRoot%\ShellNew folder.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
