PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbualink97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A paragraph formatted with a negative indent does not display the negative
indent in online layout view; however, Word allows you to set a negative indent
while in online layout view.

WORKAROUND
==========

The document prints correctly, but to display the negative indent correctly you
must switch to normal view, page layout view, or print preview.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Word 97 for Windows provides a new document viewing option called
online layout view. This view optimizes the layout to make online reading
easier. Text appears larger and wraps to fit the window, rather than the way it
actually prints.

To switch to online layout view, on the View menu, click Online Layout.
