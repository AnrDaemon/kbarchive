   of additional space. Also, additional hard disk space is required for
   creating documents.

   CD-ROM at 300 KB per second while using less than 40 percent of the CPU

   CD-ROM Extensions (MSCDEX) version 2.2 or later.

 - Sound requirements (optional): Windows-compatible 8-bit sound card capable of
   playing wave sound effects and MIDI music. Speakers or headphones.

 - Internet requirements: To send e-mail packages, you need an e-mail account
   with an Internet service provider. You also need a separate e-mail program
   that supports file attachments.

   To post web pages, you need an Internet account that supports the posting of
   personal web pages. This means your account provider must provide space for
   you to copy files to a server that is accessible to the Internet. Contact
   your Internet service provider and ask whether your account supports the
   posting of personal web pages.

For more information on Internet requirements for e-mail and web publishing, see
the Readme.doc file on the CD-ROM.
