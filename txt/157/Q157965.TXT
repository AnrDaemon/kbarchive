======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


The Systems Management Server inventory agent reports inventory every logon, even
though the inventory scan interval is one day. For more information on this
problem, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q151620 Inventory Scan Intervals Off by One Day

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by the failure of the inventory agent to take leap years
into account. Therefore, the problem is evident from 02/29/1996 to 12/31/1996.
Since 1997 is not a leap year, the inventory agent will behave normally.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do either of the following:

 - To specify daily scans, type "Every 2 Days." (without the quotation marks)

 - To specify scans every three days or less frequently, type the interval as
   you normally would.

NOTE: This problem prevents you from specifying an interval of two days.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft
Systems Management Server version 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   " SERVPACK" (without the quotation marks)
