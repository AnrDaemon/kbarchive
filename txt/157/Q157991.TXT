KEYWORDS:kbgraphic word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click Picture on the Insert menu, you may notice the following
behavior:

 - Clip art is missing as a menu selection.

 - Selecting Clipart brings up an empty Clipart Gallery.

 - Clip art pictures are not available from the Microsoft Office\Clipart folder.
   Note that there will be a shortcut in the Clipart folder to access the clip
   art files from the CD-ROM.

CAUSE
=====

When you install Office or Word, you have a choice of the type of installation
you want to use: Typical, Custom, or Run from CD-ROM. If you choose Run from
CD-ROM or if you choose Custom and clear the Clipart or Popular Clipart check
boxes, you will encounter one of the symptoms listed at the beginning of this
article.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use the following steps.

To install Popular Clipart and Clipart Gallery
----------------------------------------------

1. Quit Word and Office.

2. Click the Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

3. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

4. Click the Install/Uninstall tab.

5. In the list of installed software, select either Microsoft Word 97 or
   Microsoft Office 97. Then, click Add/Remove.

   The Setup program will be started.

6. From the Setup screen, click Add/Remove.

7. Select Office Tools (do not clear the check box if it contains a check mark),
   and then click the Change Option button.

8. Select Popular Clipart or Clipart Gallery, and then click OK.

9. Click Continue.

Follow the instructions to complete the steps in the Setup program.

To install Microsoft Clipart Extra
----------------------------------

Use the following steps if you want to install the additional clip art files to
your local hard disk drive. This procedure adds up to 180 megabytes (MB) of
additional clip art files to your drive. These clip art files are available from
the shortcut Clipart on the Office CD available in the Clipart directory. The
shortcut makes the clip art files available to you, but it does not install the
clip art files to your hard disk drive.

Method 1: Use the Control Panel to Run Clipart Setup

1. Quit Word or Office.

2. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

3. From Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.

4. Click the Install/Uninstall tab, and then click Install.

5. Follow the instructions in the Install Program wizard and click Next.

   The Install Program should search for the drive containing the Setup program.
   Click Browse.

6. Change the Look In to the appropriate drive, if needed (for example, D:).
   Then change to the Clipart folder. Double-click Setup (Setup.exe).

NOTE: The Office97 CD contains a special Setup program designed to ease the
process of adding all of the extra clip art available on the Office97 CD. The
following instructions pertain to the Microsoft Clipart Extra Setup program. You
will also need up to 180 MB of additional disk space to install all of the extra
clipart and multimedia files.

Method 2: Run Clipart Setup Directly from the CD

1. Quit Word and Office.

2. Insert the Office 97 CD in the disc drive.

3. Click Start, and then click Run.

4. In the Open box, type

   <drive>:\clipart\setup.exe

   where <drive> is the letter for your CD drive.

5. To install all clip art, click Custom, and then follow the instructions in
   the Setup program.
