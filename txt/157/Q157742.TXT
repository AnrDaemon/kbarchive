KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbother kbProgramming

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run 16-bit Windows applications on Windows NT, these programs can use
up memory by requesting and never releasing memory. This problem may occur if
that application makes a call to the Killtimer() API. This problem only occurs
in Windows NT 4.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

Stop the Windows on Windows (WOW) application using either Task Manager or
Pviewer.exe.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
