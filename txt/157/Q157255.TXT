TITLE   :DOCERR: About _Coverage Wrong in Documentation and Help
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Visual FoxPro 5.0 Language Reference, Help, and online Language Reference
provide incorrect information about the "_COVERAGE" system variable.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The topic "_COVERAGE" in the Visual FoxPro Help file and in the Language
Reference in the Online Documentation provide the following information:

   Contains the name of the Visual FoxPro application that creates the Debugger
   coverage and profiler output.

   By default, _COVERAGE contains Coverage.app, installed in your Visual FoxPro
   directory. You can specify a different name for the coverage output
   application.

However, issuing either of the following commands in the Command window results
in an empty string.

      ? _COVERAGE
      ? SET("COVERAGE")

A file called Coverage.app does not exist in any of the directories installed by
Visual FoxPro.

A default coverage application, Coverage.app, does not exist. The _COVERAGE
system variable is not assigned any application by default, but one can be
assigned to it. This variable allows you to create your own coverage application
and make it callable from Visual FoxPro.
