TITLE   :XADM: PerfOpt Does Not Check for Sufficient Disk Space
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Performance Optimizer to analyze drives and suggest which drives
the databases should be moved to, Performance Optimizer does not check for
sufficient disk space before suggesting a drive. Sometimes the move to a
location suggested by Performance Optimizer is unsuccessful because of
insufficient disk space.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
