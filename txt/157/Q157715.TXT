TITLE   :PRB: VSS OLE Add-in Model Not Supported by Visual Basic 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbSSafe500 kbVBp400

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When creating an add-in OLE server with Visual Basic 4.0, Visual SourceSafe may
crash or may not register the add-in properly.

CAUSE
=====

Visual Basic 4.0 does not support creating OLE interfaces. This is required by
the OLE automation add-in model in order to create an add-in OLE server.

RESOLUTION
==========

A language that supports OLE interfaces, such as Microsoft Visual C++, should be
used.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Visual SourceSafe add-in model expects an IVSSEventHandler interface that
has an INIT event exposed. If this interface is not available, Visual SourceSafe
cannot establish the communication channel between itself and the add-in OLE
server.
