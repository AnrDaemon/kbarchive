SYMPTOMS
========

During the normal use of a computer system with the SMC9232 10/100 network
interface card (NIC) installed running Windows NT, the computer fails with
multiple STOP messages. The computer may fail with any or all of the following
three STOP messages:

 - The following STOP errors message appears on your Windows NT Server:

   STOP: 0x0000000A (0x00000034, 0x00000002, 0x00000001, 0x80402DA6)

   NOTE: The first, second, and third parameters will be identical.

 - The following STOP errors message appears on your Windows NT Server:

   STOP: 0x0000001E (0xC0000005, 0x8017A7E4, 0x00000000, 0x00100048)

   NOTE: The first parameter will be identical; other parameters may vary
   depending on your system configuration.

 - The following STOP errors message appears on your Windows NT Server:

   STOP: 0x00000046 (0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)

   NOTE: All of the parameters will be the same.

CAUSE
=====

The version of the SMC driver that is failing is the version for Windows NT
3.51, the Smc9232n.sys version 1.01 dated 3-6-96. Currently, SMC is aware that
the Smc9232n.sys may be causing this problem, and SMC is working on a solution.

WORKAROUND
==========

The SMC 9232 NIC is not on the current Hardware Compatibility List for Windows
NT 3.51. Until this problem is resolved by SMC, replace the SMC 9232 with a
network adapter that is listed on the HCL.
