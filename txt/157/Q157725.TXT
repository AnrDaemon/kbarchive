TITLE   :PRB: Min and Max Buttons Disappear when ControlBox = .F.
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual FoxPro 5.0, the Minimize, Maximize, and Exit buttons disappear from
the title bar of a form when the ControlBox property of a form is set to
False(.F.). This behavior is different in Visual FoxPro versions 3.0 and 3.0b,
where the Control-Menu box in the upper left corner of the form disappears and
the Exit button only becomes disabled, when the ControlBox property is set to
False(.F.).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior in Visual FoxPro 5.0 occurs because FoxPro no longer draws all of
its non-client areas. The operating system, which is Windows 95 or Windows NT
4.0, takes care of this operation. When the ControlBox property of a form is set
to False(.F.), Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0 detects that there is no control
box. It then presumes that you do not want to perform any of the operations that
were contained within th1s control, such as Minimize, Maximize, or Exit.
Therefore, the controls are removed.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ControlBox property is used to specify whether a Control-menu box appears in
the upper-left corner of a form or toolbar at run time. When the ControlBox
property is set to False(.F.), the control-menu box disappears from the upper
left corner of a form; however, when the ControlBox property is set to
True(.T.), the control-menu box re-appears again.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form in the Form Designer.

2. Set the ControlBox property of the form in the Properties windows to
   False(.F.).

Immediately after setting the ControlBox property to False(.F.), the Maximize,
Minimize, and Close buttons disappear from the form title bar.
