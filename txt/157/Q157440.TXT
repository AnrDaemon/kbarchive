======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows 95 SNA Server Client configured for TCP/IP protocol gets the Microsoft
Network (MSN) sign-on dialog box every time the client software is started. This
should happen only on computers that were configured for using MSN at a previous
time.

NOTE: Any third party 5250 and 3270 clients that use the SNA Server client to
connect to a host system and reflect this behavior can use the following
workaround.

CAUSE
=====

When MSN is installed, it automatically configures the computer to autodial MSN
whenever a TCP/IP winsock call is attempted.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNINGS:

 - The following workaround will affect the behavior of applications which need
   to use MSN as their service provider.

 - Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide problems
   that may require you to reinstall Windows 95 to correct them. Microsoft
   cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor
   can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

To change this behavior on standard installs of Microsoft Windows 95 with MSN:

 - Run the Control Panel Internet application and then clear the Use AutoDial
   check box.

   -or-

 - Right click the Internet icon on the desktop. Select Properties and clear the
   Use AutoDial check box.

The following will be necessary if you use Microsoft Internet Explorer version
3.0, or any other browser that changes the Internet Control Panel Applet:

 - Run the Windows 95 Registry Editor and change the EnableAutodial Binary value
   of the following keys to 00 00 00 00:

   MyComputer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ 
   Internet Settings

   MyComputer\HKEY_USERS\.Default\Software\Microsoft\Windows\ 
   CurrentVersion\Internet Settings
