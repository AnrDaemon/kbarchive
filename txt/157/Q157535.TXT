SYMPTOMS
========

Sending a document created by the Memo Wizard to a Microsoft Outlook recipient,
the message title contains an invalid character at the end.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Outlook picks up the subject of the mail message from the memo title
and doesn't know how to suppress the carriage return/line feed (paragraph
mark).

This does not occur when the mail recipient is using Microsoft Exchange as the
mail client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
beginning of this article.
