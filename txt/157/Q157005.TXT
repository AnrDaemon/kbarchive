TITLE   :XCLN: Invalid Page Fault in Mapi32.dll
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0; :4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange for Windows 95, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Simple MAPI function MAPISendMail(), its data structure
contains a Cc: recipient, the MAPI_DIALOG flag is set, and the simple SendNote
UI is turned ON, the client or application calling this function might generate
an invalid page fault or general protection fault in module Mapi32.dll.

CAUSE
=====

A parameter that is passed into the function that displays the Send Note UI is
incorrectly set to NULL and this causes the fault in Mapi32.dll


WORKAROUND
==========

Do not set the MAPISendMail() MAPI_DIALOG flag, do not turn on the simple
SendNote UI flag, or do not include a Cc: recipient.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange clients,
version 4.0, listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected
in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S. Service Pack 4. For information on
