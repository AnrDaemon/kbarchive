TITLE   :Batch.exe Creates [InstallLocationsMRU] Section Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Batch Installation Utility (Batch.exe) included with
Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1 to create a custom Msbatch.inf file that
contains an [InstallLocationsMRU] section, the section is successfully added to
the file. However, after you install Windows 95 using the custom Msbatch.inf
file, the [InstallLocationsMRU] section may not be implemented as you intended
it to be.

CAUSE
=====

When you use the Batch.exe tool to create an Msbatch.inf file that contains an
[InstallLocationsMRU] section, the section is added to the file and entries for
each path that you specify are added to the section. However, the entries are
created using an incorrect syntax.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, manually edit the Msbatch.inf file so that each
entry in the [InstallLocationsMRU] section uses the following syntax

   <source>=mru<n>

where <source> is the path that you want to appear in the list of folders
from which you can choose when you are prompted for the location of the Windows
95 Setup files and <n> is a sequential number associated with each entry.

For example, the [InstallLocationsMRU] section could appear similar to the
following example:

   [InstallLocationsMRU]
   \\server\share\folder=mru1
   c:\win95=mru2
   \\winserver\source=mru3

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: sp1 mru1 mru2 mru3
