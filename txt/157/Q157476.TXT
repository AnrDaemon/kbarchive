KEYWORDS:kbualink97

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you convert a Word 97 document that contains equation objects to
WordPerfect 5.x for Windows format, and then reopen the document in Word 97, the
equation objects appear to be missing. If field codes view is turned on, you
will see the {Embed.Equation.3} fields; however, if field codes view is turned
off, you do not see the equation objects.

The document appears correctly when opened in WordPerfect 5.x or 6.x. However,
when you edit and save the document in WordPerfect and then reopen the document
in Word 97, the objects appear to be missing.

WORKAROUND
==========

The objects are still present in the document, but it may be difficult to locate
them. Turn on field codes view to determine where they are located, turn off
field codes view, and then double-click the equation object to update it.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
