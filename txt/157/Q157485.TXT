TITLE   :Taskbar Leaves Trail on Programs with Auto Hide Enabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdisplay kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you size the taskbar to be higher than one button and enable the Auto Hide
option, when the taskbar hides itself it leaves a trail of its borders in the
window of any program it happened to overlap. When the taskbar is completely
hidden, the program's window is redrawn and the trail disappears. This behavior
also occurs if the taskbar is attached to the side of the screen rather than the
bottom, but does not depend on the size of the taskbar.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, disable the Show Window Contents While Dragging
option on the Plus! tab in Display properties.
