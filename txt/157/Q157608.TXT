TITLE   :User Migration Fails If Only the "Everyone" Group Exists
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Migration Tool for NetWare (Nwconv.exe) to transfer user and
group accounts from a NetWare server to a computer running Windows NT Server, no
user accounts are transferred. In addition, you see the following error message
in the log file:

   Error: getting groups on server: <server-name>

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if there are no groups other than the default EVERYONE
group on the NetWare server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, create another group (other than the EVERYONE
group) on the NetWare server before you migrate the accounts to Windows NT.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51 and 4.0.

Additional query words: nwconv migrate convert
