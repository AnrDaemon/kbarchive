TITLE   :XCLN: Saving an Encrypted Message to the IS Can Delete Content
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you save an encrypted message to the Microsoft Exchange Information Store
(IS) twice, while the message is still open in the Microsoft Exchange client,
the text in the body of the message might be deleted.

CAUSE
=====

When you save an open, encrypted message to the IS, the body of the message is
encrypted and then deleted. This change will not be reflected in the open
message. If you perform another save while the message is still open, the now
empty body of the message will be encrypted and re-written to the IS, causing
the original message content to be deleted.

WORKAROUND
==========

After you save an encrypted message, close the message window before saving it
again.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange clients,
version 4.0, listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected
in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S. Service Pack 4. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
