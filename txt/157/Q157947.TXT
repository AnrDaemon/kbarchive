SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to create a report based on a query by placing the SELECT
statement in the Init method of the DataEnvironment.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the following steps to create a report based on a query:

1. Issue the following command in the command window:

         CREATE TABLE TEST (fld_one C(5), fld_two N(5))

2. Add five records, three of them with "aaa" in fld_one.

3. Create a report, and add the table to the DataEnvironment.

4. Drag the fields to the detail band.

5. Remove the Alias reference from each field in the report.

6. In the Init method of the DataEnvironment enter the following code:

         USE test  && Only need if the table is not already open.
         SELECT fld_one, fld_two ;
           FROM Test where fld_one= "aaa" ;
           INTO CURSOR Temp

7. In the Destroy method of the DataEnvironment enter CLOSE ALL. (You may leave
   this out if you do not want to close everything.)

8. Remove the table from the DataEnvironment.

9. Save the report as QueryTest.

10. In the Command window issue either of the following two commands:

          REPORT FORM Querytest to PRINT

   -or-

          REPORT FORM Querytest PREVIEW
