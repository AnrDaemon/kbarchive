The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Expedia, Internet edition, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Some Microsoft Expedia features, such as printing, mouse control, and keyboard
functions, may behave differently than they would in other programs. This occurs
because these features are controlled by your web browser

MORE INFORMATION
================

Many features in Microsoft Expedia do not function as you would expect in some
Windows programs. These features include printing, the program's response to
mouse input, and the use of keyboard shortcuts.

The web browser you are using, which provides the application "environment" for
Microsoft Expedia, controls these features.

Some features controlled by your Web browser include:

 - Printing. For example, printouts may not look exactly like the Web page. This
   varies tremendously, depending on your choice of browser.

 - Reaction to mouse. For example, check boxes are checked even if the mouse is
   moved away from them before the button is released.

   NOTE: In Microsoft Windows, this is not standard behavior, but may be normal
   for some browsers.

 - Keyboard shortcuts. For example, if you press the F1 keyboard key in Windows,
   Help usually starts. Your browser may interpret F1 differently.

The Web browser also controls many other features. To help avoid problems, you
should use the most current version of your preferred browser.
