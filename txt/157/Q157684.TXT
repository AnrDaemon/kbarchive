TITLE   :XFOR: IMC Might Lose Inbound and Outbound Messages
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector (IMC) might lose mail under
specific conditions. No events or error messages will be reported if the
conditions that cause the IMC to lose mail arise. The only symptom of this
problem is the failure to receive a mail message without the originator ever
receiving a Non-Delivery Report (NDR).

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two possible conditions that can cause the IMC to lose mail. When the
IMC is receiving inbound messages and has successfully begun creating a message,
the IMC will make a call to OpenStreamOnFile() for the incoming message. If the
call to OpenStreamOnFile() fails, the IMC will fail to create the message and
will delete the inbound message without logging any errors.

The IMC can also lose messages when processing outbound messages. When attempting
to send a message outbound, the IMC will attempt to open the message residing in
the store. If the IMC is unable to open the message, the IMC will delete the
message from the store. No notification of this problem will occur.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
