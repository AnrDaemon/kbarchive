PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows 95, version 7.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the Windows 95 screen saver starts on top of a Schedule+ appointment
reminder, you cannot use the keyboard to dismiss the screen saver. However, you
can still use the mouse to dismiss the screen saver.

This issue has also been reported when using Microsoft Outlook 98.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Schedule+ version 7.0
Windows 95 client. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

All keystrokes used in an attempt to dismiss the screen saver are actually
processed by the reminder dialog box. Therefore, if you press either the ENTER
or ESC key, the reminder is removed, and you may miss the appointment
altogether.
