TITLE   :FIX: Resize Event Automatically Called in SubClassed PageFrame
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbvfp kbvfp500aFIX kbvfp500bugkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Resize event of a subclassed PageFrame is called automatically when the
object is being instantiated.

WORKAROUND
==========

One way to prevent the Resize method code from being executed where the object
is being instantiated is by setting a public variable, or user- defined
property, in the PageFrame Init event and checking the variable in the Resize
event.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro
5.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Resize event of a PageFrame is called only if the Resize event is explicitly
called from within the code. If not, the Resize event is not called
automatically. The above symptom occurs in only a subclassed PageFrame.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a PageFrame control in the Class Designer.

2. In the Resize event of the PageFrame control, put in the following line of
   code:

         WAIT WINDOW "Resize - PageFrame Class"

3. In the Init event of the PageFrame control, put in the following line of
   code:

         WAIT WINDOW "Init - PageFrame Class"

4. Save the Class.

5. Create a form.

6. Add the PageFrame class that you just created in Class Designer onto the
   form.

7. Save and run the form. The PageFrame Resize method fires as evidenced by the
   Wait Window "Resize - PageFrame Class" appearing.
