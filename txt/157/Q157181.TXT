======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks (Hangul Version), version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

For unread messages listed in the Inbox of the Hangul version of Microsoft Mail
(HMail) client 3.5, only the top 80 percent of the sender's display name in the
"From" column is displayed. The bottom of the sender's display name is cut off.

CAUSE
=====

The font that is used to display the sender's display name is too big.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, change the font size of the Korean version of
Windows NT in the Control Panel Display tool to "medium." This modification
affects all of the Korean Windows NT system font.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in running Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks (Hangul version), version 3.5 on the Korean version of Windows NT 3.51.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
