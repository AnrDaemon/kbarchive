TITLE   :PRB: Get Info Settings Not Reflected on Other WorkStations
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.5b,2.5c,2.6a,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c, 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Changes made to the memory allocated to an application residing on a shared
drive are not recognized by other computers connecting to that drive. This is
true if the application program is also locked when the memory allocation is
changed in the Get Info dialog box. Microsoft Visual FoxPro, Microsoft FoxPro
2.6, and the Visual FoxPro Support Libraries and executable files created in
FoxPro 2.6 are application programs.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the memory allocated to the application program and close the Get Info
dialog box without selecting the Locked option. Then Get Info on the application
program again and lock it. To invoke the Get Info dialog box, highlight the
appropriate icon, and click Get Info on the File menu.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior occurs only when changing both the memory requirements and the
locked status of the application and then closing the Get Info dialog box to
save both changes simultaneously. If the Locked check box is selected, the
memory settings cannot be changed. Clear the Locked check box to change the
memory settings.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. On a workstation machine, highlight the application located on the server,
   click open on the File menu. The Get Info dialog box appears.

2. Change the Preferred size under the Memory Requirements section.

3. Click on the Locked check box to lock the file and close the Get Info dialog
   box.

4. On a different machine, connect to the share containing the FoxPro
   application file, highlight the file, and open the Get Info dialog box.
   Notice that the memory settings reflect the normal default values.
