Overview
--------

To access T-Online using Windows NT RAS, create a RAS Phonebook entry that
uses the script provided below:

1. Read the Limitations of the T-Online Script Method section.

2. Be sure you have met the requirements listed in the Prerequisites
   section.

3. Follow the instructions in the Creating a RAS Phonebook Entry section.

4. Follow the instructions in the T-Online Script section and modify the
   script if necessary.

5. Save the script with the name T-Online.scp in the directory
   %SystemRoot%\System32\Ras.

6. To set up your e-mail and newsreader program, read the News Server and
   Mail Server Information section.

Limitations of the T-Online Script Method
-----------------------------------------

The limitation of this access method are:

 - this script does not work with ISDN.

 - the connection is slow because T-Online only allows 14,4000 bps without
   compression.

 - If you unsuccessfully submit your credentials during the log on process
   more than three times, the German Telekom disables your account. German
   Telekom does not reenable your account free of charge.

Prerequisites
-------------

The prerequisites to make this script work with a RAS phonebook entry are:

 - RAS and a modem are already installed. If not, please read the Network
   Guide, chapter 6, "Installing and Configuring Remote Access Service".

 - Your modem should be configured with the parameter settings for T-Online
   access with the standard T-Online decoder. These parameters are
   described in the T-Online documentation.

 - RAS should be configured to "Dial out only" or "Dial out and Receive
   calls".

 - The TCP/IP protocol should be enabled for RAS.

Creating a RAS Phonebook Entry
------------------------------

To set up this connection, perform the following steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and
   click Dial-Up Networking.

2. Click New.

3. Type the connection name, for example, T-Online Internet, and enable "I
   know all about phonebook entries and would rather edit the properties
   directly". Click Finish.

4. Open a Window "New Phonebook Entry" with the register "Basic".
   Please type the correct "Phone number" (should be 01910), and select
   your modem.

5. Click Server register.

6. Select SLIP: Internet as the Dial-up server type.

7. Enable TCP/IP as the Network protocol.

8. Click TCP/IP Settings.

9. Type 194.25.2.129 for the Primary DNS address, and type the same address
   for the Secondary DNS address or the address of another known DNS
   Server.

10. All other IP addresses should stay 0.

11. Disable Force IP header compression and enable "Use default gateway
    on remote network".

12. The Frame size should stay 1006.

13. Click OK for SLIP TCP/IP settings.

14. Click register Script.

15. Select Run this script, and then click Refresh list.

16. Choose the script %Systemroot%\System32\Ras\T-Online.scp

17. Go to register Security.

18. Select "Accept any authentication including clear text"

19. Click OK for Edit Phonebook Entry.

Now you are ready to dial in to T-Online.

T-Online Script
---------------

If you are not the first user of your account, change the number of the
user of this account (Mitbenutzernummer) from 0001 to your number. This
script allows you to input your access number (Anschlusskennung) as a user
ID and your password in the dialog box.

If the service provider computer does not respond, you can increase the
values after "delay" in the script to allow the remote computer more time
to respond.
