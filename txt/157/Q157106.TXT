SYMPTOMS
========

When you set up a mail merge in Word, you may receive the following error
message:

   Word could not open <file name.doc> as a data or header source because
   it is the active mail merge main document.

CAUSE
=====

The file that you are attempting to attach as a data (header) source has been
previously set as a main document in Word.

WORKAROUND
==========

To reset the condition of the data source, follow these steps:

1. Close all documents currently open in Word.

2. Open the data file you want to use in the merge.

3. On the Tools menu, click Mail Merge.

4. In the Mail Merge Helper, click the Create button.

5. From the Create list, click "Restore to Normal Word Document."

   The following message appears:

   By restoring <file name.doc> to a normal Word document, the text of the
   document will not change. However, <file name.doc> will no longer be a
   mail merge main document. Do you want to continue?

   Click Yes.

6. From the Mail Merge Helper, click the Close button.

7. Save and close from the data source.

8. Perform the mail merge process again.
