TITLE   :LAN Man 2.2c Diskless Client May Not Respond As Some Apps Run
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Microsoft LAN Manager 2.2c diskless client starts MS-DOS and Windows 3.1
from a Windows NT version 3.51 remote boot server, and the TEMP and TMP
environment variables point to drive C (which is really on the Windows NT 3.51
remote boot server), running some applications may cause the diskless
workstation to stop responding. Pointing the TEMP and TMP environment variables
to a network share on the Windows NT 3.51 boot server also causes the failure.
These symptoms are displayed when you run applications such as Microsoft
Publisher and Autodesk AutoCAD on the diskless client.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, point the TEMP and TMP environment variables to a local
floppy disk drive, a RAM drive, or a share on a computer running Windows 95.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A
supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
