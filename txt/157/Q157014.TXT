TITLE   :XFOR: IMC Deletes Mail in MTS-OUT if no Code Page on MIME Tab
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a code page is chosen that is not configured on the MIME Types tab of the
Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector's (IMC) property page, outbound mail
will be deleted from MTS-OUT without a notification to the IMC Administrator or
the originator. The originator will believe that the message has been delivered,
but it will never arrive.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT has been configured to use a specific code page, but the IMC has not.
The errors generated cause the IMC to delete the outbound message from
\exchsrvr\imcdata\out.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
