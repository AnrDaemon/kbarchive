The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a Web page using the Web Page Wizard, extra copies of the
graphics are saved in the same folder where you save your Web page.

CAUSE
=====

The images, bullets, and horizontal rules in the original page are embedded;
Word copies these to the folder where you save your web page establishing a
relative link to the graphic images.

If your Web page will be moved to a server, you can copy the entire folder and
its contents to the new location. This helps ensure that your images display and
hyperlinks work when others view your Web page.

WORKAROUND
==========

There is no workaround currently available.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
