The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to create a new macro, you receive the following error
message:

   Invalid Procedure Name

CAUSE
=====

The macro name contains invalid characters or reserved identifiers, or the
length exceeds 80 characters.


WORKAROUND
==========

Rename the macro to contain fewer than 80 charecters. For tips on valid macro
names see the More Information section of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Valid macro names:

 - Must begin with a letter.

 - Cannot contain spaces or non-alphanumeric characters (such as &, *, /,
   and so on).

 - Cannot contain periods. You may use a period (.) in a macro name only to
   explicitly define a procedure within a module. For example, if you type in
   the new macro name "my.test", you have created a new Module called "my"
   containing a Procedure named "test".

 - Cannot exceed 80 characters.

 - Cannot conflict with a program's reserved identifiers or keywords, such as
   the word "print".
