OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are running Microsoft Schedule+ version 1.x and Microsoft Mail and you
attempt to invite a resource when creating an appointment, you may not be
notified if a conflicting appointment exists in the resource's appointment book.
This problem occurs when the resource account is managed by Microsoft Exchange
Server and the resource account has been configured to automatically accept
meeting requests.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server version 4.0.
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Exchange
Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you install the Service Pack, you are notified when the resource account
must decline the invitation because a conflicting appointment exists. However,
you are not notified if the appointment cannot be accepted because of network
problems or because the Microsoft Exchange Server computer is not available.
