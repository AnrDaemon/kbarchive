SUMMARY
=======

When a sound is recorded in a movie in Microsoft 3D Movie Maker, the sound is
only available within that movie. The sound is embedded within the movie file
and is only available for use within the movie from which it was recorded.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sounds with the same name may be created within the same movie. Each sound
appears by the same name (for example, SoundFile), but it will play different
sounds when activated.

For information about removing sounds, see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
