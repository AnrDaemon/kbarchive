SSARC.EXE and SSRESTOR.EXE are utilities included with Visual SourceSafe 5.0
that allow users to archive specific versions of projects or files and restore
those archives back to the original or to a different database.

According to the documentation, SSARC.EXE can only be run by the SourceSafe
administrator. However, if the administrator has no password, any user can run
the program.

   password (if there is one).

   "SS WHOAMI" (without the quotation marks)

   Your login name is echoed to the console.

3. From the server installation of SourceSafe, switch to the WIN32 subdirectory
   and run SSARC.EXE <archive file to create> <project>. Note that
