The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Letter Wizard to create a letter with the Contemporary Letter
template, the following problems may occur:

 - The letter date is displayed and printed with a vertical dotted line.

   -or-

 - No company name appears at the top of the letter.

   -or-

 - No text appears in the gray horizontal bar at the bottom of the letter.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the appropriate method for your situation.

NOTE: Before using any of these methods, first click Page Layout on the View
menu. This is important because objects in the drawing layer of the document
(the gray horizontal bar and the vertical dotted line) are not visible in normal
view.

Letter Date Is Displayed and Printed with a Vertical Dotted Line
----------------------------------------------------------------

To work around this problem, use any of the following methods.

Method 1: Move the Letter Date Down Using Extra Blank Lines

1. Move the insertion point to the left of the letter date.

2. Press ENTER several times to move the date below the gray horizontal bar at
   the top of the letter. This step moves the entire letter down, and places
   several blank lines at the top of the letter.

Method 2: Move the Letter Date Down Using Paragraph Spacing

1. Move the insertion point to the left of the letter date.

2. On the Format menu, click Paragraph.

3. Under Spacing, change the Before box to 1" (or 72 pt), and click OK.

Method 3: Use Pre-Printed Letterhead Option in Letter Wizard

1. Create a new letter by clicking Letter Wizard on the Tools menu.

2. On the Letter Format tab, click to select the Pre-printed Letterhead check
   box.

3. In the "How much space does the letterhead need?" box, increase the default
   value (for example, increase the value from 1" to 2.3"). This step moves the
   entire letter below the gray horizontal bar at the top of the letter.

No Company Name Appears at the Top of the Letter
------------------------------------------------

First, use one of the methods in the "Letter Date Is Displayed and Printed with a
Vertical Dotted Line" section to move the date down from the top of the letter.
Then follow these steps to add a company name:

1. On the View menu, click Header and Footer.

2. Right-click the gray horizontal bar, and then click Add Text on the shortcut
   menu.

3. Type your company name or other text as appropriate.

4. Select the text you just typed. On the Format menu, click Font. In the Color
   list, click White or the color of your choice. Make any other formatting
   changes as appropriate (for example, change Size to 14), and then click OK.

5. On the Header and Footer toolbar, click Close.

No Text Appears in the Gray Horizontal Bar at the Bottom of the Letter
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can add text that you want to stand out to the gray horizontal bar at the
bottom of your letter. For example, to add the word "Confidential" to this bar,
follow these steps:

1. On the View menu, click Header and Footer.

2. On the Header and Footer toolbar, click the "Switch Between Header and
   Footer" button to switch to the footer.

3. Right-click the gray horizontal bar, and then click Add Text on the shortcut
   menu.

4. Type "Confidential" (without the quotation marks), or other text as
   appropriate.

5. Select the text you just typed. On the Format menu, click Font. In the Color
   list, click White or the color of your choice. Make any other formatting
   changes as appropriate (for example, change Size to 14), and then click OK.

6. On the Header and Footer toolbar, click Close.
