TITLE   :XADM: Err Msg: You Must Specify a Server in the Organization
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Exchange administrator is trying to install a new site connector by
selecting New on the File menu, and Site Connector under Other. The servers are
in the same organization but in two different sites. When the administrator
performs this operation, the following error message appears:

   You must specify a server that is in the organization but not in the site.

CAUSE
=====

The organization name is not exactly the same on the two Exchange Server
computers. The organization name may be misspelled on one server or have
additional punctuation (underscore, comma, and so forth) that makes it different
from the other server's organization name.

RESOLUTION
==========

One of the Exchange Servers must be reinstalled or the Exchange Administrator
program is connected to the same server on which you are attempting to create a
connector. Connect via the Administrator program to the correct server where the
connector is to be created.
