TITLE   :BUG: Remote View Has Only Two Join Types
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5,5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp500 kbvfp600 kbMDAC250

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Remote View designer has only two types of Join conditions, Left Outer and
None.

CAUSE
=====

Visual FoxPro delegates the SQL query to the ODBC driver in order to be
compatible across multiple back ends. Visual FoxPro uses the ODBC outer join
extension, which supports only left outer join.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following code sample creates a remote view using a inner join:

         *Start Code Example
         close all
         create data Test1
         MyConnstr="driver=sql server; ";
          + server=MyServernt;uid=sa;pwd=;database=pubs"
         create connection mycon connstr (MyConnstr)
         create sql view Test1 remote connection mycon Share as select * from;
           titles inner join titleauthor on ;
           titles.title_id=titleauthor.title_id
         *End Code Example

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Using the 32-Bit ODBC Driver Manager, create a DataSource for a database on a
   Remote Server like the "pubs" database on Microsoft SQL Server.

2. Open a database and create a remote view using the DataSource specified
   above.

3. Add a table to the Remote View.

4. Add another related table to the view. When the Join Condition dialog box
   appears, click Cancel.

5. Click the Join tab of the Remote View designer and then click the Type
   drop-down list box.

Note that Only two Join Conditions are available: "Left Outer Join" and
"<None>."
