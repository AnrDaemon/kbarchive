SYMPTOMS
========

Font changes made to the Delivery Address or the Return Address on the Envelopes
tab may not be saved between instances of the Envelopes And Labels dialog box.

envelope Delivery Address or Return Address. If you want the changes to be
permanent, you need to change the Envelope Address style or Envelope Return
style.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the following steps to permanently change either the Envelope Address style
or the Envelope Return style:

1. On the Format menu, click Style.

2. In the Style dialog box, under List, select All styles. Under Styles, select
   the either the Envelope Address or Envelope Return style, and then click
   Modify.

3. In the Modify Style dialog box, click to select the Add to template check
   box, click the Format button, and then click Font.

4. In the Font dialog box, select the font and properties desired.

5. Click OK twice to return to the Style dialog box.

6. Click Close.
