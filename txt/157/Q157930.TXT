TITLE   :Multiple DNS Server Addresses Not Assigned Properly with DHCP
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use multiple Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
servers to dynamically assign Domain Name Service (DNS) server addresses to
multiple network adapters installed in your computer, the DNS server addresses
may not be assigned properly.

CAUSE
=====

You cannot manually assign different DNS server addresses to multiple network
adapters in Windows 95. To assign different DNS server addresses to multiple
network adapters, you must use DHCP servers. If each network adapter is
connected to a network that contains a DHCP server, the DHCP servers can be used
to dynamically assign DNS server addresses to each network adapter. However, the
Wsock32.dll file included with Windows 95 does not properly implement this
feature.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.
