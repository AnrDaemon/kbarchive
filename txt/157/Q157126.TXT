SYMPTOMS
========

When you specify a connection string that begins with the characters ODBC;,
CDatabase::OpenEx() does not behave as expected.

OpenEx() may fail to open an ODBC datasource using a connection string that
worked with Open(). Some drivers may appear to ignore information in the
connection string, such as the userid and password. You may also get an error
message in the output window similar to the following:

   Invalid connection string attribute

CAUSE
=====

CDatabase::OpenEx() does not accept a connection string beginning with ODBC;.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the ODBC; prefix from the connection string for OpenEx().

MORE INFORMATION
================

CDatabase::Open() removes the ODBC; prefix from the connection string before
passing it to OpenEx().

If an invalid connection string is passed to the driver, it will look in the
registry for connection information.
