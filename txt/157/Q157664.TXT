TITLE   :WD97: Picture Deleted When Typing Text into Text Box
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kblayout

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a text box contains only a picture, the picture and text box may be deleted
when you try to type text into the text box.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you want to type text in a text box that contains only a picture, right-click
the border of the text box and click Edit Text on the shortcut menu. This places
your insertion point to the left of the picture. Any text typed into the text
box forces the picture down. You may have to resize the text box depending on
the amount of text typed into the text box.

If you want to type text after the picture is in the text box, press ESC+END.
This places the insertion point below the picture. You may have to resize the
text box depending on the amount of text you type into the text box.

If you don't need the picture in the text box, select the picture (after text has
been typed in the text box) and delete the picture. The text box is not deleted
if you add text to the text box before deleting the picture.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

This feature is different from Word for Windows 95, Word 6.0 for Windows, Word
6.0 for Windows NT, and Word 6.0 for the Macintosh. In the previous versions of
Word, you can select just the picture and type text into a text box containing
only a picture,. The text replaces the picture without deleting the text box.

In Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, with a text box containing only a picture, if
you select the picture and type text, the picture and the text box are deleted.
The typed text is added to the body of the document.
