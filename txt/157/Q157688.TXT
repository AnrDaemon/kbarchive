TITLE   :XCLN: Reminders not Processed When Default Store is PST
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0; :4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange for Windows 95, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Exchange user reminders stop processing after a period of time when
the default information store is a personal store (PST).

CAUSE
=====

When the default information store is a PST, a search folder is used to locate
items in a user's calendar that have reminders. If there is a folder added
during the time that this background search was happening, all events after the
folder addition will fail to process.


WORKAROUND
==========

If you restart the Microsoft Exchange client, events after the folder addition
will be processed. However, this will not prevent the problem from occurring
again.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange clients,
version 4.0, listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected
in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S. Service Pack 4. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
