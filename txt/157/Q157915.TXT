TITLE   :SMS: Network Monitor Save As Only Saves One Frame
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsmsAdmin smsadmin smsnetmon

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Network Monitor to perform a network sniff of a particular Systems
Management Server (SMS) client and you click Save As on the File menu, the range
offered is only from 1 to 1. Therefore, the resulting save will only include the
first frame of the capture.

If you try to increase the To range, a dialog box will appear with the following
message:

   The To field is not in the valid range.

WORKAROUND
==========

This problem does not occur if Network Monitor was started directly from Program
Manager or Explorer. It also does not occur if a second instance of Network
Monitor was started directly from Program Manager or Explorer.

1. From Program Manager or Explorer, start Network Monitor.

2. Start the Systems Management Server Administrator.

3. Go into a client's Personal Computer Properties.

4. Select the Network Monitor icon.

5. Click Start Network Monitor.

6. When Network Monitor loads, click Start Capture Toolbar.

7. Stop the capture.

8. On the File menu, click Save As. The range will be displayed properly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
