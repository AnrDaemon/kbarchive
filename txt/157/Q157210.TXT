TITLE   :XCLN: Invalid Procedure Call from Mefbrows.exe
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbinterop kbprogramming kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to run the Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer for Microsoft
Mail for PC Networks e-form Mefbrows.exe from a Microsoft Exchange Windows NT
client, the following error may occur.

   Invalid procedure call

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur because Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client uses the
Msmail32.ini and Shared32.ini initialization files exclusively. Mefbrows.exe is
designed to search only the Msmail.ini and Shared.ini files for Microsoft Mail
Forms Designer e-forms.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can work around this problem by modifying and regenerating an executable
file for Mefbrows.exe.

The Visual Basic Project for Mefbrows.exe contains a Constants.bas file that
includes the following declarations.

      Global Const SHARED_INI$ = "SHARED.INI"
      Global Const LOCAL_INI$ = "MSMAIL.INI

1. Replace the "SHARED.INI" declaration with "SHARED32.INI".

2. Replace "MSMAIL.INI" with "MSMAIL32.INI".

3. Create a new executable file for the project using either Microsoft Visual
   Basic 3.0 or Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 16-bit. The source code for
   Mefbrows.exe can be found on the Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer
   installation disks.
