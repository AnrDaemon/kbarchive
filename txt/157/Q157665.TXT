MORE INFORMATION
================

In Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, if you print a document containing an EPS
picture to a PostScript file and then send the file to a PostScript printer, the
picture is cut off at the top by 1 point.

This problem is not easily seen if the picture has white space at the top of the
picture. It is seen if the image extends to the top of the picture.

This problem does not occur if the document is printed directly from Word 97 for
Windows.
