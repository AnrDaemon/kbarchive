Microsoft does not encourage or support changes to .inf files; therefore,
Microsoft Technical Support does not support the procedure in this article.
Although we have tested the following procedure and it appears to function as
described, make a backup copy of your .inf file before you proceed.

In the Msbatch.inf file, modify the [Install] section to include the following
line:

   delreg=no.inbox.wizard

Modify the [Optional Components] section to match the following line:

   "Microsoft Exchange"=1
