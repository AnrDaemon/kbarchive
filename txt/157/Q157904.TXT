SUMMARY
=======

You may wish to run Scholastic's Magic School Bus Explores the Earth (MSB Earth)
without placing the CD ROM in the drive each time you use the program. To do so
requires that you copy almost all of the contents of the CD ROM (Total on CD
ROM: 219 MB) to a hard drive (or similar drive) that is either connected to your
computer directly or connected by a network.

Though possible to accomplish the task mentioned above, you must ensure that you
have all of the appropriate licenses with Microsoft for MSB Earth and any other
products you configure in this manner.

It is not recommended nor supported by Microsoft to run MSB Earth from any other
source than from a CD ROM drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To run MSB Earth from a source other than a CD ROM, follow the steps detailed
below.

Local Hard Drive
----------------

1. Create a folder on your hard drive to store the contents of the CD ROM (such
   as, "EarthDir").

2. Copy the contents of the CD ROM to the EarthDir directory on your hard drive.

3. Run the Setup.exe program from the EarthDir directory.

Network Share
-------------

1. Create a folder on the server computer's hard to store the contents of the CD
   ROM (such as, "EarthDir").

2. Share the EarthDir directory and its contents so that the client computer
   (from which you wish to run MSB Earth) can access the EarthDir and its
   subfolders.

3. On the Client Computer, connect to the EarthDir share on the server computer.
   Note: You may need to map a drive letter to the share for MSBEarth to run
   properly.

4. Run the Setup.exe program from the EarthDir share location.

After completing the steps listed above, you should be able to run MSB Earth
without inserting the CD ROM into the drive of your computer.

Eliminating the need for the CD ROM disc while running a program will increase
the performance on nearly every machine. Because reading from a hard drive is
generally greater than 10 times faster than reading from a CD ROM, and by
following the steps above to eliminate CD ROM from the performance equation, you
may notice that the program runs faster.
