======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Letter Wizard default information is reset to blank if the Normal template
(Normal.dot) is renamed or deleted.


MORE INFORMATION
================

In Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, all default information for the Letter Wizard
is now stored as AutoText entries in the Normal.dot template. This is different
from the other wizards in Word 97 where the default information is stored in the
Windows Registry. In previous versions of Word (6.0/7.0), this information was
stored in the Wordwiz.ini file in the Windows directory.

The following lists the items from the Letter Wizard that are stored as AutoText
entries in the Normal.dot file:

Item                     Letter Wizard Dialog Tab   AutoText Name
----------------------   ------------------------   -------------------

Sender's Name            Sender Info                Signature
Job Title                Sender Info                Signature Job Title
Company                  Sender Info                Signature Company
Writer/Typist Initials   Sender Info                Reference Initials
Recipient Name           Recipient Info             Inside Address Name

NOTE: If you rename or delete the Normal.dot template, the above information is
lost. You may want to back up or copy the Normal.dot template.
