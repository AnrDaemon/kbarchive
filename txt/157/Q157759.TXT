TITLE   :FIX: Calendar Control Help File Contains an Invalid Jump
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhelpfile kbActiveX kbvfp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Calendar control is one of the ActiveX controls that comes with Visual
FoxPro 5.0. The Help file for the Calendar control is Msacal70.hlp. Most ActiveX
controls use the Visual Basic Help file Ctrlref.hlp. The Calendar control is a
Microsoft Access control, and only Microsoft Access can use the ControlSource
property. Attempting to use the ControlSource jump in the Help file results in
the following error because it is looking for a specific Microsoft Access Help
file:

   Cannot find the Acvba80.hlp file. Do you want to try to find this file
   yourself?

CAUSE
=====

The Acvba80.hlp file did not ship with Visual FoxPro 5.0.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.
