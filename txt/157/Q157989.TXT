In the Debugger Watch window, deleting the text in the Name column causes an
Application error following which Visual FoxPro is down.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run Visual FoxPro and create an object as in the following:

         MyForm = CREATEOBJECT("Form")

2. Open the Debugger in Debugger Frame mode.

3. Add MyForm as a Watch expression in the Watch window.

4. Click on the "MyForm" string under the Names column twice, or select the
   entry and then click on the MyForm string so that it goes into edit mode.
   Edit mode means that there is a blinking cursor within the MyForm entry of
   the Names column. The Mouse Cursor changes to an I-Beam when it is over the
   MyForm entry.

5. Delete the "MyForm" entry using the Backspace or Delete key

6. Press Enter.
