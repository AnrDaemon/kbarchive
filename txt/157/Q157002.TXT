 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

Attachments to a message might not be copied from an Offline Storage (OST)
message to a message held in the Microsoft Exchange Server Information Store
(IS).

CAUSE
=====

In the process of copying messages from OST to the IS, an attachment table
describing the attachments in a message needs to be updated. "MODIFY"
permissions on the parent message are not given at the point of generating the
message body and attachments from RTF during the copy process.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange clients,
version 4.0, listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected
in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S. Service Pack 4. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
