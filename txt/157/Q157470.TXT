 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The May 1996 Premium release of Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Level III
contained the Standard version of Microsoft Exchange instead of the Enterprise
version. As a result, the following connectors are not available for the May
release of the MSDN BackOffice Test Platform:

   SMTP/Internet Mail Connector
   X.400 Connector

Included in the May package is:

   MS Mail Connector

MORE INFORMATION
================

The current versions of MSDN BackOffice Test Platform (Enterprise Subscription)
include the Enterprise version of Exchange and have the two connectors missing
from the Premium release. To add the connectors:

1. Start Setup using the Exchange Server compact disc.

2. Click Add/Remove Components and then change the options for Microsoft
   Exchange Server.
