PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows

KEYWORDS:kbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Auto Accept Meeting Requests and Auto Remove Canceled Meetings features
allow meetings to be automatically created or removed from your calendar when no
conflicting appointments exist. These automatic features function even if the
account is not configured as a resource account.

NOTE: This functionality is different from earlier versions of Schedule+.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Auto Accept Meeting Requests and Auto Remove Canceled Meetings features are
client processes that function while the Schedule+ or Microsoft Exchange Inbox
are running. While the Schedule+ and Microsoft Exchange Inbox are inactive (not
running), these processes wait until you start the programs.

NOTE: When you select the "This Account is for a Resource" option in the General
Options dialog box (accessed by clicking General Options on the Options menu),
meetings are accepted or removed automatically when the Schedule+ or Microsoft
Exchange Inbox is not running for that resource account.

The originator of a meeting request can view another attendee's Schedule+ file
(assuming he or she has access privileges). The originator can see the meetings
being added to the calendar, the scheduled and non-scheduled times from the
Planner, and the status of the meeting requests (a question mark if the
appointment has not been replied to or is tentative, a red X if the appointment
was declined, or a green check mark if the meeting was accepted by each
attendee.

NOTE: When the "Work Primarily from Local file" option is selected, the
originator can not see the meeting being added to the calendar automatically.
(To locate this option, on the Tools menu, click Options, and click the
Synchronize tab.) The originator of the meeting request must close and then
reopen the attendee's schedule to see the updated calendar.

These Auto Accept Meeting Requests and Auto Remove Canceled Meetings features are
not affected by the default access permissions. For example, a user who has
Delegate Owner permissions does not have permission to automatically create or
remove meetings from the calendar unless the Schedule+ account is open. The
default access permission is set to None.
