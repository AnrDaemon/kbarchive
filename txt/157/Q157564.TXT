TITLE   :STOP: c0000263 on Upgrade from WinNT 4.0 to WinNT 3.51
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to install Windows NT 3.51 as an upgrade over Windows NT 4.0
(released build or beta), the following error message occurs:

   STOP: c0000263 {Driver Entry Point Not Found}
   The \SystemRoot\system32\drivers\Scsiscan.SYS device driver could not locate
   the entry point ObfReferenceObject in driver ntoskrnl.exe?.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT 3.51 was not designed to upgrade versions of Windows NT later than
itself. In fact, you will not have the option to upgrade Windows NT 4.0 with
Windows NT 3.51. If you attempt to install Windows NT 3.51 over an existing
Windows NT 4.0 installation, you will be prompted that the pre- existing files
will be replaced.

The Windows NT 3.51 setup process will fail just after the first reboot.

RESOLUTION
==========

After the attempted installation of Windows NT 3.51 over Windows NT 4.0, Windows
NT 4.0 will no longer be functional. The resolution will be to attempt to
either:

 - Perform a new installation of Windows NT 3.51 by deleting the existing,
   corrupted version during the Windows NT 3.51 setup process.

   -or-

 - If data/application and registry settings need to be recovered, install
   Windows NT 3.51 into another subdirectory, delete the corrupt version of
   Windows NT, and then restore a complete backup tape to the drive, including
   the registry.
