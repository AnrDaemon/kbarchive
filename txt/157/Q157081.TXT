SUMMARY
=======

If the International section [Intl] of the Win.ini file is missing or lacks some
entries, you may receive one or more of the following error messages when
compiling or loading a form:

   Invalid outside procedure

   Expected end of Statement

Further symptoms include a compile error in a hidden module named
"_#watchmodule#_." In addition, Visual Basic is not accepting standard syntax,
such as "Option Explicit". The IDE flags the syntax and turns it red.

Some error messages that appear in the design environment are "Invalid character"
and "Not valid in a procedure or module.

There are general protection faults (GPFs) in Vba2.dll at various times. To
resolve the problem:

 - Ensure that the Win.ini file (located in the Windows directory) contains the
   following text:

      [intl]
         sLanguage=enu
         sCountry=United States
         iCountry=1
         iDate=0
         iTime=0
         iTLZero=0
         iCurrency=0
         iCurrDigits=2
         iNegCurr=0
         iLzero=1
         iDigits=2
         iMeasure=1
         s1159=AM
         s2359=PM
         sCurrency=$
         sThousand=,
         sDecimal=.
         sDate=/ 
         sTime=:
         sList=,
         sShortDate=M/d/yy
         sLongDate=dddd, MMMM dd, yyyy

   The following setting can also be added to this section, although it is not
   required:

      dialog=yes
