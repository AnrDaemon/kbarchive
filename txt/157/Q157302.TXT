TITLE   :XCLN: Importing a PAB Can Result in Duplicate Entries
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you import Personal Address Book (PAB) entries more than once using a
Microsoft Exchange client, duplicate entries will be created.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Administrators who want to distribute a PAB to their users for occasional
imports will typically maintain a single PAB, making modifications to it and
sending it to their users. When those users import the PAB, duplicate entries
will be created for every entry that already exists.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
