To install the Visual FoxPro ODBC driver 5.0, run Vfpodbc5.exe. The following
information is an excerpt from the Visual FoxPro ODBC Driver 5.0 Update Release
Notes. The complete Release Notes are installed with the updated driver.

What is New in this release
---------------------------

 - Query performance is 20% faster.

 - Vfpodbc.dll is smaller (from 1.20MB to ~835KB).

 - The SET commands (see Help file for a list of supported SET commands) are now
   supported.

 - VERSION( ) is supported through stored procedures.

 - Local views are read-only.

 - If you insert or update a table with a logical field (a column with a SQL_BIT
   data type), you can now use 1 (true) and 0 (false) to store a value in a
   field. When comparing values or in an expression, you must use .T. (true) and
   .F. (false).

 - The 16-bit version of Microsoft Query (version 1.0) now works with the Visual
   FoxPro ODBC Driver.

 - SQLGetInfo( ) and SQL_FILE_USAGE now returns SQL_FILE_QUALIFIER for both
   database and free table data sources.

Known Issues
------------

 - If you insert, delete, or update a Visual FoxPro table via the Visual FoxPro
   ODBC driver, you might get a "Trigger Failed" message. Check for unsupported
   commands in the trigger.

 - INDEX ON is not supported in this release.

 - If a table is opened exclusively and the same table is accessed by another
   user with SET EXCLUSIVE OFF, then the Visual FoxPro ODBC Driver returns the
   error "Cannot Open File" instead of "File is in use by another."

 - MSQuery returns a "Cannot Access Table" error when creating a table with a
   field name that starts with a number. For example, the field name "1995
   Sales" is not allowed. Visual FoxPro does not allow the creation of field
   names that begin with a number, but MSQuery does.
