TITLE   :SMS: PCM Windows 95 Setup Error: Corrupt CAB File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95; winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbnetwork kbPCM smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After you distribute a Windows 95 upgrade package, the following dialog box
appears when setup is 15 percent through the copy list:

   Setup has detected a corrupt setup (CAB) file.
   Setup cannot continue.
   Click OK to continue.

After the message, an error reading disk 2 is reported.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you must use a custom INF, make a backup copy of the Systems Management
Server Win95.inf, and save your INF file as Win95.inf. Make sure the
installation works completely without Systems Management Server before
disturbing the Windows 95 install package.

Systems Management Server expects to find the Win95.inf file in the <Systems
Management Server root>\Logon.srv\Mstest directory. If the INF file is not in
this location, setup will not be able to find and use it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Systems Management Server 1.1 FAQ and the Systems Management Server 1.2
documentation discuss in greater detail when to use Win95.inf, Win95min.inf or
Msbatch.inf. Depending on whether you created the package source by running
NETSETUP or by simply copying the CAB files, you must use the Win95.inf file as
a parameter to the setup process. A NETSETUP install does not allow you to
provide INF files with alternative names, and will produce the error described
above if a custom INF file name is supplied. The default Windows 95
configuration file is Msbatch.inf.
