The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Copying a table from one database to another changes the index type of the table
from Primary to Candidate.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a database that has a table and a Primary key as following:

         CREATE DATABASE Test
         CREATE TABLE Tst1T1 (Fld1 c(5), Fld2 c(5))
         ALTER TABLE Tst1T1 ALTER Fld1 c(5) Primary Key

2. Open the table Tst1T1 and modify it. Select the Indexes tab in the Table
   Designer and verify that a Primary Index has been created on the first field,
   Fld1. Close the Table Designer and leave the table open in the current work
   area.

3. Create another database Test2 using "CREATE DATABASE Test2" command.

4. Issue the following commands to copy Tst1T1 table from Test1 database to
   Test2 as Tst2T1:

         SET DATABASE TO Test2
         SELECT Tst1T1
         COPY TO Tst2T1 PRODUCTION DATABASE Test2

5. When you get the "Invalid File Descriptor" error, click OK.

6. After the table Tst1T1 is copied to Test2 database as Tst2T1, open and then
   modify the Tst2T1 table in the Test2 database. When in the Table Designer,
   select the Indexes tab. Notice that the Index type has changed from Primary
   to Candidate.
