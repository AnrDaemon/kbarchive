The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you attempt to start the Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client with the
Exchange Server and Microsoft Mail services running, you may receive the
following error message

   An extension failed to initialize. The extension entry contains invalid
   parameters.

   <extension>

where <extension> is an MS Mail 3.x extension such as "0;;;;;;;;;;".

CAUSE
=====

There is an Msmail.ini file in the Winroot directory. WINROOT is the directory
which Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server was installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

 - Rename the \Winroot\Msmail.ini file to *.old.

   NOTE:In some cases the file that needs to be renamed/deleted is msmail32.ini
   rather than msmail.ini.
   -OR-

 - Remark out the invalid entry or entries referenced in the error message by
   placing a semicolon at the beginning of the line. The invalid entry or
   entries may be located in one (or more) of the following sections of the
   Msmail.ini file:

   [Custom Commands] [Custom Menus] [Custom Messages]

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Mail service for the Microsoft Exchange client checks for and uses
entries in the MSMAIL.INI file.

For additional information about how Exchange clients use the Msmail.ini, please
