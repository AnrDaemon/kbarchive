TITLE   :FIX: Breakpoint Not Refreshed for Duplicate Watch Window Entry
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbvfp kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp500bugkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The breakpoint for duplicate entries in the Debugger Watch window are not
updated unless the focus is moved from one to the other.

WORKAROUND
==========

After setting the breakpoint on one entry if you move to (Highlight) another
instance of that entry, then the duplicate is assigned a breakpoint
automatically. The reverse behavior occurs when removing the breakpoint.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run Visual FoxPro and create an object, for example:

         MyForm = CREATEOBJECT("Form")

2. Open the Debugger and enter "MyForm" (without the quotation marks) as a Watch
   expression.

3. Add "MyForm" (without the quotation marks) as a Watch expression again.

4. Select the First MyForm entry.

5. In the Watch window set a breakpoint on the first "MyForm" entry by
   double-clicking in the blank area to the left of the "+" sign for "MyForm."

6. Set a breakpoint on the second "MyForm" entry in the same manner as in the
   previous step. Make sure that you set the breakpoint without selecting the
   second entry and with the first entry of "MyForm" selected.

In step 5 you have to double-click twice to set the breakpoint. This should not
be allowed and should not be necessary. The breakpoints for duplicate entries
should be updated automatically so a change (breakpoint Insert/Remove) in one
instance affects all other instances of the entry in the Watch window.
