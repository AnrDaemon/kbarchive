The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When editing a bitmap using the Resource Editor, you may observe that icons and
bitmaps are distorted (lose form and change color) throughout the system. Also,
the bitmap itself looks distorted in the Resource Editor.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by problems in certain video drivers.

RESOLUTION
==========

Reducing the resolution and/or the number of colors using the display control
panel applet may work around this problem. There is no fix for this problem at
this time. Please check the Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows 95, Windows 98,
and Windows Millennium Edition (Me) support pages on the Microsoft Web
(http://www.microsoft.com) for video driver updates.
