KEYWORDS:kbdisplay

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

It takes a very long time for Windows NT 3.51 or Windows NT 3.51 with Service
Pack 4 to shut down (up to 30 minutes has been observed). This will happen even
with all the running services stopped manually prior to shut down. This problem
was observed on a Compaq Proliant 4500R with Pentium 166 processor and with an
on-board video adapter with Cirrus Logic chip set running the Compaq OEM version
of Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 and the Compaq OEM version of Service Pack 4 for
Microsoft Windows NT 3.51.

CAUSE
=====

The OEM version of Microsoft Service Pack 4 for Windows NT 3.51, included in the
Compaq OEM version of Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 compact disc licensed to Compaq,
does not include the latest drivers for video adapters with the Cirrus Logic
chip set.

The Cirrus.sys driver included with Service Pack 4 with the Compaq OEM version of
Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 compact disc has the following size and date:

   cirrus.sys        29152    9/15/95

The Cirrus.sys driver from Service Pack 4 for Microsoft Windows NT 3.51
downloaded from the Microsoft FTP server has the following size and date:

   cirrus.sys        30432    3/6/96 or later

RESOLUTION
==========

Rename the <winntroot>\system32\drivers\cirrus.sys file and copy the
Cirrus.sys file with the different size and date from Service Pack 4 downloaded
from the Microsoft FTP server.
