PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbualink97

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a hyperlink using the Field dialog box on the Insert menu, the
hyperlink display text is displayed incorrectly. For example, if you insert this
field:

   {Hyperlink "C:\Windows\Desktop\Test1.html"}

one or more back slashes are missing in the display text, so the hyperlink field
result looks like this:

   c:\windows\desktoptest1.html

If you try to activate the link, you receive the following error message:

   Cannot open the specified file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem and create a working hyperlink, use one of the
following methods:

Method 1
--------

In the Field dialog box, type two back slashes in the path so that the Field
Codes box contains the following information, and then click OK.

   Hyperlink "c:\\windows\\desktop\\test1.html"

Method 2
--------

Click Hyperlink on the Insert menu, type the file or URL in the "Link to File or
URL" box, and then click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
