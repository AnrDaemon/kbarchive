TITLE   :HOWTO: Determine FileFormat Values for Excel SaveAs Method

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual Basic for Excel Help often specifies constant names rather than values to
be used in calling object methods. When performing OLE Automation from Visual
FoxPro, FoxPro does not understand these constants and, therefore, requires
their initial values.

Below are the steps used to determine what the constant value is for a specific
file format to be used for the FileFormat portion of the SaveAs method.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Create a worksheet in Excel and save it in the format that you want. Make
   sure that you close the file before continuing.

2. Issue the following commands in Visual FoxPro:

         * First get an object reference to the Excel application
         oXL = CREATEOBJECT("Excel.Application")  && starts excel

         * Open the worksheet created in step 1 (be sure to include
         * the full path and file name
         oXL.WorkBooks.Add("myfile.xls")

         * Retrieve the FileFormat
         nFileFormat = oXL.WorkBooks(1).FileFormat

         * Save the file under a new name with the same format
         oXL.WorkBooks(1).SaveAs("new.xls",nFileFormat)

         * Quit Excel
         oXL.Quit

         * Release the object reference
         RELEASE oXL
