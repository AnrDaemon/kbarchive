   an exception.

This error can be trapped and avoided.

On Win16, you might see:

   MDSIP - An error has occurred in your application. If you choose Ignore, you
   should save your work in a new file. If you choose Close, your application
   will terminate.

If you click Ignore, you will see the following:

   Application error. MDISP caused a GPF in module MDISP.EXE at 0002:093F.

If you click Close, you will see:

   Run time error '-2147418105 (80010007' OLE Automation error.

You can click OK and the application will terminate.

If you click Close after the initial error, the following error will be
displayed:

and then the application will terminate. This cannot be trapped.
