MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Word 97 for Windows allows the insertion of Pictures as either
"Inline" or "Floating." Inline pictures are positioned directly in the text at
the insertion point. Floating pictures are inserted in the drawing layer so you
can position them precisely on the page or in front of or behind text or other
objects.

Word 97 also provides more control of picture attributes. Examples are Image
Control, Contrast, Brightness, Fill Color, Scaling, and Cropping.

Certain attributes are not saved to Inline pictures if Fast Saves is enabled. If
Fast Saves is disabled, then Word 97 correctly saves changes to Inline
pictures.

Word 97 correctly saves all changes to floating pictures.

What doesn't get fast saved:

 - Image Control (GreyScale, Black & White and WaterMark)

 - More Contrast

 - Less Contrast

 - More Brightness

 - Less Brightness

 - Fill Color

What does get fast saved:

 - Scaling

 - Cropping

 - Changes made to the picture when it's loaded into Word's drawing layer
