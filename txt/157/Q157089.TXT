                                          converted to boxes with wrap

                                          be text boxes with text
                                          overlapping. In most cases,
                                          these boxes become drawing layer
                                          objects in Word. Graphic lines
                                          become solid lines. Text that is

                                          becomes square-wrapped. Note:
                                          there may be a combination of
                                          attributes that cause
                                          inconsistent conversion.

                                          characters are converted. If one
