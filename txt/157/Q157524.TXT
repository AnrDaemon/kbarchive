TITLE   :PRB: Intellidrop Causes Multiple Logins with Remote View
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Each time you drag and drop a field from a Remote View to a Form or Report, the
server Login dialog box is invoked.

CAUSE
=====

The server login information for the remote view is not cached; it is
dynamically retrieved as needed.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the Remote View is based on datasource, issue the USE command to open the
Remote View first. Then when you drag and drop fields, Intellidrop can get the
information from the opened view.

-or-

Create the Remote View based on a Connection instead of a datasource. Then when
you drag and drop fields, Intellidrop can get the login information from the
connection and does not prompt for the server login again.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a database.

2. Create a Remote View in the database.

3. Create a form.

4. Add the previously created Remote View to the DataEnvironment of the new
   form.

5. Drag a field from the Remote View in the DataEnvironment to the form.

6. Drag another field to the form.

When the first field is dragged to the form, the server login dialog box appears.
When the second field is dragged on to the form, the server login dialog box
comes up again.
