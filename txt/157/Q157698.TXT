TITLE   :XCON: Exchange Fails to Allow an Incoming X.25 Connection
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP1,4.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) might fail to receive an
inbound X.25 connection due to an incorrect X.121 address. This can occur even
though the X.121 addresses match on both sides of the connection.

CAUSE
=====

The MTA improperly overwrites the inbound X.121 Address field with the incoming
Facilities Data field. This causes the X.121 addresses not to match when a
session attempt is made. Thus, the X.25 listen will fail if Facilities Data is
configured inbound.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the Facilities Call Data field does not have to be used, the field can be
left blank and the inbound X.121 address will be unaffected.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
