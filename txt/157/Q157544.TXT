WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this feature, use one of the following methods:

Method 1: Change the Text Box Size
----------------------------------

Increase the size of your existing text boxes to hold more text without the need
for additional linked text boxes.

1. Click the text box whose size you want to change.

2. Drag a sizing handle until the text box is the size you want.

Method 2: Change the Text Point Size
------------------------------------

Decrease the point size of the text in the linked text boxes.


MORE INFORMATION
================

You can link two or more text boxes so that text flows between them as you type.
You can also create text box links among shapes, such as circles, banners, and
flow chart shapes. A text box or shape can have only one forward, or next, link
and one backward, or previous, link. The maximum number of links you can have in
one sequence is 31, linking together 32 text boxes or shapes.

For more information about linking text boxes:

Click the Office Assistant, type "How do I link text boxes?", and then click
Search. Click the topic "Flow text to another part of my document with linked
text boxes".
