TITLE   :XFOR: Lowercase Address Types in Dir-Sync with Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5

SUMMARY
=======

The address type parameter (that is, SMTP, PCM, SNADS, and so forth) in a
directory synchronization (dir-sync) transaction is not case sensitive, by
definition.

A Microsoft Mail postoffice sends all its transaction address types in
uppercase.

Microsoft Exchange Server sends all its transaction address types in lowercase.

Both Microsoft Mail and Microsoft Exchange Server read these transactions without
sensitivity to case. Some third-party dir-sync requesters are sensitive to the
case of the address type parameter and incorrectly expect it to be uppercase.
