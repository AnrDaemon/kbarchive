-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Word to browse a World Wide Web page that has a horizontal rule,
the horizontal rule appears to be approximately 6.5 inches long and is aligned
to the left. In contrast, when you view the same page in a Web browser, such as
Internet Explorer, the length of the horizontal rule is the full width of the
screen.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the converter that Word uses to view a Hypertext
Markup Language (HTML) document assigns a fixed width for a horizontal rule
because it can not determine the width of the Word window.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

When you browse Web pages in Word, the widths of other elements, such as tables
and marquees, are also limited to 6.5 inches.
