TITLE   :Remote Mail Disconnects After Downloading Headers
PRODUCT :The Microsoft Network
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.2,1.3,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network versions 1.2, 1.3, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Remote Mail feature of Microsoft Exchange to download headers
from MSN, The Microsoft Network, you may be disconnected from MSN even though
you have not enabled the "Disconnect after updating headers from remote mail"
option.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, start MSN and then use Remote Mail to down- load
headers. Note that you need to either open Microsoft Exchange and then start MSN
or disable the "Download mail when e-mail starts up from MSN" option to avoid
having mail automatically downloaded.
