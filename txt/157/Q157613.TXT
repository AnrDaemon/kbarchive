SYMPTOMS
========

When you save a Word 97 document that contains bullet characters to Word for the
Macintosh 5.x format, and then reopen the document in Word 97, the bullets
display as boxes. The document opens correctly in Word for the Macintosh 5.x.
However, if you edit and save the document in Word for the Macintosh 5.x format
and then reopen it in Word 97, the bullets display as boxes. This problem occurs
in Word 97 when you apply bullets using the Bullet button on the Formatting
toolbar, or when you choose the Symbol command on the Insert menu and select the
Symbol font.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, choose the appropriate method:

Method 1. In Word 97, create the bullets using the Symbol command on the Insert
menu and the normal text font.

Method 2. After you open the document in Word for the Macintosh and make changes,
save the document in Interchange Format (RTF).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
