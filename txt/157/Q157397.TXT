TITLE   :WD97: Can't Access Form Properties With Frame Control
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta kbdtacode word8 word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Visual Basic Editor to insert a Frame control that covers an
entire UserForm, you cannot access the properties for the form.

Note that the Object box does not list the UserForm property sheet if the frame
is selected, even when the Frame control does not cover the entire form.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, resize the frame control using one of the following
methods.

Method 1: Resize the Frame Control by Changing Property Values
--------------------------------------------------------------

If the frame control extends to the boundary of the form, change the value for
the height or width in the properties window and then, click the form to access
the properties window for the form.

Method 2: Resize the Frame Using the Resizing Handles
-----------------------------------------------------

If you see the sizing handles of the frame control, resize the frame by dragging
the sizing handles inward. Then, click the form to access the properties window
for the form.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
