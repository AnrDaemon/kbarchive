TITLE   :SMS: Network Adapter Card Information Not Detected
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbnetwork kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When Systems Management Server inventory is run on some computers running
Windows NT, the network card MAC address, configuration information, and IP
address information may not be reported. This will result in either blank or
NULL information being reported in the personal computer Properties for that
system.

CAUSE
=====

Systems Management Server inventories computers running Windows NT by querying
the Windows NT registry. If the Netcard entry in the registry is not the first
entry, Systems Management Server will not find the information. This problem may
occur if there is one or more RAS adapters installed on the system. This problem
may also occur if a network card had been replaced in the system. When Windows
NT installs a new network card, it adds the new information in the registry with
a new entry. It does not reuse an existing entry.

For example, when a network card is first installed, a registry entry will be
created as "Netcard1". If this network card is then replaced, or if other
network cards are installed and this one is removed, the new network cards will
be named "Netcard2," Netcard3," "Netcard4," and so on.

Systems Management Server inventory currently does not scan through these
additional entries to find the new network card information.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining
the Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
