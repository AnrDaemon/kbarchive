======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using DirectDraw YUV surfaces, the Matrox Millennium video adapter
sometimes erroneously displays bright blue pixels after the conversion to RGB
space. This is most likely to occur when you are playing ActiveMovie videos.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by a hardware saturation problem that occurs during the
conversion.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can work around this problem in ActiveMovie by clicking the Advanced tab in
the ActiveMovie Control Properties dialog box, clicking Properties, clicking the
DirectDraw tab, and then disabling the YUV Offscreen option.

NOTE: The resolution setting is NOT in the retail product.
