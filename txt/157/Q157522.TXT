======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual FoxPro 5.x and 6.0 for Windows setup no longer supports the
administrative setup option (Setup /a). In previous versions of FoxPro, this
option allows FoxPro to run from a network file server. Although Visual FoxPro
5.x and 6.0 for Windows cannot be run from a file server, it may be useful to
have a network share from which users can install Visual FoxPro on to their
local computers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two ways of creating a common install point on the network for Visual
FoxPro:

 - A simple way is to share a networked CD-ROM. Everyone would be able to
   connect to the Visual FoxPro CD-ROM and run setup.

   -or-

 - Create a shared directory on the network and copy the contents of the CD-ROM
   to the directory. Make sure to mark all files read-only in the directory. The
   installation would be faster, but would take more hard drive space than
   option number 1.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.


NOTE: If available disk space is a consideration, perform the minimal product
installation and use the example files and online documentation through the
shared network directory or shared CD-ROM.
