Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a report in Report Designer.

2. Add the \Samples\Data\Customer.dbf table to the DataEnvironment.

3. Add a couple of fields from the customer table to the report.

4. Save the report as Test.frx and close the Report Designer.

5. In the Command window, type the following:

   " REPORT FORM TEST FOR Country = "USA" PREVIEW. " (without the quotation
   marks)

   NOTE: The Preview window comes up with only those records that have Country =
   "USA."

The entire report prints out instead of only those records that have Country =
"USA."
