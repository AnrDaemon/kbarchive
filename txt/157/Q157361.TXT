The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to automatically log on to a Windows NT 4.0- based
computer after an unattended Setup. By default, Setup restarts the computer and
waits for user input at the Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE To Log On dialog box after an
unattended Setup. The method in this article allows Windows NT 4.0 to
automatically process the logon using the Administrator account to provide
access to the desktop without user intervention. Note that this works only on
the initial logon after Windows NT 4.0 Setup is finished.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To enable automatic logon during unattended Setup, follow these steps:

1. Create a new share on a network server and then copy the i386 folder (or
   appropriate platform folder) from the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM to the new share.

2. Using any text editor (such as Notepad), add the following entry to the
   [Unattended] section of the Unattend.txt file:

         OEMPreinstall = Yes

3. Add the following entry to the [GUIUnattended] section of the Unattend.txt
   file:

         OEMBlankAdminPassword = 1

   For additional information about parameters for the Unattend.txt file, please
   see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q155197 Unattended Setup Parameters for Unattend.txt File

4. Save and then close the Unattend.txt file.

5. Create a new folder named $OEM$ in the share you created in step 1.

6. In the $OEM$ folder, create a file with the following entries. Save the file
   as <filename>.inf, where <filename> is your choice of names, for
   example, Mychange.inf.

         [Version]
         Signature = "$Windows NT$"

         [DefaultInstall]
         AddReg = AddReg

         [AddReg]
         HKLM,"SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
            \Winlogon","DefaultUserName",,"administrator"
         HKLM,"SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
            \Winlogon","DefaultPassword",,""
         HKLM,"SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
            \Winlogon","AutoAdminLogon",,"1"

   NOTE: These lines should be continuous. They were wrapped and indented for
   ease of readability.

   The below line is used to control the default Domain/Machine name to logon
   too. If using unattended setup to JOIN a domain. The default is the domain
   name. Add this line if you want to logon to the machine name, for example,
   machine name is MACHINENAME:

         HKLM,"SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
            NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon","DefaultDomainName",,"Machinename"

7. In the $OEM$ folder, create a file named Cmdlines.txt. This file should
   contain the following entries including the quotation marks surrounding the
   entry:

         [Commands]
         "rundll32 setupapi,InstallHinfSection DefaultInstall 128
            .\<filename>.inf"

   NOTE: This line should be continuous. It was wrapped and indented for ease of
   readability. The .\ stands for current directory and there should be a space
   after 128.

   Make sure to replace <filename> in this line with the name of the file
   you created in step 6.
