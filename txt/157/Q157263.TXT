The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to install a default screen saver and settings using
the Msbatch.inf file for batch installations of Windows 95.

Note: Due to limitations of batch file installations, it is not possible to set
up the screen saver password with a batch installation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft does not encourage or support changes to .inf files; therefore,
Microsoft Technical Support does not support the procedure in this article.
Although we have tested the following procedure and it appears to function as
described, make a backup copy of your .inf file before you proceed.

NOTE: The following example only shows how to install the screen saver. The
screen saver itself must still be copied to the Windows\system folder for proper
functionality.

In the Msbatch.inf file, modify the [Install] section to include the following
lines:

   " UpdateInis=screensaver
   Addreg=screensaver.regm." (without the quotation marks)

Also, add the following sections and keys

   [screensaver]
   %10%\system.ini,Boot,,"SCRNSAVE.EXE=c:\windows\System\<name>"

   [screensaver.reg]
   HKCU,"Control Panel\desktop",ScreenSaveActive,,"1"
   HKCU,"Control Panel\desktop",ScreenSaveLowPowerActive,,"0"
   HKCU,"Control Panel\desktop",ScreenSaveLowPowerTimeout,,"n"
   HKCU,"Control Panel\desktop",ScreenSavePowerOffActive,,"n"
   HKCU,"Control Panel\desktop",ScreenSavePowerOffTimeout,,"n"
   HKCU,"Control Panel\desktop",ScreenSaveTimeOut,,"<n>"

where <name> is the name of the screen saver and <n> is the delay
time before the screen saver starts.
