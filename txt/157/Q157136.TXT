SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a video clip object from the Clip Gallery into a document, the
image appears with a video control bar that displays the file name. The video
controls do not appear on the image. When you play the video, the video controls
appear at the bottom of the image.

NOTE: If you save the document in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) format,
the image becomes static and you can no longer run the video clip.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, insert a video file using the following steps:

1. On the Insert menu, click Video.

2. In the Video Clip dialog box, type the name of the video clip in the Video
   box. Or, click Browse, select a video file, and click OK.

3. Click OK.

NOTE: Your World Wide Web browser must support inline video to properly display
and play the video file.

======
