TITLE   :WD97: Can't Redefine Normal Style from Style Box
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbualink97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Word 97, when you use the Style box on the Formatting toolbar to redefine the
Normal style, Word applies the Normal style that you previously defined to
selected text. Word does not prompt you to redefine the Normal style and
overwrites any formatting changes you applied to the text.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when you use the following steps:

1. Select text to which you applied the Normal style.

2. Apply new formatting to the text.

3. Click the Style box on the Formatting toolbar and press ENTER.

Word 97 does not allow you to redefine the Normal style with the Style box. This
functionality is different from earlier versions of Word.

NOTE: This behavior does not occur when you use the Style box to modify other
styles in Word 97.

WORKAROUND
==========

To redefine the Normal style, do the following:

1. On the Format menu, click Style.

2. In the Styles box, select the style you want to change and click Modify.

3. Select the Add to Template check box if you want to permanently redefine the
   Normal style.

4. Click Format, and then click the attribute, such as Font or Paragraph, you
   want to change.

5. Click OK twice.

6. Click Close.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is a design change that is intended to reduce problems associated
with modifying the Normal style. Because most of the default styles, including
the Header, Footer, Footnote Text, Heading styles, and so on, are based on the
Normal style, when you redefine the Normal style, all of these styles are also
redefined.
