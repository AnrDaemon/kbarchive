TITLE   :WD97: No Warning When You Edit EPS Image (Image Converted)
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbualink97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you double-click an EPS picture in a Word document, you do not get a
warning message indicating the picture contains embedded PostScript information.
If you convert the picture to a Drawing Object, you lose the PostScript
information in the file and the picture will not print to a PostScript printer.

This problem occurs when you attempt to edit an EPS image stored in a document
converted from Word 6.x or 7.x. This problem does not occur when you insert the
image into a Word 97 document and then attempt to edit the image.


CAUSE
=====

The Word 97 EPS graphics filter is not analyzing the embedded image to determine
whether it contains embedded PostScript information.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, insert or reinsert the PostScript image in the
document after you convert it to Word 97.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.


This problem has been corrected in Word 2000.
