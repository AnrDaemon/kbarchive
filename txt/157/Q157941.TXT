TITLE   :XFOR: Attachment Moved When Sent Over MS Mail Connector
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use an English Microsoft Mail client running on Korean Windows 3.1 to
send a message containing Korean characters to another English Microsoft Mail
client running on Korean Windows 3.1, the Korean characters can be viewed
correctly by the recipient. However, when the message contains an attachment and
it is sent from a Korean Microsoft Exchange client running on Korean Windows NT
3.51 to an English Microsoft Mail client running on Korean Windows 3.1, the
attachment's position in the message is modified and some Korean characters will
be garbled. This occurs when the Microsoft Exchange MS Mail Connector is used to
connect English Microsoft Mail to Microsoft Exchange Server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word

MORE INFORMATION

Mail client running on Korean Windows 3.1 and a Korean Microsoft Exchange client
through the Microsoft Exchange MS Mail Connector, the Primary Language for
Clients property of the Microsoft Exchange MS Mail Connector must be set to
Korean(v3.1a/US).
