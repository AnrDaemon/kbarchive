======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to pass IP broadcasts, such as DHCP, over a Token Ring
transparent bridge, you may receive the following error message:

   The DHCP client was unable to obtain an IP network address from a DHCP
   server.

Or, you may be unable to resolve names of computers on the other side of the
bridge.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95-based computers set the Source Routing (SR) bit in all IP broadcast
traffic by default. Transparent bridges may discard frames with Source Routing
information when passing them to different media types (such as Ethernet).

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.
