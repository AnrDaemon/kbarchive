-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+, versions 1.0, 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Schedule+ 7.0 tracks the responses from requested attendees and changes the icon
in the Meeting property page accordingly. When a meeting request is first sent
out from Schedule+ 7.0, the Edit Item under Edit on the Attendees tab will have
a "?" icon next to each invited attendee's name. As the results come back,
either Accepted or Denied, this icon changes to a check mark or "x" icon
accordingly.

The tracking method used to determine which appointment the replies are
associated with has changed from Schedule+ 1.0 to Schedule+ 7.0. Therefore, when
Schedule+ 7.0 receives a response to a meeting that it cannot match up to the
meeting ID from the response and to a valid meeting ID in its calendar file, it
will attempt to match it by comparing the Subject line of the response to the
Description field of its meetings.

Therefore, when operating in a mixed environment of Schedule+ 7.0 users and
Schedule+ 1.0 users, it is recommended that the Subject line not be changed from
the description of the meeting. By default, when a new meeting request is
created, the Subject field is the same as the description of the meeting.
