The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Running the Microsoft Mail Administrator program under an MS-DOS virtual machine
(VDM) is supported; however, just as with any application being run under a VDM,
it is susceptible to causing corruption to the postoffice under certain
situations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Any networked MS-DOS application that relies on the sophisticated file I/O
caching of a VDM could potentially experience file corruption because of one of
the following:

 - Closing the VDM without properly closing down the MS-DOS application running
   in its window.

 - Ungracefully shutting the power down to a computer that has a running MS-DOS
   application under a VDM.

 - Faulty networking hardware or network card device drivers that do not
   properly handle I/O requests from the network and return improper values to
   the MS-DOS application.

When you run the Microsoft Mail Administrator program under a VDM in Microsoft
Windows, Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95, or Windows NT, the following rules
should be followed to prevent any corruption to the Microsoft Mail 3.x
postoffice database files:

 - Always shut down the Administrator program by first pressing the ESCAPE (ESC)
   key, and then pressing Y, and then closing the VDM window.

 - If you are experiencing problems performing normal Administrator functions
   under a VDM, try performing the same task in a VDM on another workstation or
   from a native MS-DOS workstation.

 - If the problems persist, contact Microsoft Technical Support.
