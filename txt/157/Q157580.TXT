MORE INFORMATION
================

The appearance of the wizards for Microsoft Word 97 for Windows has changed.
There are six Word wizards that provide a progress indicator on the left side of
the wizard window. The top of the indicator has Start and the bottom of the
indicator has Finish. The wizard indicator visually identifies the current step
in the wizard process. It also indicates how many steps remain in the wizard
process.

Certain font/color combinations can make the word Finish invisible on the wizard
progress indicator.

There are six wizards provided in Word that use the progress indicator. They are:
Agenda Wizard, Calendar Wizard, Fax Wizard, Newsletter Wizard, Pleading Wizard,
and the Resume Wizard.

There are two wizards that exhibit this problem. They are the Agenda Wizard and
the Resume Wizard. The other wizards display the word Finish correctly.
