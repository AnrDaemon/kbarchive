TITLE   :XCON: Microsoft Exchange will not Allow Incoming X.25 Connection
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) receives an inbound
X.25 connection, it mail refuse the connection due to an incorrect X.121 address
even though the addresses match on both sides.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 improperly overwrites the inbound X.121
address field with the Incoming Facilities Data field and this causes the X.121
addresses not to match when a session attempt is made.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the Facilities Call Data field does not have to be used, the field can be
left blank and the inbound X.121 address will be unaffected.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
Exchange. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0 Server
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
