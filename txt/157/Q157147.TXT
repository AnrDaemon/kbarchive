-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 2000 version of this article, see Q205466.

For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q194353.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Network Test (FrontPage 97) or the TCP/IP Test (FrontPage 1.1),
"No" is returned on one or more tests even though other Internet applications
run without error. The FrontPage 1.0 TCP/IP Test returns:

   "Fail" under similar circumstances.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because FrontPage uses more of the Winsock features than
most Internet applications. Unlike most Internet applications, FrontPage not
only browses and retrieves files via Winsock, it also requires your computer to
act as a Web server.

Not every third party TCP/IP stack includes all of the industry standard Winsock
API calls. Therefore, if the TCP/IP test fails, FrontPage will be unable to work
with that particular stack.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the TCP/IP Test or Network Test begins, it loads the Wsock32.dll and then
it looks for clear entry points. If the test does not locate any clear entry
points, the test calls the WSAStartup startup routine, which is one of the entry
points found, and it requests version 1.1 or higher of the Winsock API.

The TCP/IP test or Network Test then attempts to execute the following Winsock
API calls:

   WSACleanup
   socket
   inet_addr
   inet_ntoa
   bind
   listen
   getsockname
   connect
   accept
   send
   recv
   closesocket
   gethostname
   gethostbyname

FrontPage will work only with third-party TCP/IP stacks that properly support all
of these API calls.

For more information about the Microsoft TCP/IP stack, please see the following

Winsock is the common name for the Windows Sockets Interface Specification. This
specification defines a network programming interface for Microsoft Windows
which is based on the "socket" paradigm popularized in the Berkeley Software
Distribution (BSD) from the University of California at Berkeley. It encompasses
both Berkeley socket style routines and a set of Windows specific extensions
designed to allow a programmer to take advantage of the message-driven nature of
Windows.
