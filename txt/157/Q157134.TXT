======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you select the 3-D preset border style, Word displays all line styles
including those that do not apply a 3-D border. For example, if you select one
of the first twenty line styles in the Style list box, Word applies a
one-dimensional border to your page even though you clicked the 3-D preset. (To
locate this option, click Borders and Shading on the Format menu and click the
Page Border tab.)

CAUSE
=====

Word does not display a list of line styles based on the type of preset you
select. The 3-D preset works only with special line styles. Currently, you can
apply a 3-D border using either of the last two line styles in the Borders and
Shading Dialog box.

WORKAROUND
==========

To apply a 3-D page border, select one of the last two styles in the Style list
box in the Borders and Shading Dialog box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
