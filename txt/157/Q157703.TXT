OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send messages using the WordMail editor, to a recipient who is not
defined to receive failure notifications from the Microsoft Exchange Internet
Mail Connector (IMC), the IMC will record an error message in the Event Log
stating that the Non-Delivery Report (NDR) could not be delivered because the
message could not be saved. If you use a mailbox that is defined to receive IMC
notifications, you will see a failure notice from the Microsoft Exchange System
Administrator stating that the message was malformed.

The originator will never be notified that the message was not sent.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
