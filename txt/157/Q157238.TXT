To activate security event logging, follow these steps:

1. Log on as the administrator of the local workstation.

2. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and
   then click User Manager.

3. On the Policies menu, click Audit.

4. Click the Audit These Events option.

      Note: Files and folders must reside on an NTFS partition for security

    - Restart, Shutdown, And System: Logs shutdowns and restarts for the local
      workstation.

    - Process Tracking: Tracks program activation, handle duplication, indirect
      object access, and process exit.
