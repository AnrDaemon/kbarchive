SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to determine the version of Microsoft DirectX
installed on your computer using the DirectX Diagnostic Tool.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use the DirectX Diagnostic Tool to determine the version of DirectX that is
installed on your computer, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. Type "dxdiag" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

3. On the System tab, note the version of DirectX displayed on the DirectX
   Version line.

4. On the DirectX Files tab, check the version information for each DirectX
   file.

5. When you are finished checking file versions, click Exit.

If Windows cannot find the dxdiag program, DirectX version 5.0 or earlier is
installed on your computer. If this is the case, download and install the
current version of DirectX.
