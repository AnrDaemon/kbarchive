TITLE   :SMS: Hardware Inventory May Be Skipped
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbInventory smsinvkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the Software Scan Interval is set to something less than the Hardware Scan
Interval, hardware inventory will never be performed. Every time software
inventory is performed, both the LastSoftwareScan and LastHardwareScan times are
updated, even when hardware inventory is not performed.

CAUSE
=====

Software inventory depends on knowing what hard disk drives are present on the
system. The hardware inventory normally provides this information. If it is not
time to do a full hardware inventory, then only the hard disk drive's test
portion of the hardware inventory is performed. However, because this section of
the hardware inventory is performed, the LastHardwareScan time is updated.
Because this time is updated every time software inventory is performed, enough
time never elapses for the full hardware inventory to be done.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, set the HardwareScanInterval to the same or smaller
interval as the SoftwareScanInterval; for example, perform hardware inventory as
frequently as (or more frequently than) software inventory is performed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server version 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
