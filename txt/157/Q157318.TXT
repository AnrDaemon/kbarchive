TITLE   :DOCERR: Function Key Information Incorrect in VFP 5.0 Help
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

There is incorrect information for the function keys F2 to F9, in the "Keyboard
differences between dBASE and Visual FoxPro" Help topic in Visual FoxPro 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The topic "Keyboard differences between dBASE and Visual FoxPro" in the Visual
FoxPro Help file shows the following actions associated with the F2 through F9
function keys in the section titled "Visual FoxPro and dBASE Function Key
Assignments":

   F2   Set (displays the View window)
   F3   List
   F4   Dir(ectory)
   F5   Display Structure
   F6   Display Status
   F7   Display Memory
   F8   Display
   F9   Append

This information is incorrect. The function keys F2 to F9 are ignored by default
and do not perform the actions described in the Help topic. This functionality
is provided by a Default.fky macro file, which is no longer provided. This
functionality was removed because some of these keys are now used by the FoxPro
Debugger, as shown in the list below:

   F5         Resume
   F6         Step Over
   F7         Run to Cursor
   Shift+F7   Step Out
   F8         Step Into

For more information about keyboard shortcuts in the Debugger, search for
"Debugger Keyboard Shortcuts" in the Visual FoxPro Help file.

You can assign expressions to the functions keys F2 to F9, in the configuration
file (Config.fpw) so that they perform the actions described in the Help topic.

functionality, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
