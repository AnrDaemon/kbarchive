TITLE   :Ntbackup.exe Generates Error Using 4-Character Description
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the /d switch as part of the syntax for the NTBACKUP command, you may
receive the following error message:

   An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
   generated.

   Ntbackup.exe

Ntbackup.exe then tries to log an error to the DrWatson.log file. If Dr. Watson
is not running, the following error message appears:

   Cannot Open DrWatson.log File
   Press OK to Browse for new directory
   Windows NT Error Code = 3

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if you use a description with four characters, or if the
fifth character in the description is a space (for example, "Full Backup").

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, use a description with more or less than four
characters, or without a space as the fifth character.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT version
4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
