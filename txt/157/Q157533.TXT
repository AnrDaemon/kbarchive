======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0a 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0a 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running PVCS_SS.EXE to convert a PVCS database to a SourceSafe database,
the conversion does not complete. This process does not return any error
messages.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add these lines to AUTOEXEC.BAT:

      set libpath = <path to the DLLs used by the GET program,
                    such as c:\pvcs\dll>

      set vcsid  = <userid>

      set vcscfg = <path to configuration file>

      set intrsolvdir = <path to dir where license admin facility is>

NOTE: When you execute PVCS_SS *.*, meaning convert *all* of the files, it may
appear to hang as it apparently does a lot of initialization in PVCS.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. At a DOS prompt, switch to the directory containing the file PVCS_SS.EXE.
   This will vary depending on the version of SourceSafe and the kind of
   installation.

2. Type the command: " PVCS_SS *.* $/<newproject> " (without the quotation
   marks)

On screen and in the conversion log file, the following appears:

   PVCS_SS. Copyright... 7/25/95 12:42

There may be some other unusable information as well.

The PVCS data is converted to SourceSafe data.
