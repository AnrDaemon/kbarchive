PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbtemplate word97 kblayout kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a newsletter that you created using the Newsletter Wizard, the
footer and/or the bottom border does not print.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you click Page Setup on the File menu, click the
Margins tab, and type a value in the Footer box that is outside the printable
range for the printer.

For example, this problem occurs when you type a value of .24 inch in the Footer
box, and then print to a Hewlett-Packard DeskJet printer. The position is
outside of the printable range because the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet printer
cannot print a footer that is positioned lower than .67 inch from the edge of
the paper.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, increase the value in the Footer box. To do this,
use the following steps:

1. On the File menu, click Page Setup.

2. Click the Margins tab.

3. In the Footer box under From Edge, type a larger value and click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
