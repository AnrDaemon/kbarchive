TITLE   :BUG: Report Form Fields Appear to Be Selected After Printing
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When printing from Visual FoxPro 5.0 or 6.0, the Report Form fields appear
selected after the print job has finished.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When printing from Visual FoxPro 5.0 or 6.0, the Report Form fields appear to
have selection handles on them after the print job has been spooled; however,
the fields are not actually selected. Refreshing the Report Form by moving it
off and then back onto the desktop removes the selection handles.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Quick Report using a table of your choice.

2. Print the report to the selected printer.

3. Observe that all fields on the Report Form appear to be selected.

4. When you move the Report Form from and then back to the desktop, the form
   refreshes.
