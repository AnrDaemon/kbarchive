TITLE   :XCLN: PRC Exchange Win 95 Client cannot Display DBCS Characters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the PRC version of the Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client,
any file with Double Byte Character Set (DBCS) characters will have corrupted
characters in it. You can see this by opening the Gbk.txt file supplied in the
\Windows directory. The Gbk.txt file contains all of the characters defined for
the system.

CAUSE
=====

When the Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client is installed, it replaces the
Riched32.dll with it's own version. The Microsoft Exchange version incorrectly
displays some of the DBCS characters.


WORKAROUND
==========

Replace the Microsoft Exchange client version of riched32.dll with the one that
came with Windows 95. Then Gbk.txt will open properly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange clients,
version 4.0, listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected
in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S. Service Pack 4. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
