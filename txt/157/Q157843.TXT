The AutoText submenus are created with styles. To add a new AutoText submenu,
create a new style name.

The AutoText drop-down lists are created with text that has been formatted with
the appropriate style name and saved as an AutoText entry.

For example: The submenu "Subject Line" is a style name. The drop-down "Subject:"
is text that has the "Subject Line" style applied to it.

To create AutoText entries that appear in the AutoText drop-down list, first
create a style, and then create an AutoText entry using the new style.

To Create a New AutoText Entry in the AutoText Drop-Down List
-------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The following steps will add a new AutoText entry to the AutoText drop-down
list in your Normal.dot template (the default template in Word). If you want
your AutoText entry available only when you are working from a particular
template, then open the template file before proceeding with the following
steps.

1. You can use either an existing style, or you can use the following steps to
   create a new style for your AutoText entry:

   a. On the Format menu, click Style.

   b. Click the New button.

   c. In the Name box, type a name for your new AutoText style, and then click
      to select the Add To Template check box.

   d. Use the Format button to make any formatting changes, and then click OK.

   e. Click Close.

2. To create a new AutoText drop-down list with one entry, follow these steps:

   a. Type the item you want to add to the AutoText drop-down list.

   b. Select the item.

   c. Apply the style you created in Step 1, or use an existing style.

   d. On the Insert menu, point to AutoText, and click New.

   e. Type a unique name for the AutoText entry and click OK.

The style you created in step 1 appears on the AutoText submenu, and the AutoText
entry you created in step 2 appears in the AutoText drop-down list. To add
additional entries to your AutoText submenu, repeat steps 2a- 2e for each new
entry.

To Change the Name of an Existing AutoText Submenu
--------------------------------------------------

When you add a new AutoText submenu (for example, when you use the steps in the
"To Create a New AutoText Entry in the AutoText Drop-Down List" section of this
article), the submenu is created as a result of a style. This style is actually
stored as part of the AutoText entry, and will remain as part of the AutoText
entry even if the style is renamed or deleted from the document or template.
Note that the AutoText submenu does not appear on the AutoText list in the
Organizer. It is not possible to rename the AutoText submenu. You must delete
the AutoText entries that reside under the AutoText submenu, and you must then
create a new AutoText submenu using a different or renamed style.

To Delete an Existing AutoText Submenu and Its Entries
------------------------------------------------------

To delete an AutoText submenu and its entries, follow these steps:

1. On the Insert menu, point to AutoText, and then click AutoText.

2. On the AutoText tab, click to select the AutoText entry that appears under
   the AutoText submenu, and then click Delete. Repeat this step for each of the
   AutoText entries that appear on the AutoText submenu, and then click OK.

NOTE: Once you have deleted the last AutoText entry under an AutoText submenu,
the submenu will be removed from the AutoText drop-down list.

To Use the AutoTextList Field
-----------------------------

The AutoTextList field is a new field in Word 97 that displays a list of AutoText
entries formatted with the same style as the field code. The field uses the
following syntax:

   {AUTOTEXTLIST "<LiteralText>" \s ["<StyleName>"] \t ["<TipText>"]}

   Instruction         Explanation
   -------------------------------

   "<LiteralText>"     Text that appears in the document before the user
                       displays the drop-down list. If the text contains
                       spaces, enclose it in quotation marks.

   "<StyleName>"       The name of the style of the AutoText entries that
                       you want to appear in the list. If the style name
                       contains spaces, enclose it in quotation marks.

   "<TipText>"         Text that appears in the screen tip when the mouse
                       pointer hovers over the field result. Enclose the
                       text in quotation marks.

   Switches            Explanation
   --------            -----------

   \s                  Specifies that the list will contain entries based
                       on a specific style. Without this switch, AutoText
                       entries of the current paragraph style appear. If
                       there are no entries for the current style, all
                       AutoText entries appear.

   \t                  Specifies unique text to show in the screen tip
                       instead of the default tip.

To Create the AutoTextList Field
--------------------------------

To create the AutoTextList field, follow these steps:

1. On the Insert menu, click Field.

2. Under Categories, click Links And References.

3. Under Field Names, click AutoTextList.

4. Click after the field name in the Field Codes box, and then type the text you
   want to appear on the screen within quotation marks, for example, type:

   "Sign Here"

5. Click the Options button.

6. Click the Field Specific Switches tab.

7. Under Switches, select the \s switch and click Add To Field.

8. Click OK.

9. In the Field Code box, type the name of the style in quotation marks--for
   example, type:

   "Signature"

10. Click Options.

11. Click the Field Specific Switches tab.

12. Under Switches, select the \t switch and click Add To Field.

13. In the Field Code box, type the tip text within quotation marks, for
   example, "Right-click to display list of Signature AutoText." The tip text
   will appear when the mouse pointer hovers over the AutoTextList field.

14. Click OK twice

When you right-click the AutoTextList field, Word displays a list of AutoText
entries formatted in the style you specified for the field. If you do not
specify a style when you create the AutoTextList field, Word displays all
AutoText entries.

Notes
-----

 - To display the AutoText toolbar, point to AutoText on the Insert menu, click
   AutoText, and then click Show Toolbar.

 - If you delete all of the AutoText entries using a specific style, the submenu
   for these AutoText entries will be removed from the AutoText menu.

ScreenTips
----------

To enable ScreenTips, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click AutoCorrect, and then click the AutoText tab.

2. Click to select the "Show AutoComplete tip for AutoText and dates" check box,
   and then click OK.
