TITLE   :SMS: Remote Control Doesn't Connect to 16-Bit SMS Clients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtshoot kbusage smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


Remote Control utilities and Remote Diagnostics will fail to connect to 16- bit
SMS clients if the machine name contains extended characters. Extended
characters are those beyond the first 127 in the ASCII character set.

NOTE: This problem does not occur on Windows NT clients.

CAUSE
=====

When a client has extended characters in its name, it registers the name on the
network as an OEM string. The Windows NT NetBIOS interface expects an ANSI
string, and Sightnt.dll uses ANSI strings for remote control.

WORKAROUND
==========

Change the machine name. NetBIOS names can contain characters between ASCII 33
and 126 inclusive except for the MS-DOS reserved characters such as the backward
and forward slashes, braces ({}), the greater than and less than signs, and so
forth.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
