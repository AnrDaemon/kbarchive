TITLE   :PRB: String Functions Cannot Be Used with SQL ORDER BY Clause
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp300 kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

String functions such as LEFT(), RIGHT(), and SUBSTR() cannot be used with the
ORDER BY clause of the SQL - SELECT statement. Doing so results in the following
error message:

   SQL Column '' is not found

CAUSE
=====

ORDER BY supports only columns either by name or number, it does not support any
other expressions.

WORKAROUND
==========

Create a dummy column using the string function and then order by that column,
as in the following example:

      SELECT *,LEFT(Prod_name,5) AS x FROM PRODUCTS ORDER BY x

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open Testdata database in the HOME()+"Samples\Data\" directory, for Visual
   FoxPro 6.0 goes to \\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio
   \Common\Samples\Data.

2. Issue the following command:

         SELECT * FROM Products ORDER BY LEFT(Prod_name,5)
