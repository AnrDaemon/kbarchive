TITLE   :Windows NT May Hang Using SNA Server 2.11 SP1 w/Digi Sync SDLC
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the new Digi Sync SDLC driver included with SNA Server 2.11 Service
Pack 1, the Microsoft Windows NT computer may hang (for example, mouse and
keyboard input has no effect) after the SDLC connection stays pending, if a
misconfigured modem or bad cable (either V.35 or RS-232, as appropriate) are
being used.

NOTE: The Digi Sync SDLC adapter supports either a V.35 or RS-232 interface. This
problem has been observed with either interface.


CAUSE
=====

The problem is being investigated by Digi Corporation.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem, the SDLC cable and modem should be checked for possible
misconfiguration. All reported cases of hang problems were due to either a
improper synchronous modem cable or misconfigured modem (for example, a modem
not configured for SDLC or synchronous operation).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server 2.11
Service Pack 1. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
