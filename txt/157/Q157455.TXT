======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Import Wizard in Visual FoxPro fails with the message "No fields were found
to copy" when trying to import a Microsoft Excel 5.0 workbook.

CAUSE
=====

The active sheet in the workbook is empty.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make the sheet with the data to be imported the active sheet when the Excel
workbook is saved.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Import Wizard looks at only the active sheet in the Excel workbook.

Another way to import a sheet from an Excel 5.0 workbook is to use the Import
command on the File menu. The dialog box displayed by the Import command has a
drop-down list box where you can choose a specific sheet from an Excel workbook.
Of course, the sheet containing the data would have to be known. The Import
command echoes the following command into the Visual FoxPro Command window
assuming an Excel file named Abc.xls and Sheet 7 is chosen in the Sheet
drop-down list box.

   IMPORT FROM abc.xls TYPE XL5 SHEET "Sheet7"

You can then issue this command either in the Command window or in a program.
