TITLE   :XFOR: Importing Large Numbers of MHS Addresses is Very Slow
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Importing large numbers of Message Handling Service (MHS) addresses is
excessively slow.

CAUSE
=====

A regular MHS address has the form mailbox@node. An extended MHS address has the
form placeholder@node{real address}. By default, the DXA parses against the
placeholder@node portion of the transaction record and attempts to create a
unique alias and proxies using this data.

Using the following example import file, you can see where the slowdown occurs.

   AUser AMHS:ServerA@Company{ccmail:usera}
   AUser BMHS:ServerA@Company{ccmail:userb}
   AUser CMHS:ServerA@Company{ccmail:userc}
   AUser DMHS:ServerA@Company{ccmail:userd}
   ...
   AUser AAAMHS:ServerA@Company{ccmail:useraaa}

WORKAROUND
==========

A hotfix is now available that provides a registry setting to tell the Directory
Synchronization service (DXA) to use the extended portion of an MHS address for
alias and proxy name generation.

NOTE: This hotfix will only parse SMTP and ccMAIL type addresses from the
extended address. From an SMTP address it will take the xxx out of an
xxx@yyy.com type address and from a ccMAIL address it will take the xxx out of a
CCMAIL:xxx type address.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
