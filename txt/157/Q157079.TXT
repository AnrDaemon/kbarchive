PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you configure a Microsoft Exchange client to use Offline Folders, by
default the OST file will be created in the Windows directory. After an OST has
been created, it can be moved by following these steps:

1. Exit and Log Off the Microsoft Exchange client.

2. Using the Windows File Manager or Explorer, locate the existing OST file,
   usually in the Windows directory.

3. Move the OST file to the new location.

4. Start the Microsoft Exchange client, either online or offline.

5. The following message will be displayed:

   The file C:\Windows\Exchange.OST could not be found.

   Click OK.

6. The Offline Folder Settings dialog box will be displayed. Click Browse and
   select the OST file in the new location.

7. Click OK.

The Microsoft Exchange client is now properly configured to work with the OST
file in the new location.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The location of the OST file can be set prior to installing the Microsoft
Exchange client by modifying the Default.prf file located in the installation
directory. For more detailed information about using the Setup Editor and
Default.prf, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q147352 XCLN: Creating Default User Profiles

In the section titled Microsoft Exchange Server, add an entry similar to the
following:

   [Microsoft Exchange Server]
   OfflineFolderPath=C:\Ostpath

This will create an Exchange.ost file in the C:\Ostpath directory during setup.
