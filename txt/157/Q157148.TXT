TITLE   :WD97: Newsletter Wizard Address Printed in Wrong Location
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtemplate word97 kblayout

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Newsletter Wizard, Word places the mailing and return address
information in the wrong location in relation to the fold of the printed
newsletter.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, run the wizard, and then move the address
information such that it prints above the fold when you fold the printed
document.

NOTE: The address information is placed inside a table. To move the address
information, select the table and then cut and paste the table to the
appropriate location above the fold of the printed newsletter.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Newsletter Wizard allows you to add mailing address information to the
newsletter. This is a feature that is not available in earlier versions of the
Newsletter Wizard.

The Newsletter Wizard places the mailing address information on the last page of
the document. When you fold the printed document, the address is located below
the fold.

According to U.S. Postal requirements, the bound edge must be the bottom edge of
the mailing piece, parallel to the lines of the delivery address. The top edge
of the mailing piece must be closed.
