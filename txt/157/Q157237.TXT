======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Changes made to the message format of a fax that is sent by printing to the Fax
printer do not affect the actual fax sent.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs because the fax has already been rendered. Changes made to the
message format have no effect. The paper size, print quality, and orientation
are all set by the program used to create the document.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 95. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here as it becomes available.
