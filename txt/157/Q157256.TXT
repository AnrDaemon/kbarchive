KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Incorrect Information is given about the DEBUG and SET DEBUG commands in the
Visual FoxPro 5.0 Help file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The topics "Unsupported dBASEIV Commands, Functions, and Clauses" and "DEBUG" in
the Visual FoxPro Help file incorrectly state the following:

   In Visual FoxPro, the dBASE DEBUG command generates an error.

However, the DEBUG command does not generate an error in Visual FoxPro 5.0, but
instead invokes the Visual FoxPro Debugger. For more information, search for
"DEBUG" in the Visual FoxPro Help file.

The topic "SET DEBUG" in the Visual FoxPro Help file states the following:

   Makes the Debug and Trace windows either available or unavailable from the
   Visual FoxPro menu system

In Visual FoxPro 5.0, SET DEBUG is always set to ON and cannot be changed to OFF.
The SET DEBUG OFF command is ignored by Visual FoxPro. SET("DEBUG") always
returns ON.
