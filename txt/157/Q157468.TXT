======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

CompareMemo is a new property added to the CursorSetProp command in Visual
FoxPro 5.0. CursorSetProp specifies property settings for a Visual FoxPro table
or cursor. The new CompareMemo property determines how conflicts are detected.
There have not been any other changes from Visual FoxPro 3.0 in the manner in
which memo fields are updated.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The new CompareMemo property determines how conflicts are detected during an
update. With CompareMemo set to .T. (the default), memo fields are included in
the WHERE clause for updates (the conflict detection behavior is the same as in
Visual FoxPro 3.0). When CompareMemo is set to .F., memo fields are not included
in the WHERE clause for updates and, therefore, are not checked for conflict
even though the WhereType is DB_KEYANDUPDATABLE or DB_KEYANDMODIFIED.

Additionally, General fields are not included in the WHERE clause under any
circumstance in Visual FoxPro 5.0 because many servers do not support comparison
of long type columns. Conflict detection on fields of all other types remains
the same as in Visual FoxPro 3.0.
