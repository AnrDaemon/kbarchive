SUMMARY
=======

Q. How can I get VSS and Visual InterDev integration working?

A. Visual InterDev uses FrontPage Server Extensions to integrate with Visual
SourceSafe through OLE Automation. It is important to note that the Visual
InterDev client does not need a Visual SourceSafe client for integration to
work. However, the web server does need to have the Visual SourceSafe and
FrontPage Server Extensions installed for the integration to work. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
