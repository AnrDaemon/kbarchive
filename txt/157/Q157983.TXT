SUMMARY
=======

When creating add-ins for Visual SourceSafe, several platform considerations
must be made when planning the design and functionality of the add-in OLE
server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Visual SourceSafe add-in model only supports the 32-bit Intel client. This
must be taken into consideration because add-ins that rely on receiving
SourceSafe events may not function properly when users operate from different
clients.

Unlike SQL Server or Exchange Server, SourceSafe OLE Automation does not process
on the server side. All of the processing is completed on the client machine. If
an add-in for SourceSafe is used, each client must have the add-in installed and
configured on a local machine.

There are several instances when the add-in will not receive SourceSafe events
and will not be able to process information:

 - If older versions of SourceSafe are used.

 - If the Command line is used, no events will be sent.

 - If the 16-bit client is used, no events will be sent.

 - If an operating system that does not support OLE is used, no events will be
   sent.

If event-critical add-ins are created (e-mail notification or local data
processing), some event data will be lost if SourceSafe is used in a mixed-
client environment. This should be taken into consideration during the
development and deployment stages of the add-in application.
