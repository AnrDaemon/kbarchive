PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Kids Products
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsgkbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Creative Writer 2, when you try to create a new document from one of the
templates, insert music, or change a theme, you may receive the following error
message:

   Could not open a piece of artwork...

CAUSE
=====

This error message may occur if your computer is using real mode drivers to
access the CD-ROM drive. When you choose to insert an object, Creative Writer
attempts to load it from the compact disc using a long file name. If the CD-ROM
driver does not support long file names, the file may not be found.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, obtain the most recent version of protected mode drivers
for your CD-ROM drive from your hardware manufacturer.

If you have difficulty accessing your CD-ROM drive from a Command prompt, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
