TITLE   :Using NWCONV with Duplicate Group Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Before you perform a migration, a group on a Novell NetWare server, for example
GROUP1, is a member of "print server operator." On the computer running Windows
NT, which is the migration destination, a group with a duplicate name already
exists. When you choose the "add prefix: nw" option for duplicated group names
using the Migration Tool for NetWare, after migration GROUP1 belongs to the
"print operator" group, but NWGROUP1 does not belong to the "print operator"
group.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, add the prefix "NW" (without quotation marks) to
the group on the NetWare server before you begin the migration process. For
example, if the group is named GROUP1 on both the NetWare server and the
computer running Windows NT, rename the group on the NetWare server to NWGROUP1.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.51 and
4.0.
