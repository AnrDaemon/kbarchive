SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to insert TCP/IP information using the Msbatch.inf
file for batch installations of Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft does not encourage or support changes to .inf files; therefore,
Microsoft Technical Support does not support the procedure in this article.
Although we have tested the following procedure and it appears to function as
described, make a backup copy of your .inf file before you proceed.

In the Msbatch.inf file, modify the [Network] section to include the following
line:

   Protocols=MSTCP  ; other protocols can be inserted here also

Also add the following section and parameters as needed:

   [MSTCP]
   DHCP=value ; 0=disable, 1=enable
   DNS=value ; 0=disable, 1=enable
   WINS= ; 0=disable, 1=enable, DHCP=get parameters from DHCP server.
   Gateways=ip,ip ; Lists the IP gateways (IP routers) and order to be
      used.
   IPAddress=IP
   IPMask=ip ; Sets the subnet mask if DHCP is not enabled.
   PrimaryWINS=IP
   SecondaryWINS=IP
   DNSServers=DNSIPAddress,DNSIPAddress ; Lists DNS server IP addresses
      and order to try them.
   DomainOrder=domainname,domainname ; Sets a list of DNS domains and
      order to try them.
   Hostname= ; Required when using DNSServers entry. Is usually the same
      as the computer name.
   LMHOSTPath=path ; Path and filename to LMHOSTS file.
   ScopeID=string

NOTE: Some IP settings may not be added properly. An updated file may be required
for full functionality of some of these switches.
