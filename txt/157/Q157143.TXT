SYMPTOMS
========

You receive the following error message when you start Encarta 97 in Windows
3.1x.

   Insufficient Memory

   There is not enough free memory to run Encarta 97 Encyclopedia.

NOTE: This message occurs even though your computer meets the minimum system
requirements for running the program:

To correct this situation:

1. Close any other open applications and attempt to run Encarta Encyclopedia
   again. If this dialog reappears, proceed to step 2.

2. Increase the amount of free memory by modifying the Windows virtual memory
   setting. For more information, click Help.

CAUSE
=====

This message can be caused by one of the following:

 - You may not have a Windows swapfile on your computer.
 - The current swapfile settings are too small.
 - Your swapfile is not permanent.

RESOLUTION
==========

Create a permanent swapfile of sufficient size. To create the swapfile, do the
following in Windows:

1. From Program Manager, open the Windows Control Panel, usually located in the
   Main program group.

2. Double-click the Enhanced icon.

3. In the Enhanced dialog box, click Virtual Memory. The Virtual Memory dialog
   box appears.

4. If Type under Swapfile Settings is None or Temporary, click Change.

   A New Swapfile Settings section will appear at the bottom of the dialog box.

   NOTE: If Type is Permanent, your computer already has a Permanent Swapfile.
   Click Change and skip to step 6.

5. In the New Swapfile Settings section, select Permanent from the Type
   drop-down menu.

6. In the New Size field, type the size of the new Swapfile. The Recommended
   Size (shown above the New Size field) is usually the best setting.

7. Click OK. Windows asks you if you are sure you want to make changes to the
   virtual memory settings. Click Yes. Windows confirms the creation of the
   Swapfile. Click OK. Windows prompts you to restart, click Restart Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you continue to receive an Insufficient Memory error message after you try
the steps in the "RESOLUTION" section, try some of the following troubleshooting
steps:

 - Free up more hard disk space.
 - Defragment the hard drive and set up a larger Swapfile.
 - Make sure you do not have any unnecessary programs running or loading on your
   computer.

For additional information about accomplishing these tasks in Windows, see your
Windows printed documentation or online Help.
