TITLE   :Windows NT Backup Does Not Recognize Multiple Tape Partitions
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Windows NT Backup to perform a backup or restore operation using a
tape that has been partitioned into multiple partitions, the tape cannot be
erased or formatted for use.

NOTE: Third-party software must be used to create multiple partitions on a backup
tape. Backup does not provide this functionality.

CAUSE
=====

Backup recognizes only the first partition on a tape. Other partitions on the
tape cannot be removed or formatted by Backup.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the additional partitions on the tape using the third-party program that
was originally used to create the additional partitions.

Additional query words: prodnt volumes
