TITLE   :SMS: INVWIN32 Does Not Always Detect Network Card(s)
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows NT inventory agent is sometimes unable to inventory the network
card(s).

CAUSE
=====

This problem arises when network cards are added and/or removed.

To detect the installed network cards, the Windows NT inventory agent reads the
following registry path:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\ 
   Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkCards\<NIC number>

However, the inventory agent expects to find the first NIC as NIC number "1".

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining
the Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
(without the spaces):
