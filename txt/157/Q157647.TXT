SUMMARY
=======

When you try to change the location of Information Store (IS) log files through
the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, the Administrator program
shuts down the Information Store service before changing the path. If the
Information Store service is not running, the Microsoft Exchange Server
Administrator program tries to start the service before shutting it down. This
is done to help ensure that the shutdown of the database is clean; this is a
prerequisite to moving the database.

If the service has stopped due to lack of disk space and you attempt to change
the location of IS log files through the Administrator program, the
Administrator program will return an error message stating that the service
could not be stopped. It is actually trying to start and then stop the service.
Use Performance Optimizer to move the IS log files. Microsoft has confirmed this
to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.
