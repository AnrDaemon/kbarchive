SYMPTOMS
========

If a 16-bit RPC application on Windows 95 uses SPX with the Client32 Netware
Client from Novell, it may occasionally get RPC_CALL_FAILED errors (decimal 33)
while making RPC calls to a server running on a Windows NT platform.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs on the return from the RPC call, when a large amount of data
is being transferred. The packet size is negotiated incorrectly. As a result,
when the size of the data to be transferred exceeds the underlying networks
maximum frame size, the call fails.

The frame sizes are dependent on the network architecture. For example, Ethernet
networks use a size of approximately 1500 bytes, while Token Ring networks use
4096 bytes.

RESOLUTION
==========

As a workaround, programmers must ensure that the data they transfer does not
exceed the MTU of any of the networks between the client and the server. For
example, if a client on an Ethernet talks to a server on a Token Ring network,
the data must be less than the Ethernet MTU per RPC call.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
