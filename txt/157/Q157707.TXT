TITLE   :XFOR: The IMC Does Not Dial on Weekends
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Internet Mail Connector (IMC) that is provided in Service Pack 2 for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 can be configured to use Remote Access
Service (RAS) to dial out and deliver mail. You can configure it to dial on a
daily or weekly basis. However, if you use the weekly option and also specify a
weekend schedule, the IMC will not dial on the weekends.

CAUSE
=====

The Administrator program saved incorrect values for the weekend options. It has
now been resolved.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you want the IMC to dial on the weekends, you can only configure it to use a
daily or weekly schedule without a separate weekend schedule. To configure a
daily or weekly schedule:

 - On the Dial-up Connections tab of the IMC, configure a daily or weekly
   schedule.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
