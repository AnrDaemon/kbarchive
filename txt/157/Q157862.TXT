OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdisplay kbtool kbvfp kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp500bugkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When looking at a memo field in the Debugger Watch window, extra characters that
are not a part of the memo field are displayed to the right of the Field's
value.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a table as following:

   " CREATE TABLE test1 ( fld1 M ) " (without the quotation marks)

2. Add a record to the table as following:

   " INSERT INTO test1 VALUES ( 'This is a test' ) " (without the quotation
   marks)

3. Open the Debugger window.

4. In the Watch window enter "Test1.Fld1" (without the quotation marks), to
   check the value.

5. Look to the right of the "This is a Text" string where you see that there are
   some characters that are not a part of the Memo field.

If you change the value (Add/Delete characters) in the Memo field, from Visual
FoxPro, then additional characters appear.
