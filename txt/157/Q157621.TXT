TITLE   :Personal Groups Not Visible If %Systemroot% Is Read-Only
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set the %Systemroot% directory to Read permission for specific users,
and those users are using a roaming profile that was created under Windows NT
3.51, the Personal Groups created for those users may not show up on the Windows
NT 4.0 Workstation they are using to log on to the domain.

CAUSE
=====

When the Grpconv.exe utility runs to convert the Windows NT 3.51 profile to a
Windows NT 4.0 profile, it creates temporary files in the %Systemroot% directory
using the user's account. That user only has Read permission in that directory,
so Grpconv.exe receives an Access Denied error when it tries to write the
temporary files.

RESOLUTION
==========

This behavior was changed in Grpconv.exe and it no longer tries to create the
temp files in the %Systemroot% directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
