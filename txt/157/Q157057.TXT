TITLE   :XCLN: Display Name from GAL is not Added to PAB
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0; :4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange for Windows 95, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When you add an entry from the Global Address List to the Personal Address Book
(PAB), the display name in the PAB will not be the same as the display name in
the Global Address List.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by product design. When you add an entry from the Global
Address List into the PAB, the display name in the PAB will be a combination of
the First Name field and the Last Name field. If the First Name and Last Name
fields are blank in the Global Address List entry, the PAB entry will contain
the Display Name of the Global Address List entry.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, modify the user's Last Name along with the Display
Name when you make changes to a Microsoft Exchange Global Address List object.

Another workaround is to create a display name for the Global Address List entry,
but leave the First Name and Last Name fields blank.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
