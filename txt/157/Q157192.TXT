The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Visual FoxPro 5.0 Help topic for the SYS(1037) function incorrectly states
that it activates the Page Setup dialog box.

However, the SYS(1037) function displays the Print Setup dialog box, not the Page
Setup dialog box, which provides different options to the user.

Additional query words: kbdse VFoxWin
