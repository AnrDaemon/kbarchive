TITLE   :PRB: What to Do If Syntax Coloring Is Not Working
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After installing Visual FoxPro 5.0, color highlighting of key words and comment
lines in FoxPro code may not be active.

CAUSE
=====

This may be the result of installing version 5.0 in the same directory that
Visual FoxPro 3.0 is in.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are three places where you may need to change this: the Command window,
Program windows, and Method Code windows. Use the following steps:

1. Right-click or press the Shift+F10 keys in any of the above windows and
   select Properties.

2. In the Properties window, check the box labeled "Syntax coloring."

3. In the property sheet for Program and Method windows, check a second box
   called "Apply to .prg files" or "Apply to method code" if coloring of syntax
   is desired in all program files and all Method Code windows.
