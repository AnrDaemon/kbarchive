Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 has improved routines that create and
maintain the data files. It is suggested that if this continues to be a problem,
either upgrade to version Windows NT 4.0 or disable the License Logging Service
command on the Services menu in Control Panel until an upgrade to Windows NT 4.0
is completed.
