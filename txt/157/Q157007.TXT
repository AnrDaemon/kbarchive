TITLE   :XADM: Secondary Proxy Address Replaces Target Address of CR
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a Custom Recipient (CR) and add a secondary proxy address that
is the same type (SMTP, X400, or MS) as the target address, the target address
field will be replaced by the secondary proxy address field.


CAUSE
=====

The E-Mail address and value in the proxy address list are kept in sync by a
case insensitive comparison of the proxy address to figure out whether the
E-Mail address should be updated. This is incorrect because the primary proxy
address is always in upper case and the secondary address is always lower case.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   " SERVPACK" (without the quotation marks)

Additional query words: target
