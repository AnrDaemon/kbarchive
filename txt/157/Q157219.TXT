TITLE   :INETINFO Access Violation When Using SNA Server APPC
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11,2.11 SP1; winnt:2.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbprogramming

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 2.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) version 2.0 and use the
HTTPODBC DLL to query a DB2 database using the StarQuest ODBC/DRDA driver
included with the Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 Windows NT client software, the
StarQuest ODBC driver uses an APPC session to communicate with a host or AS/400
DB2 database.

Whenever a SQL error is encountered by the ODBC driver, or even after a
successful query response, the following access violation occurs:

   App: exe\inetinfo.dbg <process id>
   When: <date and time>
   Exception number: c0000005 (access violation)

The Drwtsn32.log shows all the threads of the process; however, the log does not
indicate the thread that encountered the "FAULT."

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when Wappc32.dll is unloaded while one of the Snadmod.dll
threads is executing the APPC routing procedure. The following stack trace of
the failure is observed, indicating that the Snadmod.dll attempted to invoke a
function that is no longer in memory:
