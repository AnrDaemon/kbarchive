-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

CPIC reports CM_PRODUCT_SPECIFIC_ERROR (20) when you try to issue an MC_ALLOCATE
after you issue a RECEIVE_ALLOCATE and receive a TP_ID. An APPC trace will
reveal a primary and secondary error codes indicating that the TP_ID is
incorrect. The following event will be registered in the Application Log:

   Event 3028: Error returned from APPC that does not map to CPI-C error,
   00000100

CAUSE
=====

The CPIC library was not handling APPC TP_IDs correctly if an application issues
a Receive, cmrcv(), and then issues an Allocate, cmallc().
