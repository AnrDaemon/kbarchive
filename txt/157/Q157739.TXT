TITLE   :Winbm2fv.exe Does Not Work in Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use the Windows Bookmarks to Favorites utility
(Winbm2fv.exe) inside Windows NT 4.0 to convert Netscape Navigator bookmarks to
Internet Explorer Favorites, the conversion program returns the following
message and fails:

   Internet Explorer Not Found

CAUSE
=====

The WINBM2FV utility is provided on the Microsoft BBS and ftp site, and does not
come with a readme file. The utility was designed to run with Windows 95. When
run from within Windows NT, the utility is unable to locate the Favorites folder
in the Winnt\Profiles\<USER> directory; therefore, it fails. There is no
browse capability in the utility to locate the Favorites folder.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, perform one of the following steps:

 - Use Internet Explorer 3.0 to open the Bookmark.htm file created in Netscape
   Navigator, which contains the Navigator bookmarks. In Internet Explorer, on
   the Favorites menu, click Add to Favorites. This will make all of the
   Navigator bookmarks easily accessible on one HTM page.

   -or-

 - Manually add the bookmarks to the favorites list.
