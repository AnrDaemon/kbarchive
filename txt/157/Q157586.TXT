TITLE   :Corporate Evaluation CD Fails Installing WinNT 4.0 Workstation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Some versions of the Corporate Evaluation 97 CD-ROM have two folders that are
named incorrectly. The Winntw folder should be I386 and the I386\Drvlib_N folder
should be I386\Drvlib.nic.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Copy the entire Winntw folder and all subfolders to a share or onto a hard
   disk drive.

2. Change the folder name Winntw to I386.

3. Change the folder name Winntw\Drvlib_N to I386\Drvlib.nic.

The setup should proceed as normal as it is now the same as the standard Windows
NT 4.0 Workstation compact disc.

If you use Windows 95, you need to run WINNT from the I386 folder. If you run
Windows NT 3.5x, you need to run WINNT32 from the I386 folder. The installation
will proceed the same as a normal setup from the Full Windows NT Workstation 4.0
compact disc.

Customers can get an upgraded Corporate 97 compact disc if they cannot or will
not implement the above workaround. This has been rectified and a replacement
compact disc can be sent to the customer if he or she calls the following
hotline (800) 360-7561 and asks for part number 098-66815.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows NT 4.0 installation has a 120-day time limit on it so you should not
install this on production machines or upgrade a full Windows NT 3.x setup.
