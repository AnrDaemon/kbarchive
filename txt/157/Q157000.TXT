TITLE   :XFOR: Korean UUENCODED Attachments Corrupted
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Outgoing messages with UUENCODED attachments from the Microsoft Exchange
Internet Mail Connector (IMC) in the Korean language might have corrupt
attachments, and the receiving SMTP host might not be able to uudecode the
attachments correctly. This can occur if a message is sent with an attachment
with a Korean file name, or a message with a Korean body followed by an
attachment with a Korean file name.

CAUSE
=====

In the first case, the X-MS-Attachment header line has the Korean Escape
sequence, which adds a carriage-return line-feed (CRLF) sequence that corrupts
the header. It will look like this:

   X-MS-Attachment: $)C
   E8@O.bmp 0 00-00-1980 00:00

In addition, the Begin line of the UUENCODEd data is incorrect. It will look like
this:

   begin 600 $)C
   E8@O.bmp
   M0DU"`@```````$(````H````( ```" ````!``0````````"```3"P``$PL`

In the second message example, a Korean body with an attachment that has a Korean
file name, you will see the same issues as with the first message, and also an
Escape sequence in the message body. It will look like this:

                        $)C
   0!3*4Y

   begin 600 $)C
   E8@O.bmp
   M0DU"`@```````$(````H````( ```" ````!``0````````"```3"P``$PL`

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
