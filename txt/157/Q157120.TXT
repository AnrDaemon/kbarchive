SYMPTOMS
========

If you first select and then right-click on a text box you get one of two
shortcut menus. This problem does not occur if the text box is not selected
before you right-click. For example, if you right-click on the edge of the text
box, the shortcut menu displays the following commands:

   Cut
   Copy
   Paste
   Edit Text
   Grouping
   Order
   Create Text Box link
   Set AutoShape Defaults
   Format Text Box

If you right-click in the center of the text box, the shortcut menu displays
these commands:

   Cut
   Copy
   Paste
   Borders and shading
   Format Frame

WORKAROUND
==========

To select the shortcut menu to format the text box, select the text box and then
right-click the border of the text box.

To select the shortcut menu for the text that you typed inside the text box,
click once inside the text box and then right-click the text you want to format
in the text box. The shortcut menu displays the following commands. (Note that
some of the commands listed below may be unavailable if text is not selected
inside the text box.)
