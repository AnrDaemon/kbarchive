OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbvfp300 kbvfp300b kbvfp500 kbvfp600 kbMDAC250

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to create an ODBC datasource using the Visigenic Oracle ODBC driver
may result in the following error message:

   The dynamic-link library Orant71.dll could not be found in the specified path
   <current path>.

This is followed by the following message:

   The Oracle(tm) client and networking components were not found. These
   components are supplied by Oracle corporation and are installed when you
   install the Oracle client software.

NOTE: As of 12/9/98, Visigenic has been acquired by INPRISE, Inc.

CAUSE
=====

The file Orant71.dll ships with the Oracle client software (SQL*Net) and is not
provided with Visual FoxPro or any other Microsoft product. Unlike many other
ODBC drivers, an Oracle ODBC driver requires additional software in order to
communicate with an Oracle server.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install the Oracle client software before creating the ODBC datasource.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Oracle client software (SQL*Net) is manufactured by Oracle Corporation, a
vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
