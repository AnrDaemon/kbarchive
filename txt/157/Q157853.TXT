TITLE   :FIX: Upsizing Wizard Generated SQL Code Causes Errors
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:5.0 5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbvfp kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp500bugkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running the SQL code that is generated from either the Oracle or SQL Server
Upsizing Wizards, an error occurs.

CAUSE
=====

Some of the comment blocks in the generated SQL code are marked incorrectly.

NOTE: Other errors may occur that are unrelated to this problem.

WORKAROUND
==========

In the SQL language, a multi-line comment is opened with "/*" and closed with
"*/". Some of the comment blocks in the generated SQL code are opened with "*/".
To avoid these errors, change the open comment designators to "/*".

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open the Testdata database located in the \Vfp\Samples\Data directory.

2. Start the SQL Server Upsizing Wizard.

3. Click the Next button.

4. Specify a valid SQL Server datasource.

5. Select the customer table from the list of available tables.

6. Click the Finish button.

7. Click "Save generated SQL." Then click the Finish button.

8. Drill-down through the data tree until you've located the sql_uw table.

9. Browse the sql_uw table, and look at the code in the scriptsql memo field.

NOTE: the comment section for "Index code" is opened with "*/".
