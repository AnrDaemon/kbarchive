SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to install printers using the Msbatch.inf file for
batch installations of Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft does not encourage or support changes to .inf files; therefore,
Microsoft Technical Support does not support the procedure in this article.
Although we have tested the following procedure and it appears to function as
described, make a backup copy of your .inf file before you proceed.

In the Msbatch.inf file, modify the [printers] section to select printers to be
installed during Setup. The following sections illustrate various printer
selections.

No Printer
----------

If you do not want to install a printer, make sure the [printers] section exists
but contains no entries.

Local Printers
--------------

MyPrinter=HP LaserJet IIIsi,LPT1

This entry specifies the friendly name of the printer (MyPrinter), the name of
the printer from the Msprint.inf file (HP LaserJet IIISi), and the port to which
it is connected.

Network Printers
----------------

Networkprinter=HP LaserJet IIIsi,\\<printserver>\<printer>

This entry specifies the friendly name (Networkprinter), the name of the printer
from the Msprint.inf file (HP LaserJet IIISi), and the server and share name for
the print queue.
