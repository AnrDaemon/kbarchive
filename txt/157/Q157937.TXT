======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A computer running Windows NT Workstation or Server that recently joined a
domain may not be able to add domain user or group accounts to its local groups.
When User Manager is used on this recent installation, and the name is typed in
the Add Names text box instead of selecting it by double- clicking the name from
the list, you may receive the following error:

   The account DomainName\UserName could not be found.

This error may be most apparent when using scripts to automate the installation
of Windows NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After a computer running Windows NT Server or Workstation joins a domain, the
user is asked to restart the computer. If the machine is not restarted, the
Netlogon service is not started and the above error can occur.

Instead of typing the user name in the Add Names text box, double-click the name
from the Names list box, which allows the name to be added without the use of
the Netlogon service.
