TITLE   :SMS: Hardware Inventory Changes Lotus Organizer Sound Output
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbhw kbsound kbInventory smsinv kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After the Systems Management Server Inventory Agent runs on an IBM ThinkPad 700
Series that has Lotus Organizer installed, the Lotus Organizer sound output will
be changed. The sound names remain the same, but the sound quality will be
softer. This behavior is not seen with .wav files.

CAUSE
=====

The Inventory Agent executable file Getcomp.exe affects how the Lotus Organizer
stores the sound files.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: poor quality lower reduced volume
