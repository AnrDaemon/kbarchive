-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0b 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your slide contains text using the Palatino font, and you print it to a
PostScript printer from a computer running Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0, the
text is printed with incorrect character spacing. Specifically, letters are
printed too close together and wide letters and symbols (such as W, /, m, and so
forth) overlap each other. This effect is most noticeable in text that uses
Palatino, though it also occurs in text that uses Palatino Bold, Palatino
Italic, and Palatino Bold Italic.

If your version of PowerPoint runs under Windows 3.1 or 3.11 and you print the
same slide, the text prints correctly.

The same text prints correctly from Microsoft Word for Windows and Word for
Windows 95.

WORKAROUND
==========

PowerPoint ships with a TrueType font called Book Antiqua. This TrueType font is
virtually identical to Palatino. Substitute Book Antiqua for Palatino.
