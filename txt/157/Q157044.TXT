SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows NT allows users to monitor CPU usage through Task Manager and
Performance Monitor. If these tools are used in Windows NT 4.0, some
applications may appear to be consuming 100 percent of the CPU time, while
Windows NT is waiting for other actions to occur.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT 4.0 allows an application to consume all of the CPU time if no other
thread is waiting for CPU time. As soon as another thread requests CPU time,
regardless of the priority of that thread, Windows NT 4.0 yields control and CPU
time will drop back to normal levels.

The behavior described above is the result of a change made to the way in which
Windows NT 4.0 manages CPU time. This behavior is by design and has no negative
effect on Windows NT 4.0 or application performance.
