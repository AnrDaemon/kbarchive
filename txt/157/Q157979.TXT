DOCUMENT:Q157979  10-AUG-2001  [winnt]
TITLE   :NT/RDR: "Access Denied" with Windows NT 4.0 Ntbackup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT 4.0 Ntbackup displays an "access denied" error if you try to access
directories under a remote share to which you have connected. Therefore, you are
not able to back up any remote files or directories.

WORKAROUND
==========

Give the Backup Operator group or user the appropriate NTFS rights (Read) on all
files and subdirectories. However, this implies that the Backup Operator group
or user will be able to read files and directories from Windows Explorer also.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.

A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression- tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
