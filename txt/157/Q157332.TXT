TITLE   :Windows NT Hangs with Adaptec 2940 Enable Disconnect Set to No
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start your computer, Windows NT 4.0 may stop responding (hang) at the
blue startup screen displaying the system processor and memory configuration.
When this occurs, no dots appear on the screen, and you receive no error
message. In addition, if you attempt to install Windows NT 4.0 from the 3 floppy
diskettes your system may hang on disk 3 while displaying "loading SCSI floppy
driver".

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Enable Disconnect setting is set to No in the
SCSI configuration for the Adaptec 2940 SCSI controller in your computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set the Adaptec SCSI controller back to the default settings. To do so, follow
these steps:

1. Restart your computer. When the BIOS message for the Adaptec SCSI controller
   appears on the screen, press CTRL+A to enter the SCSI controller
   configuration tool.

2. Select SCSI Configuration from the menu.

3. Press F6 to load the default settings.

4. If the boot drive is not SCSI ID 0, go to the SCSI Boot Configuration menu
   under Additional Options and set the ID to match the drive that is the boot
   drive.

5. Restart the computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Adaptec documentation recommends setting the Enable Disconnect setting to No
if there is only one drive on the bus to improve performance. The Aic78xx.sys
driver requires this setting to be set to Yes.
