PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenvkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run CMD or BAT files that use the Windows NT command extension syntax,
access violations in Cmd.exe may occur.

For example, create the following Test.cmd file:

   FOR /R C:\ %%f in (iexplore.exe, patchdll.dll, srv.sys) do if exist %%f
   echo %%f

An error message will be displayed:

   Application Error: The instruction at "0x77f646ce" referenced memory at
   "0x0073006f". The memory could not be read.

NOTE: The address values may be different on your system.

Results may vary, depending on what group of files is contained in the set. A Dr.
Watson error may be one such occurrence. Usually, there is no error if the set
contains only a single file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
