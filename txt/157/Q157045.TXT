SUMMARY
=======

In Visual FoxPro 5.0 and 6.0 for Windows, several read-only controls take on the
DisabledBackColor property. The ListBox and ComboBox controls display that color
at all times, while the TextBox control displays the DisabledBackColor when
focus is moved to it. Regardless of the settings of the DisabledBackColor and
ReadOnly properties, a TextBox control within a column of a Grid does not assume
the DisabledBackColor. An EditBox displays the DisabledBackColor unless the
EditBox also has a BackStyle property of Transparent, in which case it shows the
colors of the Windows Display 3D Object setting of Windows Control Panel.

This behavior is in contrast to the colors displayed in Visual FoxPro for Windows
3.0 and 3.0b, where the colors of the controls are not affected by the settings
of the ReadOnly property.

This change is in accord with the standards established with Windows 95.
