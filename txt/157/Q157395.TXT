TITLE   :WD97: Tabs or Spaces Missing Using Continuous Section Break
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kblayout

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you center a selection that contains leading and trailing tabs (or spaces)
followed by a continuous section break, the leading tabs (or spaces) are
removed, but the trailing tabs (or spaces) are retained.

For example, when you center the following selection:

-->A--><Enter><Continuous Section Break>

the result is this:

A--><Enter><Continuous Section Break>

If you center a selection that contains leading and ending tabs (or spaces)
followed by a continuous section break and another line that contains leading
and ending tabs, the leading tab is removed from the first line but not the
second line, and the ending tab is removed from the second line but not the
first line.

For example, when you center the following selection:

-->A--><Enter><Continuous Section Break>
-->B--><Enter>

the result is this:

A--><Enter><Continuous Section Break>
-->B<Enter>

The drawback to this is that your text will be off-center.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Remove the tabs either before or after you center the text.

   -or-

 - Remove the section break before you center the text; all of the tabs will be
   removed.

STATUS
======
