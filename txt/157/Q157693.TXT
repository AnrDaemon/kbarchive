TITLE   :XFOR: IMC Might Lose Messages if Code Pages are not Installed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Inbound messages might be accepted by the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail
Connector (IMC), and recorded in the protocol log, and yet not successfully
submitted to the Microsoft Exchange Information Store (IS). In this case, you
will not find any mention of the inbound messages in the message tracking log,
assuming you have message tracking turned on, or the saved in the
exchsrvr\imcdata\in\archive directory.

CAUSE
=====

An incoming MIME message might contain embedded messages using character sets
that are not supported or correctly configured on the IMC server. This only
happens under certain timing conditions. The message fails to convert due to the
unsupported character sets, and the IMC performs an extra release of the message
to the IS. The IS will then error on every subsequent attempt made by the IMC to
submit messages to the IS, and the IMC will handle the failure by simply
deleting the message.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
