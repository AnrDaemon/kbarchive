The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You have a system with more than one CPU and Services for Macintosh installed.
Under stress, the server intermittently stops with the following error:

NOTE: This problem has been observed while using a SysKonnect FDDI adapter, but
it may occur with other NDIS drivers as well.


CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused because you are using a network interface card (NIC)
driver that is written as a "full NDIS driver" to gain maximum performance,
which causes synchronization problems in Sfmsrv.sys, a component of Services for
Macintosh.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
