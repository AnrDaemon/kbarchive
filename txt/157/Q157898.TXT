SUMMARY
=======

The Setup Wizard for Visual Basic 4.0 allows commas within filenames that are
distributed with Visual Basic program files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the release of Windows NT 3.1, special characters in filenames, as well as
long filenames, were allowed. This broke the restrictive 8.3 character file name
rule that limited MS-DOS filenames, and allowed for more descriptive and useful
filenames. In particular, the comma could now be used in a filename such as an
alphanumeric character.

Realizing this, the Setup Wizard for Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 now allows the
use of commas within filenames. If you add a file manually whose filename
contains a comma to the list of targeted distribution files, the Setup Wizard
will put quotes around the added file in order to signify that a comma was used
within the filename. You should be aware of this if you intend to edit the
SETUP.LST file manually after the Setup Wizard initially generates it.

Example
-------

In the following sample Files section of SETUP.LST, File1 is an example of a
normal filename, while File2 is an example of a filename with a comma used. Note
that the comma is used as the delimiter for each entry. To solve this potential
conflict, the Setup Wizard placed double-quotes (" ") around the filenames in
question:

      >> [Files]
      >>

      File1=1,,Calc.EX_,Calc.EXE,$(AppPath),$(EXESelfRegister),,6/5/1995,14336
      ,1.0.0.0

      >> File2=1,,"my,test.tx_","my,test.txt",$(AppPath),,,6/5/1995,20

NOTE: This functionality is only available with the [Files] Section of SETUP.LST.
Files that make use of commas in their filenames cannot be placed within the
[BootStrap] Section of SETUP.LST. The [BootStrap] Section should only contain
Visual Basic 4.0 runtime-required files and none of these files have commas in
their filenames. The only way this situation can occur is if SETUP.LST is edited
manually after its initial creation. This should be a rare occurrence and it is
not suggested.
