TITLE   :WD97: Can't Save Version for Read-Only Document
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word8 word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to save a version of a read-only document, the following error
message appears:

   This file is read-only.
   filename

CAUSE
=====

This functionality is by design. When you open a document that was saved with
the Read-only recommended option selected, the following message appears:

   <filename> should be opened as read-only unless changes to it need to
   be saved. Open as read-only?

If you click Yes, the document is opened as read-only. Changes you make to this
file cannot be saved back to the original file.

If you click No, the document is opened normally. Changes you make to this file
can be saved back to the original file.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you want to make changes to a read-only document (for example, you want to
save a version of the file), do not open it as read-only. Instead, when Word
asks you how to open the file with the message listed in the "Cause" section of
this article, click No. Word will open the file as a normal Word document. Then
you can save a version of the document, make changes to it, and save the current
version of the file.

Additional query words: versioning
