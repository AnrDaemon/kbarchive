SYMPTOMS
========

After a fresh installation of RRAS on a Windows NT 4.0-based computer, the first
route that is added by using Routemon.exe is not retained after a start/stop of
the Router service. Although it is possible to re-add the same route, it may
never survive a restart of the Router service.
