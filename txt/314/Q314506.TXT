SUMMARY
=======

You can use Microsoft Internet Explorer to determine the security settings of
your Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 configuration. You can also check
the server agent, ISAPI DLL, to verify that you have configured the agent
correctly. This article summarizes the necessary steps to ensure that your
servers are properly secured.

NOTE: In addition to IIS, you need some familiarity with Microsoft SQL Server
2000 CE to perform the procedures in this article.

Check the Server Agent, ISAPI DLL
---------------------------------

You can use Internet Explorer to verify that your server agent, ISAPI DLL, is
configured properly. To do this, type the following in the Address bar in
Internet Explorer, and then press ENTER:

   http://<my server>/sqlce/sscesa10.dll

NOTE: If you configured IIS to use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), change http:// to
"https://" (without the quotation marks).

If you configured your server agent properly, the string "Body" will be
displayed.

Verify IIS Security Settings
----------------------------

You can verify that your IIS security settings are correct while you check ISAPI
DLL. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Type the following in the Address bar of Internet Explorer, and then press
   ENTER:

   http://<my server>/

   NOTE: If you configured IIS to use SSL, change the http:// to "https://"
   (without the quotation marks).

2. If you configured IIS for Basic authentication, you will be prompted for your
   user name and password.

   If you are not prompted for a name and password, you have configured your IIS
   for anonymous access without any authentication.

   NOTE: Be sure to click Refresh on the Internet Explorer toolbar after you make
   changes to your server. This ensures that Internet Explorer does not read
   from the cache.
