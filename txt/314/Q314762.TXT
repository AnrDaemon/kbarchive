KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network Version 7.0 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows XP 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you previously used MSN Explorer with a dial-up service and you are now
trying to install a DSL connection, you may be unable to complete the setup of
CPE. After several minutes of "Checking DSL Modem", you may be given a choice to
"Cancel" or "Retry". If you choose to "Retry", you will experience a repeating
loop.

CAUSE
=====

The code used in the installation program is interacting with wininet, the
object that controls the Online/Offline status in Windows XP.

RESOLUTION
==========

This issue will be resolved in the next release of the installation CD. Until
that time, please use the following steps during installation.

To install MSN Broadband
------------------------

1. Launch the MSN Broadband setup as detailed in the Welcome Kit.

2. When the status changes to Checking DSL Modem, launch Internet Explorer.
   Note: Do not launch MSN Explorer at this time.

3. When prompted to Connect or Stay Offline, choose Connect. When Internet
   Explorer launches, minimize it.

4. Continue with Setup.
