TITLE   :FIX: Object Referenced by Property with ASSIGN Cannot Be Closed
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCOMt kbOOP kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbvfp700fix kbvfp700

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A form or other class is created with a custom property which has an associated
ASSIGN method. When the class is instantiated, and a reference to another object
is assigned to the custom property, you are unable to release the second object,
even if the first object no longer exists.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q316964 How to Obtain the Latest Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0 Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Copy the following code to a new program and run it in Visual FoxPro 7.0:

   LOCAL loMyForm AS FORM, ;
       loCustClass AS CUSTOM

   loCustClass = CREATEOBJECT("MyCustom")
   loMyForm = CREATEOBJECT("FORM")
   loCustClass.ofrm = loMyForm
   loMyForm.SHOW(1)

   DEFINE CLASS MyCustom AS CUSTOM
   	ofrm = .NULL.

   	PROCEDURE ofrm_assign
   		LPARAMETERS vNewVal
   		THIS.ofrm = m.vNewVal
   	ENDPROC
   ENDDEFINE

2. When the form appears, try to close it by using the Close button; you are
   unable to do so. The only way to close the form is to issue a CLEAR ALL
   command from the Command Window.

NOTE: This problem only occurs if there is an ASSIGN method on the property
holding the object reference ("ofrm_assign" in the example code).
