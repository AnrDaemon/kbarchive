SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to set up File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

are not listed.

   group that is used for FTP access.

    - Read Permissions

7. Click OK.

8. Click Add to add another rule.

9. Select the account that you selected in step 4.

10. In the Apply Onto list, click to select This Folder only.

   permissions are not listed):
