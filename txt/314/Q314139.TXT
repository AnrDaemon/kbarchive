KEYWORDS:kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 Professional Edition 
 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use the mouse as a flight yoke while you play Microsoft
Flight Simulator 2002, you are unable to do so. The aircraft does not respond to
mouse movements during the game.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the mouse is not supported as a flight yoke in this
version of Microsoft Flight Simulator.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use keyboard commands to fly the aircraft, or install a
supported game controller.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Earlier versions of Microsoft Flight Simulator supported the use of a mouse as
the flight yoke during the game. In Flight Simulator 2002, you can use a game
controller or keyboard commands to control the flight of the aircraft.
