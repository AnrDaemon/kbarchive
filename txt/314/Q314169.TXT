TITLE   :SMS: "Connection Failed" Error Message w/Administrator Console
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork kbtool kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Systems Management Server (SMS) version 2.0 administrator
console from a Microsoft Windows 2000-based computer, you may receive a
"Connection Failed" error message instead of being connected to the SMS site
server. However, Microsoft Windows NT 4.0-based computers that are running the
console can connect without errors.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if there is a user account in the domain that has the same
name as the SMS site server or the remote SQL Server that hosts the SMS
Provider.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, completely delete the matching user account. Note
that the console cannot connect even if you disable the account, and it is not
possible to rename the SMS site server without having to reinstall SMS.
