   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After you restore an Exchange Server 5.5 computer, the Event service may not
start on the Exchange Server 5.5 computer, and then the following event ID
message may be logged in the Microsoft Windows NT Application event log:

   Event ID: 5
   Source: MSExchangeES
   Type: Error
   Category: General
   Description: An unexpected MAPI error occurred. Error returned was
   [0x80004005].

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you use an incorrect organization or site name when you
restore an Exchange Server 5.5 computer. The following registry key entries
contain an incorrect organization or site:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeSA\
   Parameters\Enterprise

   -or-

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeSA\
   Parameters\Site

NOTE: The above registry keys are one path; they have been wrapped for
readability.

This issue can also occur if you restore an Exchange Server 5.5 computer and you
use an incorrect organization or site, and then instead of performing a
reinstallation of the server, you correct only the following registry key
entry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA\
   Parameters\X500DN

All of the Exchange services restart except the Event service (MSExchangeES), and
the event ID message in the "Symptoms" section of this article is logged.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this issue, change the registry entries to correspond to the correct
organization and site names specified in the Exchange Server 5.5 directory, and
then restart the Event service:

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Administrator program.

2. Right-click the Organization and Site containers, and then note the directory
   names.

3. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

4. Locate the appropriate values in the following registry keys:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeSA\
   Parameters\Enterprise

NOTE: This registry key must correspond to the organization directory name that
you retrieved in the Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Administrator program in step
2.

   -and-

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeSA\
   Parameters\Site

NOTE: This registry key must correspond to the site directory name retrieved in
the Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Administrator program in step 2.

5. On the Edit menu, click String, modify the value to correspond to the correct
   organization (Enterprise) or site name, and then click OK.

6. Quit Registry Editor.

NOTE: The Exchange Server organization, server and site names are case sensitive.
Make sure that you type the correct name and case for each value.
