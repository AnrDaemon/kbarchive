 - ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), versions 2.1, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You receive an access violation in ADO under the following circumstances:

1. Call the Debug.Print method on certain properties of the ADO Recordset
   object.

2. Compile the project.

3. Run the file as an executable (.exe) file.

CAUSE

This problem occurs because the compiler does not remove the Debug.Print
statement correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use one of the following methods:

 - Remove the Debug.Print statement from the code.

 - Store the property value in a variable.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic.

2. Add two CommandButton controls to the form. Specify the caption "Open
   Recordset" for Command1. Specify the caption "Close Application" for
   Command2.

3. On the Project menu, click Reference, and then select the "Microsoft ActiveX
   Data Object 2.x" check box.

4. Add the following code to the form:

   Option Explicit
   Dim cn As ADODB.Connection

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
       Dim rs As ADODB.Recordset
       Set rs = New ADODB.Recordset
       
       rs.Open "Select * from Customers", cn, adOpenDynamic, adLockBatchOptimistic
       
       Debug.Print "Update: " & rs.EOF
       
       rs.Close
       Set rs = Nothing
       
   End Sub

   Private Sub Command2_Click()
       Unload Me
   End Sub

   Private Sub Form_Load()
       Set cn = New ADODB.Connection
       cn.Open "User ID=sa;password=sa;Initial Catalog=pubs;Data Source=mySQLServer"
   End Sub

5. Modify the connection string as appropriate for your environment.

6. Compile and run the executable file.

7. Click Open Recordset.

8. Click Close Application. Notice that an access violation occurs.

9. To resolve this problem, use one of the following methods:

    - Comment out the Debug.Print line of code, and then repeat steps 5 through
      7.

    - Replace the code

       Debug.Print "Update: " & rs.EOF

      with the following code:

   Dim b as boolean
   b = rs.eof
   Debug.Print "Update: " & b
