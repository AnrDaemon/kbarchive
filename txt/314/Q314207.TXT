TITLE   :SMS: Site System Status Summarizer Does Not Update Properly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool kbsms200 kbsms200bug smsinst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view the site status node of the Systems Management Server (SMS)
administrator's console, the "Summary Date" site system status for a site may
not be current, and it may not update.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the schedule for the site's site system status
summarizer has been changed from the default start time of 12:00 AM. If the site
system status summarizer start time is changed to anything other than a whole
hour value (for example, 12:30AM rather than 12:00AM), the site system status is
not updated.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do not change the site system status summarizer
start time to a value other than a whole hour setting such as 12:00, 1:00, 2:00,
3:00, and so on.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can change the schedule for the site system status summarizer in the SMS
administrator console by opening the following node:

   Site Database\Site Hierarchy\Sitecode-SiteName\Site Settings\Status
   Summarizers\Site System Status Summarizer
