Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code from a program (.prg) file:

   LOCAL aobj[1]
   LOCAL xx As Form
   DELETE FILE testxx.sc?
   CREATE FORM testxx NOWAIT
   =ASELOBJ(aobj,1)
   xx = aobj[1]
   xx.AutoCenter = .t.
   xx.WriteMethod('click1',[WAIT WINDOW PROGRAM() time 1],.t.)

   KEYBOARD 'Y' CLEAR
   RELEASE WINDOW 'Form Designer'

   DO FORM testxx 
   testxx.click1
   testxx.Release 

   MODIFY FORM testxx NOWAIT 
   =ASELOBJ(aobj,1) 
   xx = aobj[1]
   * Uncomment the next line to set up conditions for a possible fatal error.
   * xx.ResetToDefault('click1')
   RETURN

2. In the Properties window, click the Methods tab. Find the Click1 method,
   right-click it, and select Reset to Default. The method will be removed from
   the form instead of being reset.

   If you uncomment the last line of the code above, you will see a stray entry
   in the Properties window, where the Click1 method should have been. If you
   double-click that entry, you receive the following error:

   Fatal error: Exception code=C0000005
