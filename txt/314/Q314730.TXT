TITLE   :Access Violation in SNMP Running GETNEXT Queries Against OSPF
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbWinNT400nospFix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run multiple GETNEXT queries against the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
agent, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) may intermittently generate
access violations with error message 0xc0000005. The following sample query may
cause the error message:

   snmputil getnext <computername> public .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.23.1.2.1.1.6
   .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.23.1.2.1.1.7 .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.23.1.2.1.1.3
   .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.23.1.2.1.1.4

This command was looped in a batch file to run 1,000 times to cause the problem
to occur.

CAUSE
=====

When Windows compares the OID string against the OID IpBaseRtEntry value, the
buffer is overrun if the buffer entry that contains the original OID also
contains a number that matches the IpBaseRtEntry value. If the buffer is at the
end of a page and the next page is not initialized, an access violation occurs.
