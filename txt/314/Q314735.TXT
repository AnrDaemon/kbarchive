PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:KbClientServer kbDatabase kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbCodeSnippet kbvfp700 _IK283

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 7.0, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a computer that is running Windows 95, you use the Visual FoxPro (VFP) OLEDB
Provider to create an ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) recordset based on a VFP table.
When you reference one of the fields in the table, one of two problems may
occur:

 - If you reference the field name by the fields collection index number (for
   instance, "RS.Fields(0).Name"), garbled output appears.

 - If you reference the field name directly by specifying the field name (for
   instance, "Fields("f1").Name"), the following errors may occur:

   Microsoft Visual Basic error message

   Item can not be found in the collection corresponding to the requested name
   or ordinal.

   Visual FoxPro error message

   Member FIELDS does not evaluate to an object.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q316964 How to Obtain the Latest Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the VFP OLEDB Provider installed
with Visual FoxPro 7.0. This problem was first corrected in Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0 Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Use Visual FoxPro 7.0 to build the following code into a new executable
   (.EXE) file:

   #DEFINE adUseClient             3
   #DEFINE adOpenStatic            3
   #DEFINE adLockBatchOptimistic   4

   CD JUSTPATH(SYS(16))
   ERASE TestDBF.*
   CREATE TABLE TestDBF (F1 c(5))
   INSERT INTO TestDBF VALUES ("HELLO")
   USE IN SELECT("TestDBF")

   LOCAL loRS AS ADODB.RecordSet, ;
   	loConn AS ADODB.CONNECTION

   loConn = CREATEOBJECT("ADODB.Connection")
   loRS = CREATEOBJECT("ADODB.RecordSet")

   loConn.CursorLocation = adUseClient
   loConn.OPEN("Provider=vfpoledb;Data Source=" + JUSTPATH(SYS(16)))

   loRS.OPEN("SELECT * FROM TestDBF", loConn, adOpenStatic, adLockBatchOptimistic)
   WITH loRS
   	MESSAGEBOX("Fieldname should be f1.  It is " + .FIELDS(0).NAME)
   	MESSAGEBOX("Fieldname should be f1.  It is " + .FIELDS("F1").NAME)
   ENDWITH

   loRS.CLOSE
   loConn.CLOSE

   RELEASE ALL

NOTE: This sample code requires ADO, which does not ship with Windows 95 but is
included with the Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) package. You can
obtain the latest version of MDAC from the following Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/data/download.htm
   (http://www.microsoft.com/data/download.htm)

2. Install the executable and the pre-SP1 release version of the Visual FoxPro
   OLEDB Provider on a Windows 95 computer.

3. Run the EXE to see the error messages.
