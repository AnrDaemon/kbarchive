Microsoft scanned this file for viruses. Microsoft used the most current
virus-detection software that was available on the date that the file was
posted. The file is stored on secure servers that prevent any unauthorized
changes to the file.


Page 24: Error In Code Sample
-----------------------------

There is an error in the code sample on page 24, step 12. Change:

   void SetName(String *Name)
     { strName->Copy(Name);};
   String* GetName() { return strName; };

To:

   void SetName(String *Name)
     { strName = strName->Copy(Name);};
   String* GetName() { return strName; };


Page 28: Incorrect Output In Screenshot
---------------------------------------

The screenshot on page 28 is missing information. If the build is successful, the
results will not be what is shown:

   Animal 1
   Name:
   Legs: 4

   Animal 2
   Name:
   Legs: 4

But rather:

   Animal 1
   Name: Cat
   Legs: 4

   Animal 2
   Name: Dog
   Legs: 4


Page 35: Y Should Be Lowercase
------------------------------

On page 35, in the section titled References, the letter Y in the third line of
code should be lower case.

Change:

   Y = 4;		//  Changes the value of x to 4.

To:

   y = 4;		//  Changes the value of x to 4.


Page 326: Error In Step 4
-------------------------

There is an error in the second paragraph of text in step 4.

Change:
"the point size (25 points),"

To:
"the point size (16 points),"


Page 327: Floppy.Bmp Missing From CD-ROM
----------------------------------------

The file file "Floppy.bmp" used in the code sample on page 327 is not included on
the CD-ROM. For the purposes of this exercise, you may use the Save.bmp file
found on the CD-ROM.

Note that the project will not match the screenshots in the book.
