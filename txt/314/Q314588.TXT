TITLE   :XADM: Err Msg Running Backup Against a Clustered Exchange Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to perform an Exchange Server-aware backup against a clustered
Exchange Server installation (one with two or more network interfaces), the
backup software package may fail to communicate with the Exchange Server
installation, and you may subsequently receive any of the following error
messages:

   RPC_S_SERVER_UNAVAILABLE

   -or-

   0x6ba

   -or-

   1722

CAUSE
=====

Although you can specify and create additional IP address resources within the
Cluster Administrator, Exchange Server binds only to a single IP address
resource. As a result, Exchange Server does not register its remote procedure
call (RPC) endpoints for these additional IP address resources and/or
interfaces. Therefore, you may receive an error message when you attempt to
perform Exchange Server operations against these additional network interfaces.
