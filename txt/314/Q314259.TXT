-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3, 5.5 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) profile in a
MAPI client (such as Microsoft Outlook) to try to delete multiple mail items,
the client may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if Performance Optimizer (Perfwiz.exe) was not run after an
Exchange Server service pack was installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, run Performance Optimizer (Perfwiz.exe) to reconfigure
the Exchange Server computer.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, stop and restart the MAPI client; after you do so,
you can work with the client as usual. However, if you try to delete multiple
messages again or try to empty the trash can, the client hangs again.
