TITLE   :PRB:Slow Clients Disconnected When Large Synchronous Writes Used
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Web clients who are using slow connections may be disconnected.

CAUSE
=====

The Web server is using large synchronous write methods to send data.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Increase the connection timeout value in the Web site properties on the
   server.

 - Use asynchronous I/O (note that this is only possible with an ISAPI filter or
   extension).

 - Call the various write methods with a small amount of data in a loop, and
   keep looping until all of the data is sent.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Active Server Pages (ASP) pages, this may occur when you call Response.Write
or Response.BinaryWrite with large amounts of data. In Internet Server
Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) extensions, this problem may occur
when you issue synchronous WriteClient calls with large data buffers.
