KEYWORDS:kbCOMt kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbCodeSnippet kbvfp700 _IK283

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create an instance of the HttpConnector interface from Visual FoxPro
7.0, and then assign the OutputStream property to a variable, if you attempt to
access IntelliSense for that variable, the following error message appears and
Visual FoxPro closes:

   Fatal error: Exception code=C0000005

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q316964 How to Obtain the Latest Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0. This problem was first corrected in Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0
Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The HttpConnector interface is defined in the Microsoft Simple Object Access
Protocol (SOAP) object library. The Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Help
topic for HttpConnector says the following:

   "Implements the standard HTTP protocol binding for objects that send and
   receive Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) messages. HttpConnector is an
   HTTP-specific implementation of the SoapConnector interface."

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

These steps assume that you have installed the Microsoft SOAP 2.0 Toolkit or
later and that you have IntelliSense enabled in Visual FoxPro 7.0.

1. From the Visual FoxPro 7.0 Command window, execute the following lines of
   code:

   oSOAPHTTP = NEWOBJECT("mssoap.httpconnector")
   oStream = oSOAPHTTP.outputstream
   oStream

2. Place the cursor after the oStream text and press the PERIOD key to activate
   IntelliSense.
