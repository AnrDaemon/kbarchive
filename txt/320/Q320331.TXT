   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

User name mapping may become inconsistent across cluster nodes in a cluster
environment.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur if the User Name Mapping service starts without
recognizing that a cluster exists. If this occurs,, changes that are made before
the cluster is initialized may not be propagated to all of the cluster nodes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To prevent this problem from occurring, add a dependency to the User Name Mapping
component. You can make User Name Mapping dependent on the start of the Cluster
service by editing the DependOnService registry value. Follow these steps on all
the cluster nodes:

1. Using Registry Editor, locate and then click the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Mapsvc

2. Edit the DependOnService value. Add "ClusSvc" (without the quotation marks)
   to the list of services.
