SYMPTOMS
========

When you restart Internet Information Server (IIS), the following event is
logged in the event log:

   Source: IISLOG
   Error: None
   Event ID: 3

   Description: IIS Logging was unable to create the file
   C:\WINNT\System32\LogFiles\W3SVC1\ex020401.log. The data is the error.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs if you restrict the permissions on the folder that contains
the log files (for example, if the Everyone group and the IUSR_<computer>
account do not have at least Change permissions on the folders in the
C:\WINNT\System32\LogFiles folder).

You see this error only if the first request to the server is a Microsoft Active
Server Pages (ASP) page.
