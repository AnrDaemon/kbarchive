Components Setup Button On Startup Page Does Not Work
-----------------------------------------------------

During VS.Net Professional Trial DVD setup, selecting the Components Setup link
button on the bottom of the startup page results in the following error:

"Could not find the file: drive:\ServerSetup.hta"

This remote component is not supported for the trial SKU, and this error message
is expected. This button should be disregarded.
