TITLE   :Wildcard Searches Unsuccessful on Indexing Service 3.0
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Site Server version 3.0 
 - Indexing Service 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Indexing Service 3.0 to query a catalog on a server, if the query
contains the wildcard function (for example, micro*), the query does not return
the expected results.

CAUSE
=====

By default, when the query contains the wildcard function, the query for that
string is interpreted literally.

RESOLUTION
==========

The default dialect for Indexing Service 3.0 is Dialect 2, which is free-text
mode. In free-text mode, the wildcard character (*) represents itself instead of
the wildcard function. To enable wildcard functionality, you must change the
dialect to Dialect 1, or phrase mode. To do this, add the following line in your
Active Server Pages (ASP) search page, where <Query> is the name of your
instantiation of the Index Server Query server-side object:

   <Query>.Dialect = 1

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information about the Dialect property, see the following Microsoft
Developer Network (MSDN) Web site:
