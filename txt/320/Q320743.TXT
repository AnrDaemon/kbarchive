======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply a post-Service Pack 3 (SP3) Systems Management Server (SMS)
Smsapm32 hotfix, the following symptoms may occur for programs that are
configured to run with the "Only when a user is logged on" option:

 - Programs may run while no user is logged on.

 - Smsapm32 may "spin" on clients. This may cause high CPU usage and access to
   the Client Access Point (CAP). When this problem occurs, the Smsapm32.log
   file grows quickly, and SMS Trace cannot keep up with Smsapm32 log activity.

CAUSE
=====

This problem was introduced with the Q302674 hotfix. Later post-SP3 hotfixes to
the Available Programs Manager client component after version 2.0.1493.3161 also
exhibit this problem.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
