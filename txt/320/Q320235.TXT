TITLE   :SMS: Components Change to Install Pending After Service Restart
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbui kbConfig kbSecurity kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the SMS 2.0 client components on a Microsoft Windows
2000-based member server or workstation, some of the client components may
change to "Install Pending" after the 23 hour CCIM cycle, or after you restart
the SMS Client service. The following components may be affected:

 - Software Distribution Agent

 - Software Inventory Agent

The Clisvc.log file may contain the following error entry:

   ***ERROR: Unable to launch
   "C:\WINNT\MS\SMS\clicomp\SWDist32\bin\ODPUSR32.exe " - Error : 1314
   *** WNet User Groups Offer Data Provider - Error launching (#0x3EB)
   !!!WARNING: Problem starting App (1003). Doing App Verify.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may occur if a domain security policy restricts a required
privilege of the local SMSCliSvcAcct& account on the SMS client computer.
For example, "Replace process level token" may cause this behavior.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, add the required security rights to the domain
security policy for the SMSCliSvcAcct& account.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Error 1314 is "A required privilege is not held by the client."

The local security policy requirements for the SMSCliSvcAcct& account are:

 - Act as part of the operating system.

 - Increase the quotas.

 - Logon as a service.

 - Replace a process-level token.

 - Turn off the computer.

Note that the SMSCliSvcAcct& account should also be a part of the local
administrators group on the SMS client computer.
