SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install any of the products that are listed at the beginning of
this article, you may receive an error message similar to the following:

   EBUXXXX caused an exception C0000006H in module kernel32.dll at 0167:bff81960

NOTE: You may also receive a variation of this error message when you try to
install other games. The error message always includes the "C0000006H"
identifier.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may occur if the CD-ROM is dirty or damaged, or if a problem
prevents the CD-ROM drive or DVD-ROM drive from reading the disc.

RESOLUTION
==========

To troubleshoot disc-read errors, use the following methods in the order in
which they are presented.

Examine the Disc
----------------

Examine the disc for visible deformation or substantial scratches. If the disc is
damaged, see the section "How to Obtain a Replacement Disc" later in this
article.

Clean the Disc
--------------

Use a disc cleaning kit to clean the disc, or gently wipe the silver side of the
disc with a soft, lint-free cotton cloth. Do not use paper cloth, which can
scratch the plastic and leave streaks. When you clean the disc, wipe from the
center of the disc outward. Do not use a circular motion.

If the issue continues to occur, clean the disc with a damp cloth or a commercial
CD-ROM cleaning solution. Dry the disc thoroughly before you insert it into the
drive.
