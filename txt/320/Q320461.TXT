SYMPTOMS
========

When you play Microsoft Flight Simulator and turn on the Real-World Weather
feature, the weather in the game may either be incorrect or may stay the same
every day.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may occur if your Temporary Internet Files folder contains old
copies of the weather data files, and the files are not replaced with new
information.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, empty your temporary Internet files folder before you
turn on Real-World Weather. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Quit Flight Simulator.

2. Start Internet Explorer.

3. On the Tools menu, click Internet Options.

4. On the General tab, click Delete Files under "Temporary Internet files", and
   then click OK.

5. Start Flight Simulator, and then open the flight that you want to fly.

6. On the World menu, click Weather.

7. Click to select the Local Weather check box, and then click "Real-world
   weather".

8. Click OK.

Flight Simulator updates the weather to the current conditions for the flight's
current location.
