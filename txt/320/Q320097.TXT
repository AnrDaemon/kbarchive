TITLE   :XADM: Installation of Service Pack 4 Stops with Files in Use Err
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install Service Pack 4 for Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5, you
may receive an error message that states that the following files are in use:

 - Mdbperf.dll

 - Msefperf.dll

 - Mtaperf.dll

 - Perfdsa.dll

Therefore, installation of the service pack cannot continue.

Performance Monitor uses these files to track MSExchangeMTA Connections. However,
Performance Monitor does not currently run either on this computer or remotely.
If you try to run Performance Monitor locally, it does not start.

If you turn off services and restart the server, the issue is not resolved.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, you must rename these files, and then reinstall the
service pack. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open Windows Explorer.

2. Locate the drive:\Exchsrvr\BIN folder.

3. Right-click the Mdbperf.dll file, and then click Rename.

4. Type "Mdbperf.dll.old" (without the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

5. Repeat steps 3 through 4 for each file in the preceding list. Rename each
   file with an .old file name extension.

6. Close Windows Explorer.

7. Install Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 4.
