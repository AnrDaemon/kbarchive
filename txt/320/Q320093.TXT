SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to import pushpins to MapPoint 2002 or Streets &
Trips 2002 from Microsoft Expedia Streets & Trips 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To import pushpins to MapPoint 2002 or Streets & Trips 2002 from Streets
& Trips 2000, follow these steps:

1. Start Expedia Streets & Trips 2000.

2. On the File menu, click Export Pushpins.

3. Click the pushpin set that you want to export, and then click Export.

4. In the "File name" box, type "<file name>.stp" (without the quotation
   marks), where <file name> is the name of the pushpin set.

5. Quit Expedia Streets & Trips 2000.

6. Start MapPoint 2002 or Streets & Trips 2002.

7. On the Data menu, click Import Data Wizard.

8. In the "Files of type" box, click "Streets & Trips Pushpins (*.stp)".

9. Click the file that you created in steps 1 through 4, and then click Open.

NOTE: You cannot export pushpins from Microsoft MapPoint 2000. Neither MapPoint
2001 nor Streets & Trips 2001 include the Pushpin Explorer feature. These
programs now save pushpins in map files. To save pushpins that you imported to
MapPoint 2001 and Streets & Trips 2001, save the map that contains the
imported pushpins. To use the imported pushpins later, open the map that
contains them.
