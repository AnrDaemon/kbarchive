PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOSWin2000fix kbWin2000sp3fix kbWinXPsp1fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 2000 
 - Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows XP Professional 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a 1394 device performs an isochronous transfer, this operation may be
unsuccessful if certain non-page aligned data buffers are used.

CAUSE
=====

If a 1394 device driver passes non-page aligned data buffers at
REQUEST_ISOCH_ATTACH_BUFFERS time and uses the DESCRIPTOR_SYNCH_ON_SY flag in
the attached isoch descriptors, you may receive an error message on a blue
screen. Note that not all non-page aligned buffers cause this behavior. This
behavior occurs if Ohci1394.sys does not correctly map the ScatterGather DMA
array.

RESOLUTION
==========
