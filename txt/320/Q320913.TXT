TITLE   :Problems Upgrading a User-Mode Print Driver in Windows NT 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0,4.0 SP6a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400nospFix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a client uses Point and Print to connect to a networked printer, and the
printer driver on the server is changed, the client does not properly receive
the updated registry information. In other words, if the printer driver for a
shared printer is changed on the server, the driver is not upgraded on the
clients.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Localspl code detects that the driver has
changed, and may delete the registry information incorrectly.
