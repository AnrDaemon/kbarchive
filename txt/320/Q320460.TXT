SYMPTOMS

When you try to play any game on the Zone (for example, Internet Backgammon),
you may receive the following error message:

   Error: Cannot launch game. A Web page error is preventing the game from

This behavior may occur if an antivirus program or firewall program, such as
Norton Antivirus or Norton Internet Security, is installed and running on your
computer.

RESOLUTION
