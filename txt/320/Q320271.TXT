following error message is displayed:

Windows XP (not an upgrade over Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 or Microsoft Windows
98), members of the Users default group cannot download ActiveX Controls and may
experience the problem that this article describes during the HIS 2000 Web
Client installation. Similar results may occur when a user views any Web site
that contains ActiveX Controls.
