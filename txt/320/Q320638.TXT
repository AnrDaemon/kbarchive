TITLE   :SMS: Job Files May Back Up in the Scheduler.box Folder
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Job files may back up in the SMS\Inboxes\Scheduler.box and the
Inboxes\Replmgr.box\Ready folders on Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 parent
and child sites. When this occurs, the Sched.log file may contain an entry that
is similar to:

   <JOB JYF3B7Z>~ Updating status of minijob "Inter Site Replication".~
   Need to generate send request for minijob.~ Skipping minijob. Could not
   retrieve the request ID

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the required .req and .job token files are deleted
from the SMS\Inboxes\Scheduler.box\UID folder on the SMS site server.

You must not rename, modify, or delete these token files. SMS does not delete
these files under typical circumstances.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior:

1. Use a text editor to create new token .req and .job files.

2. Use a text editor to create two empty text files named <nnnnnnnn>.job
   and <nnnnnnnn>.req, where <nnnnnnnn> is a number that is higher
   than the highest number in the file name of any files that are located in the
   SMS\Inboxes\Schedule.box folder.

3. Place these files in the SMS\Inboxes\Scheduler.box\UID folder.
