======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 6.0, 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you open a menu that was created in Visual FoxPro 6.0 in Visual FoxPro 7.0,
try to convert it to the Visual FoxPro 7.0 format, and try to run the menu in
Visual FoxPro 6.0, you receive the following error message:

   Menu file is invalid.

This article describes how you can convert the menu back to the Visual FoxPro 6.0
format.

NOTE: Visual FoxPro 7.0 allows you to have pictures on the menu. Visual FoxPro
6.0 did not have this feature; as a result, if you convert the menu back to
Visual FoxPro 6.0 format, any picture information will be lost.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Start Visual FoxPro, and then set the default directory to the directory that
   contains the menu that you want to convert.

2. Create a program from the following code, and then run it from a command
   window.

NOTE: Change any instances of YourMenu in the following code to reflect the name
of the menu that you want to convert.

   * Save a copy of the menu before converting to VFP 6 format.
   COPY FILE YourMenu.* TO YourMenuSave.*
   * Delete the fields that VFP 7 adds to the menu.
   ALTER TABLE YourMenu.mnx DROP COLUMN SYSRES DROP COLUMN RESNAME
   USE

3. You can now use this menu in Visual FoxPro 6.0.
