PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbReportWriter kbvfp600 kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbCodeSnippet kbvfp700

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 6.0, 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you preview a report form that was created in Visual FoxPro 6.0 or 7.0, the
page numbers that appear in the title bar may not be incremented when you use
the navigation buttons in the report preview toolbar to move through the report.
This behavior occurs on Microsoft Windows XP-based computers. This behavior
occurs in the Visual FoxPro development environment and in compiled Visual
FoxPro programs.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, use any of the following methods:

 - Turn off visual themes for the Visual FoxPro program (if the behavior occurs
   in the development environment) or in your program file (if the behavior
   occurs in a distributable program file).

For additional information about how to turn off visual themes, click the article

 - Preview the report in a window that is not maximized. If the report preview
   window is not maximized, the page number is incremented properly.

 - Place the report preview window in a window that you define. The following
   sample code creates a window and previews the report full-screen in the
   defined window:

   PUBLIC ofrmPreview
        ofrmPreview = NEWOBJECT("PreviewForm")
           ** Replace "Report1" with the name of your report (.frx) file.
        REPORT FORM Report1 PREVIEW WINDOW "PreviewForm" NOCONSOLE
        RELEASE ofrmPreview
        
   DEFINE CLASS PreviewForm AS FORM
        HEIGHT = _SCREEN.Height
        WIDTH = _SCREEN.Width
        CAPTION = ""
        MAXBUTTON = .F.
        NAME = "PreviewForm"
   ENDDEFINE

Steps to Reproduce the Behavior

   report form home(2)+"tastrade\reports\listcust.frx" preview

2. Maximize the report.

3. On the report preview toolbar, click Next several times. The page number that
   appears in the title bar is not incremented.
