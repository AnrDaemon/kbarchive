MORE INFORMATION
================

CD-ROM: Contains Copy Of Programming Visual Basic 6.0
-----------------------------------------------------

This title correctly contains an electronic copy of Francesco Balena's
"Programming Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0." There is no electronic copy of
"Programming Microsoft Visual Basic .NET" available at this time.


Components Setup Button On Startup Page Does Not Work
-----------------------------------------------------

During VS.Net Professional Trial DVD setup, selecting the Components Setup link
button on the bottom of the startup page results in the following error:

"Could not find the file: drive:\ServerSetup.hta"

This remote component is not supported for the trial SKU, and this error message
is expected. This button should be disregarded.


Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
