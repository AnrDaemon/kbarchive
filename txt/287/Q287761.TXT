TITLE   :DB2OLEDB Provider Does Not Always Determine Nullability of Data
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupportkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The DB2OLEDB provider is not always able to reliably determine the nullability
of data. As a result of this, in some OpenQuery cases, the DB2OLEDB provider
will sometimes return DBCOLUMNFLAGS_ISNULLABLE=0 (in other words, nonnullable)
when the query is prepared, but the actual data indicates ISNULLABLE=1.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 4.0
--------------

No fix is available for SNA Server 4.0 at this time.


Host Integration Server 2000
----------------------------
