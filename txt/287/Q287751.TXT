MORE INFORMATION

The following script is an example of how TN370 workstation information can be
added to a Host Integration Server 2000 configuration through the use of WMI.
This code will fail, however, unless the fix described in the "Resolution"
section of this article is applied first.

   Set WmiLocator = CreateObject("WbemScripting.SWBemLocator")
   Set WmiNameSpace = WmiLocator.ConnectServer("","root\MicrosoftHis")
   Set WmiObj = WmiNameSpace.Get("MsSna_TN3270SessionIPFilter")
   WmiObj.Security_.impersonationLevel = 3
   Set NewWmiObj = WmiObj.SpawnInstance_

   NewWmiObj.Name="workstation1"
   NewWmiObj.Session="TN004"
   NewWmiObj.Put_ wbemFlagReturnWhenComplete
