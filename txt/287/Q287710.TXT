The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you attempt to remotely control a workstation in Systems Management Server
(SMS) 2.0, you may be prompted to supply valid logon credentials to make the
connection.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To remotely control a workstation, the following items must be configured
correctly for the user account of the person who is attempting to take remote
control:

 - The user account must be added to the Permitted Viewers list in the SMS
   Administrator Console. Alternately, remote control also succeeds if the user
   is a member of the Local Administrators group on the computer on which the
   user is attempting to use remote control. In addition to adding individual
   users to the list of permitted viewers, you can grant rights to remote
   control by adding global groups to the list of permitted viewers.

   NOTE: In some cases, if you include the domain name in front of the global
   group, you may be prompted for permissions.

 - The user account must have access to Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM),
   to access the collection that contains the target computer. Access to WBEM is
   generally granted by including the user in the SMSAdmins local group on the
   SMS site server. If you do not want to add the user as part of the SMSAdmins
   local group, you can grant access to WBEM by using WBEMPERM (in Microsoft
   Windows NT 4.0) or the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Control
   Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in (in Microsoft Windows 2000).

   NOTE: If you add a user to the SMSAdmins local group, it does not indicate
   that the user has full administrative rights to SMS. Full administrative
   rights are granted by using the security manager in the SMS Administrator
   Console. The only function of the SMSAdmins local group is to provide access
   to WBEM.

 - The user account must have appropriate rights (to collections, and so on) in
   the SMS Security Manager.
