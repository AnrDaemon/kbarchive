The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 98 
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to a network printer whose share name contains spaces, you may
receive the following error message:

   Error loading printer driver.

With Visual FoxPro version 3.0b, you receive the following error message:

   Printer is not ready.

This error only occurs if multiple printers are installed, and the printer with
the space in the share name is not the default printer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Make the printer with spaces in the share name the default printer.

 - Change the share name so that it contains no spaces.

Note that you may need to quit and restart Visual FoxPro for these workarounds to
take effect.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Install a printer on a Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 Server computer and
   share the printer. Be sure to use a share name that contains spaces.

2. Install two printers on a Windows 98 or Windows Millennium Edition (Me)
   machine: one that has no spaces in the share name, and the printer that you
   installed in Step 1. Make sure that the printer without spaces in the share
   name is the default printer.

3. Create a report with the name TestPrint and add one field. Use
   TestPrint.TestField for the expression.

4. Create a program using the following code:
