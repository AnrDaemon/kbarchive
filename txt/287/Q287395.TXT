SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) on a computer that is
running Windows NT Workstation or Server 4.0, you may receive the following
error message when you try to connect by using dial-up networking (DUN):

   TCP/IP Reported Error 2 : Could Not Find File Specified

The error message appears when the Registering Your Computer on the Network
dialog box appears. In addition, the Network tool in Control Panel lists a
nonexistent network adapter, Ncpa.cpl, that has a numeric value, for example 10.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, delete the nonexistent network adapter from the
registry:
WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate and click the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkCards

3. Locate and delete the empty folder that bears the name of the nonexistent
   network adapter, Ncpa.cpl.

4. Quit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.
