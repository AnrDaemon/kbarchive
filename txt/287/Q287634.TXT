TITLE   :EnhancedSecurityLevel of "1" Causes "Stop 0x1E" Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0 SP6
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP6, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you change the domain password with a C2-security registry entry enabled,
you may receive a "Stop 0x1E" error message. This problem can occur if you have
Service Pack 6 (SP6) installed and the following registry entry is set:

   Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager
   Value: EnhancedSecurityLevel (REG_DWORD)
   Data value: 1

This key ensures that Object Manager can change the attributes of a kernel object
in the Object table for the current process if (and only if) the previous mode
of the caller is Kernel mode.

If you attempt to change the password after you set this registry value, you
receive the following error message:

   Stop 0x0000001e (0xc0000005, 0x8019bb12, 0x00000000, 0x0000022c)
