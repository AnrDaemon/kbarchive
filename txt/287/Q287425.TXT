The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you modify the Sms_def.mof file to collect information from the
NetworkLoginProfile class during hardware inventory, the account information may
not be returned as expected.

This article describes the necessary requirements to successfully use the
NetworkLoginProfile class in the Sms_def.mof file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The NetworkLoginProfile class enumerates all local profiles and network accounts
for a computer, and it then queries a domain controller to gain information
about those accounts. In versions of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
earlier than 1.5, this enumeration is inaccurate. WMI version 1.5 successfully
completes class enumeration. You can obtain the latest version of WMI by
clicking the link in the "References" section of this article. Only WMI version
1.1 is included in the Systems Management Server (SMS) service packs.

For computers that are running either Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows 98,
or Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition (SE), you may have to enable the creation
of profiles for this class to work properly. For Windows 98-based computers, you
configure this in Control Panel by using the Users program tool. For Windows
95-based computers, you configure this in Control Panel by using the Passwords
program tool.
