SUMMARY
=======

When you use Basic authentication to connect to a Web site that is hosted by
Internet Information Services (IIS), you can take advantage of the delegation
features of Kerberos to authenticate on multiple back-end servers, such as a
Microsoft SQL Server that is called from Active Server Pages (ASP) running on
IIS. To generate a Kerberos token, IIS must be a member of a Windows 2000 domain
and have access to that domain's active directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When IIS authenticates users it does so by calling the LsaLogonUser function,
which in turn calls an authentication package
(MICROSOFT_AUTHENTICATION_PACKAGE_V1_0 for Basic authentication). When Basic
authentication occurs, the following event is written to the security log IIS
5.0 server, assuming the Audit Logon Events policy is enabled:

   Event Type:	Success Audit
   Event Source:	Security
   Event Category:	Logon/Logoff 
   Event ID:	528
   Date:		1/5/2001
   Time:		6:11:04 PM
   User:		Win2kDomain\rvittal
   Computer:	IIS5server
   Description:
   Successful Logon:
    	User Name:       	rvittal
    	Domain:		Win2kDomain
    	Logon ID:		(0x0,0x148D0AC)
    	Logon Type:	             2
    	Logon Process:	IIS     
    	Authentication Package:	MICROSOFT_AUTHENTICATION_PACKAGE_V1_0
    	Workstation Name:	IIS5server<BR/>

After a user has logged into IIS with Basic authentication, IIS has that user's
credentials (username:password), and can use those credentials to generate a
token that can be used to impersonate the user on other computers. When a user
requests a Web page that references resources on another Windows 2000 server,
the IIS server generates a Kerberos security token and an event similar to the
following is written in the security log on the remote server:

   Event Type:	Success Audit
   Event Source:	Security
   Event Category:	Logon/Logoff 
   Event ID:	540
   Date:		1/5/2001
   Time:		1:16:06 PM
   User:		Win2kDomain\rvittal
   Computer:	SQLbox
   Description:
   Successful Network Logon:
    	User Name:	             rvittal
    	Domain:		Win2kDomain
    	Logon ID:		(0x0,0x13A667F)
    	Logon Type:	             3
    	Logon Process:	             Kerberos
    	Authentication Package: Kerberos
    	Workstation Name:	

Note that using Kerberos is not limited to Basic authentication. By default, if a
Windows 2000 client attaches to an IIS5 server that is configured with
Integrated authentication, Kerberos authentication is used.
