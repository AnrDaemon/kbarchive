   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you stop and restart the Spooler service, and you then try to print a file,
you may receive the following error message:

   Test page fail to print the handle is invalid

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because some printer ports disappear after you stop and
then restart the Spooler service.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the behavior, remove from the registry any LPR port names that have
invalid characters:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32).

2. Locate and click the following entry in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors\LPR
   Port\Ports\

3. Delete any of the keys that contain LPR port names that include invalid
   characters.

4. Restart the computer.
