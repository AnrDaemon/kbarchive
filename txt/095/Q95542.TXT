The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

The 5.25-inch size disks for the TrueType Font Pack 2 contain a duplicate file
called FONT002.IN_. This file is located on both Disk 1 and Disk 2. This
duplication causes problems if both disks are copied to the same directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

 - The file FONT002.IN_ located on Disk 1 has a compressed size of 3745
   kilobytes (K).

 - The file FONT002.IN_ located on Disk 2 has a compressed size of 3709K.

When expanded, these files are identical in size and content and only serve as
source media descriptors. If one of the FONT002.IN_ files is damaged, if both
files are not present, or if you run Setup from a directory containing the
contents of all three disks, the following error is generated during Setup

   Could not open the file named: <X>:\DISK1\PSCRIPT.DR_

where <X> is the drive from which you are installing the Font Pack 2.

If all disks are copied to one subdirectory, the FONT002.IN_ file from Disk 1 is
overwritten by the FONT002.IN_ file from Disk 2, which results in the above
error.

To work around this problem, either run Setup from the original disks, or copy
each disk to separate directories and run Setup from the Disk 1 directory,
specifying the Disk 2 and 3 directories when you are prompted for the remaining
disks.
