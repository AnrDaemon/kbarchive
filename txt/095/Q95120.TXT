The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not
been tested and are not supported by Microsoft.

If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.

SUMMARY
=======

The Intel EtherExpress 16 MCA is not directly supported or specifically listed
in the Network Adapter options in Windows for Workgroups version 3.1. However,
this network adapter should operate with Windows for Workgroups if it is set up
correctly.

NOTE: The Intel EtherExpress MCA IS supported in later versions of Windows for
Workgroups.

The Intel EtherExpress 16 MCA is the Microchannel version of the Intel
EtherExpress 16 or 16 TP that Microsoft ships with the Windows for Workgroups
Starter Kits and User Kits. Both network adapters use the same Media Access
Control (MAC) driver. The Microchannel version of the Intel EtherExpress 16
should not require any changes to the PROTOCOL.INI or any other configuration
files in order to operate with Windows for Workgroups.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install and configure the EtherExpress MCA LAN Adapter for use with Windows
for Workgroups version 3.1, use the following steps:

1. Install and set up the Intel EtherExpress MCA using the reference disk
   provided with the adapter.

2. Make note of the configuration, such as the IRQ, I/O Port address, and Base
   Memory settings.

3. During the installation of Windows for Workgroups, select the Intel
   EtherExpress 16 or 16 TP when prompted for the network adapter card
   information.

4. The IRQ, I/O Port, and Base Memory settings must match those that were set up
   using the reference disk.

   NOTE: If the card settings are changed at any time in the future, make sure
   those same changes are made in the Control Panel Network Adapters Settings
   section. Conversely, if IRQ, I/O or Base Memory settings are ever changed
   with the Control Panel or in the PROTOCOL.INI file, be sure to use the
   reference diskette and make the corresponding changes.

For additional information, contact Intel technical support.

The EtherExpress 16 MCA is manufactured by Intel, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this products'
performance or reliability.
