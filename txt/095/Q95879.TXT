TITLE   :VINES Err Msg: BAN: Unable to Read 'PCCONFIG.DB' with WFWG
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If Banyan VINES connectivity is installed and Windows for Workgroups has been
installed on a drive other than drive C, the following error message may appear
during startup when the BAN.EXE driver executes from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   BAN: Unable to read 'PCCONFIG.DB' configuration database.

In addition, this may cause the ARSWAIT.EXE terminate-and-stay- resident (TSR)
program to stop the system.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Banyan VINES Setup program inserts the following
line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file

      CD X:\WINDOWS

where X is the drive on which Windows for Workgroups is installed. This command
changes the working directory on drive X but does not actually change to drive
X. Because the BAN.EXE TSR must be executed from the same directory where the
PCCONFIG.DB file is located, the drivers fail to load and the above error
message occurs during startup.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the error message, use any text editor to insert the following
command line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file prior to the CD X:\WINDOWS line (where X
is the drive on which Windows for Workgroups is installed):

      X:
