The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22

SUMMARY
=======

If you use an MS-DOS multiple configuration menu, your CONFIG.SYS file becomes
scrambled when you install Brooklyn Bridge version 3.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Installing Brooklyn Bride on a system using a multiple configuration menu
results in the following:

 - All blank lines are removed.

 - A screen dump (both character and attributes) is inserted into the middle of
   the CONFIG.SYS file.

 - DEVICE=BRIDGE1.DEV is added to an unexpected location, such as the end of and
   existing CONFIG.SYS command.

The Brooklyn Bridge installation program does not give the user a choice to
update the CONFIG.SYS file - it is done automatically. However, Brooklyn Bridge
does create a backup CONFIG.SYS file called CONFIG.OLD.

NOTE: This problem may apply to other versions of Brooklyn Bridge; Microsoft has
confirmed this with Brooklyn Bridge version 3.5 only.

The product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft;
