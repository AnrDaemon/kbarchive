TITLE   :Manual Installation Err Msg: Incompatible Partition
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.21,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to perform a manual installation of MS-DOS Upgrade, using the
"You need to install MS-DOS manually" procedure in Diagnosing and Solving
Problems, step 3 says to use the SETUP /Q command. However, if Setup detects you
have a special master boot record (MBR) or an incompatible partition, Setup
displays the "Incompatible partition" screen.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you have one of the following drives and you receive this error message, run
setup with the /U and /Q switches (for example, A:SETUP /U /Q).

 - Priam

 - Everex

 - SpeedStor Bootall

 - Micro House DrivePro

If you use SETUP /I without the /U switch, you will continue to receive the error
message.

NOTE: This information was inadvertently omitted from an early printing of the
User's Guide; the omission was corrected in subsequent printings.

Installing the Optional Programs
--------------------------------

If you attempt to install the optional programs at a later date, you should also
use the /U switch. For example:

   setup /u /e

Setup Syntax
------------

/E Installs Windows and MS-DOS optional programs. /Q Copies MS-DOS files to a
hard disk. /U Installs MS-DOS even if Setup detects disk partitions that might
be incompatible with MS-DOS 6.x.

For more information of Setup switches, insert MS-DOS 6.x Upgrade Setup Disk 1 in
one of your floppy disk drives, change to that drive at the MS-DOS command
prompt and type "SETUP /?" (without the quotation marks).
