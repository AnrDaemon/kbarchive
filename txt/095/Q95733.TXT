TITLE   :PC Win: Spell Does Not Check Words Containing Numbers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The spelling checker in Microsoft Mail version 3.0 for Windows does not check
words that contain numbers. Therefore, a misspelling such as "Th8s" is not
flagged as incorrect.

CAUSE
=====

The spelling checker API has the ability to turn on or off the "Ignore checking
of words with numbers" option. Mail forces this option on and does not allow you
the ability to turn it off.

This feature is by design.
