The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, 2.5a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Issuing a SQL SELECT command with the INTO CURSOR clause creates a
read-only cursor. To create a modifiable cursor, use one of the
following workarounds:

 - Use the SQL SELECT command with the INTO TABLE or INTO DBF clause. This
   command creates a new permanent database that can be deleted when it is no
   longer needed.

 - Use the following code (which uses the FoxPro 2.x CUSTOMER table):

         USE c:\foxpro2\tutorial\customer.dbf
           * USE the database that is being queried.
         =AFIELDS(struct_arr)
           * The array struct_arr contains the database structure.
         CREATE CURSOR temp FROM ARRAY struct_arr
           * temp has the structure of CUSTOMER.DBF.
         SELECT * FROM customer INTO ARRAY data_arr
           * data_arr contains the result of the query.
         SELECT temp
         APPEND FROM ARRAY data_arr
           * temp now contains the result of the query
           * and is not read-only.

   NOTE: This example works only if the SQL SELECT command is from a single
   database and all fields are being selected. If this is not the case, you can
   modify struct_arr to reflect the structure of the fields being selected, or
   use the CREATE CURSOR command to create a temporary table with the
   appropriate structure.
