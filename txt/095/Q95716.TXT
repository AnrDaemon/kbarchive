The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Page A-7 in the FoxPro 2.5 for MS-DOS "Developer's Guide" and page B-7 in the
FoxPro 2.5 for Windows "Developer's Guide" state the following about the error
message "Cannot create program workspace":

   Cannot create program workspace
   FoxPro was not able to create enough workspace upon startup.
   This may be due to insufficient rights to the directory or not enough disk
   space.

"Workspace" is the area where FoxPro does temporary work during execution. Note
there must be enough available disk space to store these temporary files;
normally, 2 MB is adequate.

NOTE: In Visual FoxPro, this error message is described in online Help, under the
"Error Message" topic.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MS-DOS version of FoxPro creates its temporary files in the current working
directory unless an alternative location is specified by including one or more
of the SORTWORK, EDITWORK, PROGWORK, and/or TMPFILES statements in the CONFIG.FP
file.

FoxPro for Windows, however, will create its temporary files in the same
directory in which Windows stores its temporary files unless an alternative
location is specified by including one or more of the SORTWORK, EDITWORK,
PROGWORK, and/or TMPFILES statements in the CONFIG.FPW file. The location of
Windows .TMP files is set by the MS-DOS TEMP environment variable, which is
specified in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
