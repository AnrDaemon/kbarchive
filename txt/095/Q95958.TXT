KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you install DoubleSpace on a hard drive, DoubleSpace creates a compressed
volume file (CVF), but when DoubleSpace runs Defragmenter (Defrag), you receive
the following error message:

   ATTENTION: A serious disk error occurred writing to drive x:

where x is the drive you are compressing. There are no options at this point
other than restarting the computer.

When you restart the computer, DoubleSpace recovers and completes the
installation. DoubleSpace ignores any clusters marked as unusable in the file
allocation table (FAT).

CAUSE
=====

Your hard drive has physical errors (such as unusable sectors).

WORKAROUND
==========

Run a disk repair utility such as Norton Disk Doctor (NDD) before you compress
the drive.

Norton Disk Doctor is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make
no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
