The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Page L3-430 of the "Language Reference" manual describes the IN DESKTOP clause
of the DEFINE WINDOW command. The last sentence of this section incorrectly
states,

   The position of the window is relative to the Windows desktop, and size of
   the window is determined by the current font of the main FoxPro window.

This last sentence should instead read:

   The position of the window is relative to the Windows desktop, and the
   current font of the main FoxPro window.

This statement omits the phrase, "size of the window is determined by." The size
of the window is determined by the FONT clause, not the font of the main FoxPro
window. The FONT clause is placed in the DEFINE WINDOW statement itself. If the
FONT clause is omitted, 10-point FoxFont is used, as stated on page L3-430 of
the "Language Reference."
