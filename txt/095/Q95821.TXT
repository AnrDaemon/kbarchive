   disc, or click 'Exit' to leave Multimedia <Composer Title>.

This message may be caused by one of the following:

1. The CD-ROM drive may be turned off or the multimedia CD may not be in the
   drive. Make sure the CD-ROM drive is turned on.

2. The [MCI] CD Audio driver may not be installed in the Drivers section of the
   Control Panel. Install the [MCI] CD Audio driver in the Control Panel if it
   is not installed.

3. The CD may be dirty or physically damaged. Clean the disc with a soft cloth.
   If the disc is physically damaged, it will need to be replaced.

4. You have another application open (such as Media Player) that uses the
   CD-Audio driver (set to CD-Audio), or any Windows CD player running such as
   Music Box, which comes with Microsoft Windows Sound System.

5. The CD is not in the first available CD-ROM drive.
