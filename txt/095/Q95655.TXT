TITLE   :Errors Connecting to Server During Over-the-Network Setup
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

You may receiving the following errors when you install or upgrade a Microsoft
LAN Manager MS-DOS workstation with an over-the-network (OTN) installation
disk:

Error 1: Access Denied
----------------------

Cause: The server you are using for the network installation share must have a
guest account.

Error 2: Bad command or filename
--------------------------------

Cause: The guest and USER accounts must have read and execute (RX) privileges for
the C:\LANMAN\NINSTALL directory.

Error 3: Connection refused or syntax error
-------------------------------------------

Cause: The guest account must not have a password. Any or all of these can be
caused by an incorrectly configured guest account on the server with the network
installation share. Ways of correcting this are found in the MORE INFORMATION
section below.

Because this article deals with several problems arising from one cause, it
differs in style from the usual PRB article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The OTN boot disk uses the LAN Manager basic workstation redirector. The program
UNIQSTRT (listed in the AUTOEXEC.BAT of the OTN install disk) generates a random
name so it can start the redirector with "net start workstation unique_name."

A LAN Manager Basic MS-DOS workstation is not actually "logged on" to the domain
and validated by the NETLOGON service, so no password is required. If you want
to access a share with a password from an MS-DOS basic workstation, you must
enter the password when you request access to the share (for example, NET USE
\\SERVER\SHARE PASSWORD). If you fail to give the correct password for the
account, you receive the following error:

   connection refused or syntax error

Therefore, if there is a password on the guest account, the OTN installation
fails when it tries to access the install share on the server.

There are several ways to remove the password on a guest account:

 - You can use NET ADMIN (Accounts, Users, Guest Zoom and then put spaces in the
   password field, then backspace over the entire thing. (It's not elegant, but
   it works.)

 - You can use the NET USER command, as follows:

   net user guest ""

 - If you know what the password on your guest account is, you can use the NET
   PASSWORD command:

   net password oldpassword ""

If there is some reason you want to have a password on your guest account, edit
the NET USE line in the OTN install disk's AUTOEXEC.BAT as follows:

   net use \\server\ninstall guestpassword

Another problem can occur when you change the default name for the guest account
using the optional entry "guestacct" in the [server] section of the LANMAN.INI.

When you set up a server in a domain, LAN Manager installs a user account with
the username guest and no password in the user accounts database. The "password
required" parameter for the guest account is set to "no" (NET USER GUEST
/PASSWORDREQ:NO).

When you create any other user account, the default value for the /PASSWORDREQ
parameter is "yes." If you don't change the password required parameter for your
new guest account, the rules about password size will apply, and you may not be
able to remove the password for your guest account. (You can use the Net
Accounts command to check the minimum password length.)

For example, the command

   net user guest_account_name ""

may return the error message:

   NET2245: The password is shorter than required

To resolve this problem:

 - Change the password required flag

   net user visitor /passwordreq:no

-or-

 - Change the minimum password length

   net accounts /minpwlen:0
