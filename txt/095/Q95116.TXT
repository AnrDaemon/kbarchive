TITLE   :WFWG: System Hangs with Novell NetWare and Token Ring
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you copy files to a Novell NetWare file server using Windows for Workgroups
with NetWare Connectivity and the IBM Token Ring 4/16 network adapter, the
system may stop responding (hang) and/or files may become corrupted.

Symptoms may include system hangs when copying files to a NetWare server from the
Windows for Workgroups File Manager or from an MS-DOS command prompt (either
inside or outside Windows).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around these problems:

Windows for Workgroups 3.1
--------------------------

Use the Advanced Card Settings option in Control Panel to increase the number of
transmit buffers and the transmit and receive buffer sizes.

Windows for Workgroups 3.11
---------------------------

Use the Network Setup icon in the Network group to increase the number of
transmit buffers and the transmit and receive buffer sizes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The default values for the number of transmit buffers and the transmit and
receive buffer sizes may not be large enough for some IBM Token Ring
configurations, particularly those running at 16 Mbps.

The Token Ring specifications define a maximum length of time any adapter can
hold the token. This, along with the hardware capabilities of the Token Ring
adapter, determine the buffer sizes you should use. The following are valid
ranges for RECVBUFSIZE and XMITBUFSIZE:

   Adapter                            Range
   --------------------------------------------

   4 Mbs Adapter                      256-2040
   4/16 Adapter Running at 4Mb        256-4096
   4/16 Adapter Running at 16Mb       256-17952

Use the Advanced Card Settings option in Control Panel to change the settings as
follows:

   XMITBUFS=2         (default is 1, maximum is 2)
   XMITBUFSIZE=1024   (default is 256, recommended is 2040)
   RECVBUFSIZE=1024   (default is 256, recommended is 2040)
