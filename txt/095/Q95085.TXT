SUMMARY
=======

When using the Windows Sound System version 1.0 Voice Pilot, it is possible to
temporarily turn off the microphone without closing Voice Pilot. While the Voice
Pilot is active, press the CTRL+ALT keys to pause the microphone's input. If the
Voice Pilot is minimized, the hash marks appearing around the microphone icon
should disappear.

To resume recording with the microphone, press the CTRL+ALT keys again and the
hash marks will reappear. This key combination does not work for pausing and
resuming microphone input within the Quick Recorder.
