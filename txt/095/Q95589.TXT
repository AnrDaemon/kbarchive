======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6x 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5x, 2.6x 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following switches to the SET PRINTER TO \\SPOOLER command do not
consistently direct the printer setup on a Novell network:

   \NB               Suppresses the printing of a banner page.
   \F = <expN>       Specifies the form number to print on.
   \B = <banner>     Specifies a banner name.
   \C = <expN>       Specifies the number of copies to be printed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs only with the Novell 3.26 shell or later. Older versions of
the software work correctly, but they may produce other problems if you are
using Windows. Novell 3.26 or later is the preferred software to use with
Windows.

RESOLUTION
==========

These options should be set by using the RUN command to shell out to MS-DOS and
then using the Novell CAPTURE command. After printing, you must close the print
file and send the print job. To do this, either issue a RUN ENDCAP command or
quit FoxPro.
