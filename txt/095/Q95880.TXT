TITLE   :Banyan VINES Pop-Up Application Does Not Function with WFWG
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows-based Banyan VINES Pop-Up application MESSAGES.EXE does not work
correctly with Windows for Workgroups.

The Banyan VINES network operating system versions 4.11 and higher provides a
message service that can send and receive messages from within Windows using the
MESSAGES.EXE program. When you use Windows for Workgroups with the VINES
connectivity drivers, you hear a sound when a message is received but the
MESSAGES.EXE program continues to show that no messages have been received.

NOTE: This problem may also affect other messenger-based VINES applications.

WORKAROUND
==========

To view the messages, use the MS-DOS-based LASTMSG.EXE program, which correctly
shows all messages received since you logged in.

STATUS
======

Banyan Systems has confirmed this to be a problem with its Windows for
Workgroups drivers and can be contacted for further information.

Banyan VINES is manufactured by Banyan Systems, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
