SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows version 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 print to
PostScript printers slightly slower than Windows 3.0 does because they must
convert TrueType fonts to Type 1 fonts as the document is printing. This slowing
can be avoided by disabling TrueType fonts in Control Panel, but it is not
recommended.

In addition, Windows 3.1 Print Manager holds the whole print job until it has all
the data. It then sends the job to the printer in the background.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 3.0 Print Manager does not function as a true print spooler. In Windows
3.0, part of the print job is sent to Print Manager. After Print Manager has
printed that portion of the print job, it then returns to Windows to get another
piece.

In Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups, you get control of your machine back
more quickly; however, as a trade-off, it takes longer to complete the print job
because it is being spooled out in the background.
