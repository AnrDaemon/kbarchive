TITLE   :PC Win: Offline Symbol Appears in Status Bar
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0a,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The offline (or net disconnect) symbol appears in the status bar of Microsoft
Mail versions 3.0, 3.0a, and 3.0b for Windows; however, Mail appears to function
as usual.

CAUSE
=====

An ownerless mail message file (*.MMF) on the Microsoft Mail postoffice on a
Novell NetWare server may cause this symbol to appear.

RESOLUTION
==========

To assign ownership, the supervisor must run Filer (select the root of the
postoffice when all users are off Mail) and change the entire directory tree to
supervisor ownership.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the Novell NetWare operating system, a file on a server receives ownership
when it is created or copied within the server, with ownership assigned to the
user who last effected the file. If a user is removed from the bindery (the
Novell server database of users and resources), all files under ownership of the
user at the time become ownerless. The files will remain ownerless--even if the
user is added back to the bindery--until a user (or users) affect the files.

To check for ownerless files, type "NDIR" (without the quotation marks) at the
command prompt from the directory in question. An excerpt from a sample NDIR
listing follows:

LECTOR/SYS:PUBLIC

Any ownerless files will show up in the NDIR listing under "Owner" as N/A (see
above).
