SUMMARY
=======

The Standard Adlib card manufactured by Adlib Multimedia Incorporated cannot
play or record .WAV files; it can play .MID files only.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Standard Adlib card is a MIDI synthesizer. It cannot send MIDI information
to an external device. This information applies to the Standard Adlib card only.
The Gold Adlib card does support playing and recording .MID and .WAV files.

To make a Standard Adlib card play .WAV files, you must use a third-party sound
driver. Availability and support for these drivers are the responsibility of the
driver manufacturer. One such driver is ADLIBWV.DRV, which is available in the
Intermission for Windows screen saver manufactured by Icom Simulations.

For more information about Intermission for Windows, contact Icom Simulations.

For more information about Adlib devices, contact Adlib Multimedia.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
or reliability.
