TITLE   :DELTREE: No Error Message If Directory Does Not Exist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When the DELTREE.EXE command is executed on a directory that does not exist, no
error message is displayed and you are returned to the MS-DOS prompt. This
behavior can be misleading if you mistype a directory name--since no error
message is displayed, you may think that the directory you were trying to delete
was successfully deleted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the directory you want to delete is specified correctly with the DELTREE.EXE
command, you will receive the following message:

   Delete directory <DirectoryName> and all of its subdirectories? [yn]

where <DirectoryName> is the name of the directory you want to delete. You
are required to answer "y" to delete the entire subdirectory or "n" to cancel
the operation.

For more information on the DELTREE command, type "HELP DELTREE" (without the
quotation marks) at the command prompt.
