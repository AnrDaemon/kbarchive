The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Golf for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The files on the Microsoft Golf disks are compressed using the standard Windows
compression method. They can be extracted by typing the following at the MS-DOS
command prompt and pressing ENTER (For information about how to get to the
MS-DOS command prompt under Windows 95, see your printed Windows documentation
or online Help.)

   expand <drive1:>filename.ex_ <drive2:>\msgolf\filename.ext

where "drive" is your floppy disk drive, "filename.ex_" is the compressed file,
"drive2" is your hard disk drive, and the "filename.ext" is the expanded file.
For example, type the following command to expand the Torrey Pines course from
drive A into the MSGOLF directory on drive C:

   expand a:torrey_p.cr_ c:\msgolf\torrey_p.crs

Note that with the 720K disks, the TORREY_P.CRS file is actually split between
Disks 2 and 3. In this case, it is necessary to combine the files first. This
can be done typing the following command:

   copy torrey_p.c1_ /b + torrey_p.c2_ /b torrey_p.cr_

The /b switch specifies a binary copy operation. Once this has been done, the
file can be expanded normally. The underscore on the filename's extension
indicates that the file is compressed.

If you are installing Golf into a shared Windows configuration, or when there are
other problems during installation, this may be the only way to install the
program.

In the C:\WINDOWS directory, a Program Manager Group file is added when the icon
is created. This file is not located on any of the Golf disks:

   C:\WINDOWS\MICROSOF.GRP

The following files are installed in the C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory:

   C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\VRSD.386

In the SYSTEM.INI file, the following line is added to the [386Enh] section:

     DEVICE=VRSD.386

This totals 73 files and 2 directories created on the destination disk.

Remember that Golf was designed to be installed using the Setup program, not by
manual installation. The procedure outlined above is to be used as a last
resort.
