-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 is limited to 255 open file handles per
machine. This Windows for Workgroups limitation is caused by the MS-DOS limit of
255 open files at one time.

Windows for Workgroups 3.11 has the following open file handle limits:

 - In an MS-DOS virtual machine (VM) you are limited to 254 file handles.

 - The Windows for Workgroups Server VM provides file and print services. The
   Server VM allows 1024 file handles for remote users if 32-bit file access is
   enabled and 255 files handles if it is not.

 - If you are using 32-bit file access, there is a theoretical limit equal to
   the amount of free RAM.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some applications may require a server to have more than 255 files open at one
time. For example, a database application may have 255 files open at one time on
a Windows for Workgroups server. If this limit is exceeded, you may receive
application-specific error message concerning open files or memory.

There are no workarounds to these limitations for Windows for Workgroups.
