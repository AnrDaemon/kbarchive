TITLE   :Extra Tools Menu Added to Norton Desktop for Windows
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.21,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

If Windows is installed on your computer when you run the MS-DOS 6 Upgrade Setup
program, Setup installs a Tools menu in the File Manager toolbar. If you use
Norton Desktop for Windows, you have two Tools menus after you install the
MS-DOS Upgrade.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Norton Desktop for Windows has one Tools menu and
inherits a second one from File Manager by reading the WINFILE.INI file.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can keep both Tools menus in Norton Desktop for Windows or you can remove
the second Tools menu by telling Norton Desktop for Windows to ignore the
add-ins section in the File Manager information file (WINFILE.INI).To configure
Norton Desktop for Windows to ignore File Manager add-ins, set the
MaxWinFileExtensions line to "0" (without the quotation marks) (zero) in your
NDW.INI file, for example:

   " MaxWinFileExtensions=0 " (without the quotation marks)

This disables all of the add-ins inherited from File Manager.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The two tools menus have different functions. The Tools menu in File Manager and
the Tools menu in Norton Desktop for Windows give you the following options:

  Command               Description
