TITLE   :RAS and TCPIP_HUB Conflict on One Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

You may encounter problems if you run the Remote Access Service (RAS) and the
TCPIP_HUB service simultaneously on one LAN Manager Server. The TCPIP_HUB
service should start without any problems, but RAS fails with this error:

   NET3055: A problem exists with the system configuration: The system is not
   configured correctly.

   The LAN Manager Error Log reports these errors:

   3299 RAS0733. RAS was Unable to bind COM1 to ASYBEUI.
   3299 RAS0731. RAS did not start because it was unable to open any COM ports.

Note: Some customers have reported that this combination of services can cause a
trap error.

CAUSE
=====

The cause of this problem has not been completely identified. The redirector may
not be allocating an additional LANA structure for one of the net x lines in the
LANMAN.INI file.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Open the C:\LANMAN\LANMAN.INI file in a text editor (for example, Notepad).

2. Remove the TCPIP_HUB and REMOTEACCESS parameters from the SRVSERVICES line.

3. Open the C:\STARTUP.CMD file in a text editor (for example, Notepad).

4. After the NET START SERVER line, add these two lines in this order:

         net start remoteaccess
         net start tcpip_hub
