-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not
been tested and are not supported by Microsoft.

If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.

SUMMARY
=======

This article contains information about modifying Windows for Workgroups version
3.1 for use with Artisoft's LANtastic network operating system. If the following
procedures do not allow connectivity between Windows for Workgroups and
LANtastic, call Artisoft Technical Support at (602) 670-7000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft does not ensure the stability of Windows for Workgroups when running
with Artisoft's LANtastic.

Artisoft has provided the following modifications so that you can use components
of Windows for Workgroups with MS-DOS-based LANtastic versions 4.x and with
LANtastic for Windows.

NOTE: If you make the following changes according to Artisoft's specifications,
the Windows for Workgroups peer-to-peer and networking capabilities are
disabled.

LANtastic provides its own networking functionality as if it were running with
Windows 3.1, with added support for Mail and Schedule+. For the MS-DOS based
versions of LANtastic to use any Windows for Workgroups components, a file
called LANTNET.DRV is required. This file may be obtained from Artisoft's
bulletin board service (BBS) at (602) 293-0065.

Windows for Workgroups can use all Artisoft's "AE" boards when the cards are set
for the NE2000 mode. Additionally, the Intel EtherExpress 16-bit network
interface card that ships with Windows for Workgroups is compatible with
LANtastic/AI cards. It requires the driver EXP16LAN.EXE, which is available by
calling Intel's BBS at (503) 645-6275. If you loaded Windows for Workgroups
using the Intel EtherExpress adapter card, the low-level drivers from the
CONFIG.SYS file must be removed. The current network card compatibility list on
Artisoft's BBS should be checked for further information on other types of
compatible adapters.

With a normal installation of Windows for Workgroups, a LANtastic network does
not function at all. Windows for Workgroups has its own redirector (REDIR),
server functions, and low-level drivers (which are incompatible with the
LANtastic system).

Required Changes to SYSTEM.INI
------------------------------

To replace a Windows for Workgroups network with a LANtastic network, make the
following changes to the SYSTEM.INI file.

1. In the [Boot] section, change

         network=wfwnet.drv

   to:

         network.drv=lantnet.drv

2. In the [386Enh] section, change

         NetHeapSize=20

   to:

         NetHeapSize=64

3. Add the following lines to the [386Enh] section:

         NetAsynchFallback=TRUE
         NetAsynchTimout=5.0
         PerVMFiles=0

4. Add the following lines to the [LANtastic] section:

         Network_IRQ=xx

   where xx is the appropriate IRQ setting for your machine.

Resulting Functionality
-----------------------

After you make these changes, normal LANtastic networking functionality is
available, with the following additions:

   Mail
   Schedule+
   Network File Manager
   ClipBook Viewer

NOTE: The ClipBook Viewer cannot share files across the network, but it does work
locally.

The LANtastic for Windows dynamic data exchange (DDE) features function; however,
the following Windows for Workgroups network DDE programs do not work:

   Chat
   Hearts
   VSERVER.386
   NetWatcher
   WinMeter

---------

Any questions concerning the conversion of Windows for Workgroups network should
be directed to Artisoft Technical Support.
