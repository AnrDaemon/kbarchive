TITLE   :Less Disk Space After Converting a Stacker Drive
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you convert a drive from Stacker to DoubleSpace, DoubleSpace might show that
you have less compressed disk space than you had with Stacker.

CAUSE
=====

This apparent disparity occurs because DoubleSpace is thoroughly integrated with
the MS-DOS operating system and can more accurately estimate compressed disk
space. In fact, you may actually have more compressed disk space than you had
before the conversion, regardless of what was reported.

In addition, DoubleSpace continually updates its compressed disk space estimates.
As a result, as you work with a compressed drive, DoubleSpace updates its
estimates to reflect the actual current state of file compression on your drive.

Additional query words: 6.0 6.2 dblspace double space
