TITLE   :BUG: Superclassed Scroll Bar's Parent Not Sent WM_CTLCOLOR Msg
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly kbCtrl kbScrollBar kbGrpDSUser kbOSWin310 kbOSWin300

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Controls normally send WM_CTLCOLOR messages to their parents so applications can
modify the control background color. However, under Windows 3.0 and 3.1, when a
scroll bar is superclassed, its parent is not sent WM_CTLCOLOR messages.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applications that want to receive the WM_CTLCOLOR message must subclass the
scroll bar rather than superclassing its window class.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Windows versions 3.0 and 3.1.

Additional query words: scrollbar
