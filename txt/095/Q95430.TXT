TITLE   :BUG: GPF/UAE If Multi-Select Controls w/ No Common Properties
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A general protection (GP) fault or unrecoverable application error (UAE) may
occur when you select multiple custom controls that have no properties in
common.

For example, if you add the VBSQL.VBX custom control from the Microsoft SQL
Server Programmer's Toolkit for Visual Basic and then select it and the Timer
control while holding down the CTRL key, you will encounter a GP fault or UAE.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs because there are no properties in common between the Timer
control that comes with Visual Basic and the VBSQL.VBX control. This usually
isn't a problem because most custom controls contain at least the Tag property.
There are only a few exceptions.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in both the Standard and Professional
Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic versions 2.0 and 3.0 for Windows. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
