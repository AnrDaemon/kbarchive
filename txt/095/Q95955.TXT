The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft CD-ROM Extensions (MSCDEX) can control multiple CD-ROM drives. To
configure your system to do this, you must make some adjustments to the
parameters on your CD-ROM driver in the CONFIG.SYS file and to the MSCDEX
command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MSCDEX uses the /D:MSCDxxx parameter to differentiate between the drives. For
example, the following commands assign the Creative Labs CD-ROM driver
(SBPCD.SYS) to drive m and the external CD-ROM (TSLCDR.SYS) to drive n:

   CONFIG.SYS File
   ---------------
   device=c:\sbpro\sbpcd.sys /d:mscd001 /p:220
   device=c:\scsi\tslcdr.sys /d:mscd000

   AUTOEXEC.BAT File
   -----------------
  mscdex /d:mscd001 /l:m /d:mscd000 /l:n

NOTE: Because MS-DOS treats CD-ROM drives like network drives, they are assigned
sequentially to available drive letters (for example, three CD-ROM drives could
be assigned to G:, H:, and I:).
