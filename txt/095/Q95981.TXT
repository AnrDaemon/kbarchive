TITLE   :BUG: ProgMan DDE Reload() Command Does Not Work Properly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Program Manager DDE Reload() command that is new for Windows 3.1 does not
work as documented.

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to use the Reload() command in Windows version 3.1 for a particular
GroupName causes that Program Manager group to disappear. On the other hand, not
specifying any GroupName, which supposedly instructs the Program Manager to
unload all groups and reload the [Groups] section of PROGMAN.INI, causes all the
groups to disappear.

RESOLUTION
==========

After all necessary modifications have been made, the Program Manager DDE
ReplaceItem() command may be used to delete the group items that have changed;
add them back again with the AddItem() command.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Windows version 3.1. This problem is
scheduled to be corrected in the next Windows version.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DDE Reload() command documented in the Microsoft Windows version 3.1
Software Development Kit (SDK) "Programmer's Reference, Volume 1: Overview"
instructs Program Manager to remove and reload an existing group. An application
that modifies group files can use this command to cause the Program Manager to
update the groups when it has finished making modifications.
