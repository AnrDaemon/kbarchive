TITLE   :Backup Err Msg: Not Ready Error Accessing Drive x
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when you back up to a network drive
using Microsoft Backup for Windows

   Not ready error accessing drive x

where x is the letter of your network drive.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when the network generates a timeout error, due to the way
MS-DOS creates a file for the backup. Therefore, this error occurs more often
with a slow server or when you're doing a very large backup.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, either back up smaller portions of your hard disk
or increase your timeout setting for your network. If you are using Microsoft
LAN Manager version 2.1 or later, or a 100-percent LAN Manager-compatible
network, add the following statement to the [workstation] section of the
LANMAN.INI file.

   SESSTIMEOUT=180
