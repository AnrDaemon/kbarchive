SUMMARY
=======

The ExtractIcon() API is new to Windows version 3.1. The Window 3.1 Software
Development Kit (SDK) "Programmer's Reference, Volume 2: Functions" description
of this function, on page 296, does not address management of the memory
occupied by the icons extracted using ExtractIcon. This article provides that
information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When an application calls ExtractIcon(), it passes an hInstance. When that
hInstance is terminated, the memory occupied by that icon is automatically
freed.

Applications that extract several icons during their lifetime may not be able to
keep several unused icons in memory. Such applications can call DestroyIcon to
free memory occupied by icons.

If application A needs to pass a handle to an icon to application B in the
system, it should make a copy of the icon with CopyIcon() using the hInstance of
application B. This ensures that even if application A quits while application B
is still using the icon, the handle to the icon passed to application B will
still be valid.
