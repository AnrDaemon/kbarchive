SUMMARY
=======

The "Windows for Workgroups Mail User's Guide" describes how to create a
Workgroup Postoffice (WGPO) on a Novell NetWare server in Appendix B. Step 7 of
these instructions directs the user to create the WGPO by following the steps
explained in Chapter 5 of the Mail User's Guide.

The last step in Chapter 5 is to share the newly created WGPO. This step should
not be done since the post office will be on a NetWare server. If the user
attempts to share the WGPO directory on the NetWare server, the following error
message occurs:

   You can only share resources that are on your computer. If you are trying to
   share a printer, make sure that it is a local printer and that the TEMP
   directory is on a local drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sharing the NetWare postoffice is not necessary; connections to the WGPO are
made with the ServerPath= entry in the MSMAIL.INI, which reflects the
appropriate NetWare Workgroup Postoffice location.

Sharing a redirected, network drive is not possible in Windows For Workgroups.
