TITLE   :PC Win: Corrupted Address List Caused by Corrupted NETWORK.GLB
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.2,3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.2, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the Address List can appear to be
corrupted. When this occurs, no Global Address List (GAL) or Network List is
visible (only a Personal Address List is available), or only some of the Network
List is visible. The Microsoft Mail MS-DOS and Macintosh client applications are
not affected.

CAUSE
=====

The NETWORK.GLB file can cause this problem when a record lists the network name
and mailbag in incorrect locations.

RESOLUTION
==========

To verify this corruption, confirm that the size of the NETWORK.GLB file is a
multiple of 122 bytes. If it is not, use the Debug utility to repair the file
and test the address list.

If the NETWORK.GLB file is in good condition, check for possible lock on
NETWORK.GLB, GAL.NME, GALINDEX.GLB, and GALNETPO.GLB. As a last option, reboot
the server to release all locks on these files.
