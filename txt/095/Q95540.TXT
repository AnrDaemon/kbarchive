======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you choose the Install button or double-click the selected printer from the
list in the Printers dialog box of Control Panel, an hourglass appears but
nothing happens.

The following error message may be displayed when you choose the Add button:

   The information file is damaged or not in the SYSTEM directory.

   Copy the original CONTROL.INF or SETUP.INF on Windows Disk 1 to your SYSTEM
   directory, or contact your device manufacturer to get a new file.

CAUSE
=====

When you choose the Install button in the Printers dialog box of the Control
Panel with a specific driver highlighted (not the Install Unlisted or Updated
Printer option), Windows reads the SETUP.INF file and provides an Install dialog
box. (The Install Unlisted or Updated Printer selection looks for an
OEMSETUP.INF to read.)

If the SETUP.INF file has been renamed or deleted from your Windows SYSTEM
subdirectory, Windows briefly displays an hourglass when you click the Install
button; it does not display an error message or a dialog box.

If the SETUP.INF file or CONTROL.INF file is in a directory in a path other than
your Windows SYSTEM subdirectory, the error message above is displayed when you
choose the Add button.

NOTE: This error message is misleading; the CONTROL.INF file is actually located
on Disk 5 of the 3.5-inch disk set and on Disk 6 of the 5.25-inch disk set.


WORKAROUND
==========

To correct either of these problems, use one of the following methods:

 - METHOD 1:

   1. 1. Copy the SETUP.INF file from the Windows 3.1 Disk 1 to your Windows
      SYSTEM subdirectory. Copy the CONTROL.INF file from the Windows 3.1 Disk 5
      (3.5-inch disk set) or Disk 6 (5.25-inch disk set) to your Windows SYSTEM
      subdirectory. (These are not compressed files.)

   2. Restart Windows.

   3. Install the desired printer driver.

   NOTE: You should only have one copy of SETUP.INF on your system; and that copy
   should be in your Windows SYSTEM directory. Placing SETUP.INF in your root
   directory or Windows directory does not work correctly.

   -or-

 - Rebuild the WIN.INI file. For more information on re-creating the WIN.INI
   file, query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   create and win.ini and without and third-party
