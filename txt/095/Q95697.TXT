TITLE   :OTN Installation Fails Using Madge Token Ring Adapter
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

The LAN Manager over the net (OTN) installation procedure fails when using a
Madge Token-ring adapter. The following error message will be displayed during
the installation:

   The drivers for the MADGE MAC cannot be found

MORE INFORMATION
================

The OTN installation uses the "driver" entry in the template file to reference a
section in the NSETUP.INF file. In LAN Manager 2.1a, the section describing the
Madge Token Ring drivers was renamed from [MADGE] to [SMARTND]. However, the
other setup files used by the installation still refer to [MADGE].

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, rename the [SMARTND] section in the NSETUP.INF file
to [MADGE].

Additional query words: 2.10a 2.20
