TITLE   :MSCDEX Doesn't Load with Trantor CD-ROM Driver
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

MSCDEX won't load with a Trantor CD-ROM driver.

CAUSE
=====

MSCDEX can't find the Trantor CD-ROM driver TSLCDR.SYS (commonly used with
Adaptec 1542b SCSI cards) when you have a very large CONFIG.SYS file (for
example, greater than 100 lines) and you use a MS-DOS 6.0 multiple configuration
menu.

As a result, MSCDEX won't load for this device driver.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, decrease the size of the CONFIG.SYS file or don't
use a multiple configuration menu.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
