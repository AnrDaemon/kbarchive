SYMPTOMS
========

Double-clicking the System menu (sometimes called the Control menu) box of a
maximized MDI (multiple document interface) child window does not close the
child window in Microsoft Windows version 3.1.

NOTE: Windows version 3.0 does not implement closing a maximized MDI child window
by double-clicking its System menu box. For a solution to this problem, query on
the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   MDI and double-click and maximized

CAUSE
=====

In Windows version 3.1, you can close a maximized child window by double-
clicking its System menu box, but the design of this feature assumes that the
MDI client window is the first child of the MDI frame window. If the MDI frame
window has a status bar, button bar, or any other window as its first child,
double-clicking will not close the maximized child window.

RESOLUTION
==========

Create the MDI client window as the first child of the MDI frame. Create other
child windows of the MDI frame window, such as a status bar or button bar, after
creating the MDI client window; then don't change the Z-order to make it the
first child.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
