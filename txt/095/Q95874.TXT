TITLE   :WFWG: Network Applications Unable to Find NetBIOS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using Windows for Workgroups, some MS-DOS-based network applications
that check for the presence of NetBIOS may not be able to find it.

WORKAROUND
==========

To allow the application to find NetBIOS present and operate correctly, replace
the NET START line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file with the following:

   NET START NETBEUI

NOTE: This workaround may not work for all MS-DOS-based applications that check
for NetBIOS.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Some MS-DOS applications check for NetBIOS by examining the interrupt vector
table for the 0x5C entry. If the entry is the default (0 or segment F000), then
these applications assume the interrupt is not hooked and NetBIOS is not
present. Microsoft Diagnostics (MSD) is an example of such an application. It
returns NetBIOS not detected in the NETWORKS section even if the NETBEUI
protocol is running.


The protected mode transport (VNB.386), provided with Windows for Workgroups, may
not reflect a change to the interrupt vector table. Therefore, when an
MS-DOS-based application examines the vector table it may not find NetBIOS
present even when it is present. If you use the real-mode transport (for
example, by typing NET START NETBEUI at the command prompt), then the vector
table check will be successful.

Changing NET START command line to NET START NETBEUI means that the real mode
transport is used instead of the protected mode transport; the protected mode
redirector is still loaded, which leaves more memory available for MS-DOS
applications.
