SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft FoxPro for Windows comes with a spelling checker utility. To use this
utility, choose Spelling from the Text menu. If the utility doesn't work, check
the items listed below.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In order to use the spelling checker utility, the following conditions must be
met:

 - An editing window must be open, for example, a program file, memo field, or a
   text file.

 - SPELLCHK.APP must be on the system.

 - The system variable _SPELLCHK must contain the full path to the SPELLCHK.APP
   file (including the filename).

   To check the value of _SPELLCHK, type "?_SPELLCHK" (without the quotation
   marks) or "DISPLAY MEMORY" (without the quotation marks) in the Command
   window.

   If _SPELLCHK is blank, issue _SPELLCHK=" <pathname> <filename>" in
   the Command window or in the CONFIG.FPW file. For example:

   _SPELLCHK="C:\FOXPROW\SPELLCHK.APP"

 - The file FOXTOOLS.FLL must be in the FoxPro root directory.

   NOTE: In a distributed executable, FOXTOOLS.FLL must be in the same directory
   as the ESL file. Typically the Visual FoxPro ESL file is located in the
   Windows\System directory.
