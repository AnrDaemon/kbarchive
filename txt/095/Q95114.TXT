-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you quit Windows or Windows for Workgroups, if there are any minimized
applications with new, unsaved files, a dialog box asking if you would like to
"Save current changes" to the files may appear.

If you choose the Yes button, the Save As dialog box will appear in the
lower-right corner and the following problems may occur:

 - You cannot move the box with the mouse and the Move command is dimmed on the
   window's Control menu.

 - If you use the mouse to select a drive letter, the Drives box always stays on
   the working directory of the application.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the keyboard to change drives or make manual
entries, as described below. There is no way to work around the inability to
move the box. This problem occurs only when you are quitting Windows.

 - Press ALT+V to select the drives box and press the key corresponding to the
   desired drive, or use the arrow keys to scroll to that drive and then press
   ENTER.

   -or-

 - Manually type the drive and filename in the File Name box.

   <drive>:\<filename>

STATUS
======

and 3.11 and Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1 and 3.11. We are
