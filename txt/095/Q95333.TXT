Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.


Windows contains its own set of file I/O functions to perform the basic
operations such as file open, close, read, write, and so forth; however, there
is no function to copy a file. The COPY.C module included in this sample can be
plugged into any application or dynamic-link library (DLL). Some of the features
of this module are:

 - The ability to rename the output file

 - The ability to copy the file date/time stamp and attributes

 - Nondependency upon the C run time due to the use of inline assembly

 - Robust error reporting

For information on how to call the CopyFile() function, please refer to the
comment block inside of COPY.C.
