SUMMARY
=======

If you are loading the ANSI.SYS driver, MS-DOS multiple configuration colors set
with the menucolor= setting are reset to the default colors.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The menucolor= setting in the CONFIG.SYS file allows you to define your menu
colors. When ANSI.SYS is loaded through one of the menu blocks, the screen
colors are reset. This occurs because ANSI.SYS is a block device for the console
(CON). ANSI.SYS takes over all output to the console and manipulates the data in
an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) format.

ANSI.SYS turns off the menu colors because it does not detect the previous state
of the CON device.
