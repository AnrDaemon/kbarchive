TITLE   :DXMC0MOD.SYS Err Msg: Invalid Shared RAM Address
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.x,6.0,6.2,6.21,6.22

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Due to a difference in line parsing between the DEVICE and DEVICEHIGH commands
you may receive one of the following error messages when the IBM network device
driver, DXMC0MOD.SYS, loads:

   Invalid shared RAM address

   -or-

   Invalid early token ring release

After these error messages are displayed, the DXMC0MOD.SYS device driver does not
load and the network fails to start. This occurs most often after MemMaker has
been used, and DEVICE commands have been changed to DEVICEHIGH.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by the manner in which DEVICEHIGH parses command lines.
The DXMC0MOD.SYS device driver does not correctly interpret the DEVICEHIGH
parameter information.

WORKAROUND
==========

To enable your network to start and avoid these error messages, make sure enough
commas are used in the DXMC0MOD.SYS statement to act as delimiters for the three
optional parameters required by DXMC0MOD.SYS. For example, each of the following
lines cause error messages to be displayed:

   DEVICEHIGH=C:\LSP\DXMC0MOD.SYS 400000000001
   DEVICEHIGH=C:\LSP\DXMC0MOD.SYS 400000000001,D800
   DEVICEHIGH=C:\LSP\DXMC0MOD.SYS ,D800

To avoid these errors, change each line to the following:

   DEVICEHIGH=C:\LSP\DXMC0MOD.SYS 400000000001,,
   DEVICEHIGH=C:\LSP\DXMC0MOD.SYS 400000000001,D800,
   DEVICEHIGH=C:\LSP\DXMC0MOD.SYS ,D800,
