======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 2.03, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run Toshiba DOS 5.0 and Microsoft Windows 3.1 on the Toshiba T5100
laptop, you may experience the following problems:

 - The machine reboots when trying to run Windows.

 - The machine stops responding (hangs) when entering Windows.

CAUSE
=====

You are using the Windows versions of HIMEM.SYS and SMARTDRV.SYS.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Toshiba version of HIMEM.SYS and SMARTDRV.EXE have been modified for the
T5100 and other Toshiba systems and should be used in place of the Windows 3.1
versions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

According to Toshiba technical support, these problems can be corrected as
follows:

1. Use the HIMEM.SYS driver that ships with Toshiba DOS 5.0 (rather than the one
   that comes with Windows).

2. Following steps 1 through 3 in the "T5100 and Windows 3.0" section below.

T5100 and Windows 3.0
---------------------

You may receive either a

   Violated System Integrity

or

   Parity Error 2

message on a Toshiba T5100 when you run non-Windows-based applications in 386
enhanced mode of Windows 3.0. Disabling the T5100 Fast ROM option may eliminate
these messages.

To disable Fast ROM, do the following:

1. Run the file TEST3.EXE from the MS-DOS command prompt. This program is on the
   Diagnostics disk included with the T5100.

2. After running TEST3.EXE, choose zero for Setup. Select Expanded Memory, then
   use the down arrow keys to select All Extended No Expanded Memory.

3. Choose Negative for the Fast ROM option.

Using the Windows Select Feature
--------------------------------

To properly use the Select feature on the T5100 with Windows 3.0, you need to
select a 101-key keyboard. The Select feature (SHIFT+ARROW, SHIFT+HOME,
SHIFT+END, SHIFT+PGUP, SHIFT+PGDN) allows you to select large blocks of text in
Windows-based applications.

To enable this feature on a T5100, do the following:

1. Set up the machine for a 101-key keyboard by running TEST3.EXE on the Toshiba
   Diagnostics disk.

2. Choose 0 for SETUP and change the keyboard from 84 to 101 keys.

3. Exit and save the changes.

4. Install Windows and choose "Enhanced 101- or 102-key US and Non-US keyboards"
   as the keyboard type.

NOTE: If you have already installed Windows, run the Windows Setup program and
select "Enhanced 101- or 102-key US and Non-US keyboards" as the keyboard type.
