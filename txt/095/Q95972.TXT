TITLE   :PC Ext: Dispatch Cannot Spawn External with Break Options
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Dispatch tries to spawn External as an idle process and then Dispatch aborts the
idle process and reports:

   external -btxx:xx:xx terminated with exit code -1

If specified, -bt will be replaced with -bdxx-xx-xx.

CAUSE
=====

The command line for External contains break time options -bt or -bd. Dispatch
appends a break relative time to the idle process command line automatically;
thus, it cannot resolve the proper break time if -bt or -bd is already
specified.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, do not run External with a defined break time.
