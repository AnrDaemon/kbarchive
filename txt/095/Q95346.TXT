SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows for Workgroups for use with the Proteon 1390 or 1392
token-ring network interface card (NIC) and restart your system, you may receive
one of the following error messages:

   Bad PROTOCOL.INI - Drivername not found.

   The Protocol Manager has reported an incomplete binding.

These error messages may be caused by an incorrect setting in the PROTOCOL.INI
file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To make sure the Proteon settings are correct, do the following:

1. Open the PROTOCOL.INI file in a text editor such as Notepad. If the
   DRIVERNAME= setting reads as follows

         DRIVERNAME=NDISXR39$

   -or-

         DRIVERNAME=NDIS39XR$

   change it to read

   DRIVERNAME=NDI39XR$

2. If you made changes to PROTOCOL.INI, save them and restart your computer.

NOTE: If you change your network settings from Control Panel, you must edit
PROTOCOL.INI again to prevent the error from occurring.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups version
3.1.
