SUMMARY
=======

The courses used in Golf are taken from video tapes that are digitized into the
computer. Golf allows you to choose the level and tee to play at after selecting
a course. However, not all of the championship courses taped have black tees. If
you choose black tees and the course does not have them, Golf will automatically
start players at the tee farthest from the green (the blue or gold tees). Blue,
black, and gold represent the professionals' tees.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The courses currently available that have black tees are:

 - Barton Creek in Austin, Texas
