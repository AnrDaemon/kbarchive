The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for Macintosh, version 2.01 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

For a radio button, the GET clause designates a variable, <varN>, which
must be declared prior to issuing the @ ... GET command. <varN> may be a
numeric memory variable or a numeric field in a database. If the value of
<varN> is outside the range of the buttons, the first radio button on the
screen will be selected.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "Fox Report Forum" manual for version 2.01 incorrectly states under
"Defining Radio Buttons" on page 5-28 that if the value of <varN> is given
outside the range of the buttons (1 to n) then no buttons are selected until the
user selects one. To achieve this effect, the command SET VER11 ON must precede
the @ ... GET command for the radio button.

The following example illustrates the displayed default button when the numeric
value of <varN> is outside the range of the buttons. No radio button will
be displayed as selected upon execution of the program.

      ** <varN> is x in this example

      STORE 5 TO x
      SET VER11 ON
      SCREEN 1 TOP
      CLEAR
      @ 4,5 GET x PICTURE "@*R First;Second;Third"
      READ

      SET VER11 OFF
