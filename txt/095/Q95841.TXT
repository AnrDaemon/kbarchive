SUMMARY
=======

This article describes font embedding and its four levels.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Font embedding allows a user to create a document containing TrueType fonts,
open the document on another machine that does not have the font installed, and
use that font with certain limitations.

These limitations are determined by the vendor of the font and are built into the
font. Although this technology is built into the font, some users may not be
able to use the font because the application must support the ability to embed
the fonts when the document is saved.

There are four levels of embedding:

1. None - This level of embedding does not allow for embedding. Another font is
   substituted for the selected font.

2. Preview & Print - This level of embedding allows the selected font to be
   seen on the screen and printed from the document in which the font was
   embedded.

3. Editable - At this level, the selected font can be seen on screen, printed,
   and edited (but only in the host document).

4. Installable - This level includes attributes of all previous levels. The
   selected fonts can be installed on the computer and used in other documents
   and applications.
