======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Microsoft Font Assistant version 1.0 or 1.01 (included with
the TrueType Font Pack 2), you may receive the following error message

   Font Assistant Program Startup Failed, Aborting

and the program will quit.

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs if the FAST.INI file contains a syntax error or
incorrect information.

The FAST.INI file contains the font database used by the Font Assistant to manage
TrueType fonts. If this file contains a syntax error or is corrupt, the above
error message will be displayed and the Font Assistant will not run.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, rename the FAST.INI file from the MS-DOS prompt as
follows:

   REN C:\Windows\FAST.INI FAST.INO

When you restart the Font Assistant, the program will scan the WIN.INI file for
installed TrueType fonts and will recreate the FAST.INI file. You will have to
recreate custom font groups.

For more information on valid FAST.INI entries, query on the following words in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   fast.ini and font and assistant and groups and fonts and pref
