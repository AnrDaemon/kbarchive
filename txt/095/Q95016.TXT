TITLE   :PROFS: "System Abend 155" Installing Gateway on Host
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::2.1b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to PROFS, version 2.1b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to install the Microsoft Mail Gateway to PROFS on the MS-Gate VM ID
on the host system fails immediately after you initiate the install command.
When this error occurs, VM generates the following error message:

   Generating National Language Support. DMS Abend 148T system abend 155 called
   from 3020628 reason code 0000000

CAUSE
=====

The abend 155 error has three major causes:

 - The PROFS gateway VM ID is not properly linked to the system disk that
   contains the VM Assembler. The assembler is required to process commands in
   several PROREXX modules used by the install program.

 - An assembler other than the IBM VM assembler is installed on the system. The
   alternative assembler causes an incompatibility conflict with the IBM CONVERT
   command in the PROREXX module of the INSTALL EXEC.

 - The version of the VM operating system installed on the computer is not
   compatible with the IBM CONVERT command in the PROREXX module of the INSTALL
   EXEC.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the first cause of this error, the VM administrator must give the
MS-Gate ID access to the VM system disk that contains the assembler.

To resolve the second cause of this error, the VM administrator must install the
IBM VM assembler and give the MS-Gate ID access to it.

To resolve the third cause of this error, replace the IBM CONVERT command line in
the PROREXX module of the INSTALL EXEC with the following line:

   GENCMD PROREXX ( USER OUTMODE F )
