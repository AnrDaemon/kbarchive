The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6, 2.6a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5x, 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft FoxPro for Windows and Macintosh, the SET BELL command can be used
to assign a sound file in waveform (.WAV) format to be activated instead of the
default bell.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using the SET BELL Command in FoxPro for Windows
------------------------------------------------

The following commands assign the waveform file CHIMES.WAV to the FoxPro bell and
play that sound:

      SET BELL TO "CHIMES.WAV", 1
      ? CHR(7)

NOTE: 1, the second parameter of the SET BELL command, has no effect when the
bell is set to a waveform file; however, a numeric value must still be passed as
the second parameter.

The above SET BELL command will cause a syntax error in Microsoft FoxPro version
2.5 for MS-DOS because this functionality is not currently available in the
MS-DOS version of FoxPro.

To play a waveform file, an appropriate sound driver must be installed in the
Windows Control Panel by using the Drivers icon. For more information on
installing sound drivers, see the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."

NOTE: Setting the bell to a .WAV file on a machine without a sound driver does
not give an error, but it will not work and the bell won't reset properly after
issuing "SET BELL TO <freq>,<duration>" (without the quotation
marks).

Using the SET BELL Command in FoxPro for Macintosh
--------------------------------------------------

The following commands assign the different waveform files to the FoxPro bell and
play the sounds:

      SET BELL TO "quack",0
      ?? CHR(7)

      SET BELL TO "droplet",0
      ?? CHR(7)

Any sound whose name appears in the Sound Control Panel can be used as the FoxPro
bell, including sounds that you record. Just use the name that appears for the
sound in the Sound Control Panel in the SET BELL TO command.
