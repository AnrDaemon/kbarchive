TITLE   :WFWG: Network Card Detection Hangs Machine During Setup

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you disable hardware detection during Windows for Workgroups Setup because
network card detection (NCD) has made your machine stop responding (hang), Setup
doesn't perform any hard disk drive and video adapter detection either. This
results in 32-bit disk access support not being installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft recommends that you not use the /I switch to avoid NCD because Windows
for Workgroups automatically skips NCD the second time you run Setup if it
failed before. The following line is added to the [boot] section of the
SYSTEM.INI file before NCD takes place:

        ignore_hw_detect=true

If this switch is present in the SYSTEM.INI file, Setup skips NCD, but continues
to check your hard disk drive and video adapter.

NOTE: If you run Setup a second time and your computer hangs again, use the /I
switch.
