The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message may be displayed when you start your computer after
installing support for Banyan Vines connectivity:

   Cannot install protected mode mapping

This error message is displayed when WFWNET.DRV cannot load VINES.DRV.

CAUSE
=====

This error message may be caused by a lack of available conventional memory.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, try to increase the amount of free conventional
memory. (In one case, 390 kilobytes of free conventional memory was needed.)

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error message occurs in low memory situations when the VINES
protect-to-real mapping code fails to get a low memory buffer that is needed for
interrupts that pass a buffer of data. The default value is for the mapping
device load library (DLL) to get one 16K buffer. You can change this by setting
the following values in the VINES.INI file:

[communications]
 bufsize=16384   ;size of mapping buffer
 buffers=1       ;number of buffers to get
