SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the differences between Windows for Workgroups Mail and
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Workgroup postoffice architecture is similar to the architecture for
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.0. This is so users with connectivity
needs beyond their workgroup can easily upgrade.

The postoffice structure and Windows client are identical except for the
following:

 - No Demo files are in the workgroup postoffice. Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
   does include these files.

 - There is no spell checker with Windows for Workgroups Mail. The spell checker
   is supplied with Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.

 - The postoffice in Windows for Workgroups does not support connections to
   external postoffices or gateways. For example, a Windows for Workgroups
   postoffice cannot connect to another postoffice or gateway.

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks includes support for global aliases or network
   group names while Windows for Workgroups Mail does not.

 - The default ADMIN.TPL and ADMIN.INF files in Windows for Workgroups Mail are
   created with predefined user information in the workgroup postoffice. For
   example, the user templates included in Windows for Workgroups Mail contain
   template information regarding Phone number #1, Phone number #2, Office,
   Department, and Notes. These must be created separately in Microsoft Mail for
   PC Networks.

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks includes an administration program not created
   in Windows for Workgroups Mail. In Windows for Workgroups, the administration
   program is accessed via the Mail menu in the Windows Mail client.

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks includes an administration utility that is
   used to administer and configure the postoffice. The ADMIN.EXE program can be
   used to configure and administer the postoffice from any workstation on the
   network running MS-DOS. In Windows for Workgroups, the administration program
   is accessed via the Mail menu in the Windows Mail client. Only the
   administrator can log on under his or her account and administer the
   postoffice on the workstation only.

 - The Mail client included with Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
   is designed to work with Microsoft At Work PC Fax. However, At Work Fax is
   not supported with version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows.
