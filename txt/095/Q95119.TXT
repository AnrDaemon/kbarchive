The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WindowMagic is a Windows utility that allows icons to be easily
assigned to any of the Program Manager's Groups or application icons.
When using the WindowMagic application version 1.0b with Windows for
Workgroups, application icons may not be able to change.

When WindowMagic loads, it expects Program Manager to be the first
application to be loaded. With Windows for Workgroups, the Clipboard
Server (CLIPSRV.EXE) and NetDDE (NETDDE.EXE) applications load before
Program Manager, which prevents WindowMagic from assigning the icons.

For additional information, contact WinWear Corporation.

WindowMagic is manufactured by WinWear, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
products' performance or reliability.
