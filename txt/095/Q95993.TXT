SUMMARY
=======

According to Tiara technical support, the TNDIS driver has not been tested with
any of the Lancard E/16PC TP (lattice net based) network interface cards
(NICs).

The Lancard E/16PC TP has a PWA number on the card. If the last six digits are in
the range 000000 to 000004, it is a lattice net based card and incompatible with
Windows for Workgroups.

If you try to use this card with Windows for Workgroups, you may be unable to see
or use other workstations, but no error messages appear.
