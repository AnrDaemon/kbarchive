SUMMARY
=======

The built-in Backlight screen feature on Leading Edge Laptop computers with
Phoenix BIOS causes the display to dim when Windows is running. The screen
cannot be restored without running MS-DOS Prompt or exiting Windows and pressing
any key.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some Leading Edge Laptop computers have a Backlight screen feature built into
the Phoenix BIOS. The screen feature acts like a screen saver and is designed to
clear the screen after a specific amount of idle time.

Under Windows, the screen saver does not clear the screen; instead, the contrast
dims. Windows can still be faintly seen. The only way to restore the screen is
to exit Windows or run MS-DOS Prompt and press any key. This happens in all
modes of Windows.

The only way to disable the screen saver is through CMOS Setup. On the Leading
Edge machine the feature is called Backlight Duration. The duration can be set
from 1 to 30 minutes or to Forever. The Forever setting disables the Backlight
screen saver feature.

The Leading Edge product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
