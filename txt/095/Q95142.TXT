TITLE   :Setting System Attribute on SYSTEM.INI Causes GP Fault
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the SYSTEM.INI file is assigned the System attribute, you receive the
following error message:

   Application Error
   WINFILE Caused a General Protection Fault
   in module WINFILE.EXE at XXXX:XXXX

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this error, remove the system attribute from the SYSTEM.INI file by
typing the following command at an MS-DOS prompt in the WINDOWS directory:

   ATTRIB -S SYSTEM.INI

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the SYSTEM.INI file has been altered in the above manner, the File Manager
may work intermittently. At times, the directory tree displays just the root
directory with no subdirectories. At other times, no file names will appear or
file details will appear, preceded by the system/hidden file icon (a red
exclamation point on the file icon).

To display the current attributes of the SYSTEM.INI file:

1. Switch to the WINDOWS directory.

2. Type the following command at the MS-DOS prompt:

   ATTRIB <SPACE> SYSTEM.INI

   press ENTER

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows and Windows
for Workgroups. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
