SUMMARY
=======

You cannot use the MS-DOS 6 Upgrade Uninstall disk to restore your previous
version of MS-DOS if you have compressed any of your hard disk drives with
DoubleSpace or a third-party disk-compression program unless you remove all
traces of the disk-compression software.


If you attempt to restore your previous version of MS-DOS and you have compressed
your hard disk drive with DoubleSpace, you receive the following error:

   Because you installed DoubleSpace after installing MS-DOS 6, you cannot
   restore your previous version of DOS.

For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.
