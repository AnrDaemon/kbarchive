TITLE   :MemMaker Does Not Preserve Redirection or Trailing Spaces
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.21,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

MemMaker does not preserve redirection syntax and trailing spaces in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file. For example, if you have C:\DOS\DOSKEY >NUL in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file, MemMaker changes it to LH /L:x,nnnn C:\DOS\DOSKEY. If you
have "set prompt=[$p] " (without the quotation marks) in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file,
MemMaker removes the trailing space and changes it to "set prompt=[$p]".

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and put the >NUL
statement and/or trailing spaces back in after you run MemMaker.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS versions 6.0, 6.2, and
6.21. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 6.22 6.00 6.20
