SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Z-Nix SuperMouse and SuperTracker control panel, you may receive
the following message when trying to load the Windows 3.1 Control Panel:

   Cannot Find STRAKCP.DLL

After choosing OK, the following message appears:

   Cannot Load STRAK.DRV

To solve this problem, copy the STRAKCP.DLL file from the Mouse directory to your
Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Z-Nix SuperMouse has a Windows utility called SuperTrack. This is a separate
mouse control panel that controls acceleration and sensitivity for the Z-Nix
mouse. This utility is similar to the POINTER.EXE used with the Microsoft Mouse
driver version 8.2.

If not setup correctly, the files are placed into the Mouse subdirectory rather
than your Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.
