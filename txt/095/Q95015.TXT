======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 2.1b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While transferring messages between the LAN and VM host environments, the system
displays the following error message:

   Error in downloading the file xxx Lines downloaded instead of yyy

This error message signals that the VMGATE program's check of the downloaded file
size was inconsistent with the file size it had when it was located on the VM
host.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by a set of bad file transfer executables (SEND.EXE and
RECEIVE.EXE) from the emulator manufacturer.

RESOLUTION
==========

For assistance in acquiring corrected versions of the transfer executables,
check with the manufacturer of the emulator.
