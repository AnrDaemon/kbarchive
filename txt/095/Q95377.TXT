SUMMARY
=======

An @ ... GET-List command from a Prompt Files popup does not display the drive
popup in the font specified by the FONT clause.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On page L3-75 of the "Language Reference" manual, the Font section of the @ ...
GET-List command mentions that a font can be specified for a list. The list
itself will be displayed in the font specified, but the drive popup (which is
displayed by selecting the first option in the list) will not be displayed in
the specified font.

The following code demonstrates this behavior:

      CLEAR
      SET TALK OFF
      STORE 1 TO mchoice

      DEFINE POPUP scrollopts FROM 0, 0 PROMPT FILES LIKE *.DBF MARGIN ;
      SCROLL

      @ 2,2 GET mchoice POPUP scrollopts SIZE 8, 20 font "ROMAN",16

      READ && Activate the list.

The font used for the drive popup cannot be specified because it is a "true"
popup (that is, a popup created with the DEFINE POPUP command). True popups use
whatever font is specified as the Windows system font.

The Windows system font is the font used in title bars and menu bars for all
applications running under Windows. For more information about the Windows
system font, please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
