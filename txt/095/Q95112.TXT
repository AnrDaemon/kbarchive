TITLE   :NIC at I/O Port of 0360h May Prevent Local Printing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the Network Interface Card (NIC) used with Windows for Workgroups (WFWG) is
set to use an I/O Port address of 0360h, Windows may be unable to print locally.
Also, this setting may cause lost network connections after a print job is sent
to the local parallel port or the server may lock up when a job is printed from
another workstation.

CAUSE
=====

Parallel port LPT1 normally uses an I/O Port address of 0378h. Some network
cards (especially NE2000 compatibles) use 20 address segments; this places the
top of their address space at I/O Port address 0379h. So if a network card is
set to an I/O Port address of 0360h, there may be a hardware conflict with the
printer's I/O Port address.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, set the network card to an I/O Port address of
0340h or lower. For more information on changing this setting on a network card,
consult the user's manual for the card.
