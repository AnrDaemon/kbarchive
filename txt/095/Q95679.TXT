-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

On page U3-9 of the "User's Guide," the last bulleted item of the Select All
section incorrectly suggests that FoxPro selects the OLE object in the general
field window if a general field window is the active window and Select All is
chosen from the Edit menu.

When a general field window is the active window, the Select All command on the
Edit menu is unavailable.

Additional query words: VFoxWin FoxWin 2.50 grey disabled grayed out dimmed docerr
