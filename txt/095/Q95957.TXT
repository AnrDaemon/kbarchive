SYMPTOMS

When you use QuarterDeck's Qemm extended memory manager with Windows in 386
enhanced mode, Windows may generate the following error message when you run
Intel's Faxability Plus for Windows:

   File server encountered a critical error and terminated.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, disable the Stealth Mapping feature in Qemm. For
information about how to do this, see your Qemm manual.

MORE INFORMATION
