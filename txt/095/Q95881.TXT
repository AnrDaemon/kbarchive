-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A Windows for Workgroups (WFWG) machine or server name will be visible on a
Windows for Workgroups network only when the Enable Sharing option is selected
in the Network Settings dialog box (choose the Network icon in the Control Panel
window).

If the Enable Sharing option is not selected, other machines will not be able to
view that machine on a browse list and the machine will not be able to see
itself in a browse list. This situation applies to all Windows for Workgroups
functions that display lists of Windows for Workgroups machines (such as Chat,
Hearts, File Manager, Print Manager) and any application or utility that has a
Network button.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This applies only to machines that have have the specifications to be Windows
for Workgroups servers (that is, they can be run in 386 enhanced mode and have
at least 3 megabytes [MB] of RAM). A 286 machine or a machine running in
standard mode is not capable of sharing resources and the Enable Sharing option
will be unavailable (dimmed).
