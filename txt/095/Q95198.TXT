======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft C/C++ for MS-DOS, version 7.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, 16-bit edition, versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.51, 1.52 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to compile an application that changes the definition of the "new"
operator to DEBUG_NEW fails and the compiler generates the following message:

   error C2061: syntax error : identifier 'p'

CAUSE
=====

The statement "#define new DEBUG_NEW" precedes an IMPLEMENT_SERIAL or an
IMPLEMENT_DYNACREATE macro call.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the source code to place the DEBUG_NEW definition after all statements
that call the IMPLEMENT_SERIAL or IMPLEMENT_DYNCREATE macros. For more
information, see Chapter 15 of the Microsoft Visual C++ "Class Library User's
Guide."

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior has changed for Visual C++ version 4.0. However, if you build an
application that makes use of DEBUG_NEW with Visual C++ 4.0, and then attempt to
build that application in Visual C++ version 2.x, you will need to move the
#define DEBUG_NEW as discussed above.
