SYMPTOMS
========

The network setup program included with Aldus applications, such as PageMaker
4.0, may not operate correctly with Windows for Workgroups in enhanced mode
using the virtual redirector.

If the Aldus network setup program is used with Windows for Workgroups in
enhanced mode and it installs without error messages, but there may be file
corruption and the Aldus application may not run or may cause other Windows
errors.

WORKAROUND
==========

 - Start the real mode redirector by typing "NET START WORKSTATION" (without the
   quotation marks) at the command prompt before starting Windows for
   Workgroups.

   -or-

 - Run setup for the Aldus application from the original floppy disks.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups version
3.1. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
