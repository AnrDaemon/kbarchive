The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In the Chat application included with Windows for Workgroups, incorrect screen
fonts or "boxes" may appear in the remote computer's conversation display box.
This problem may be caused by enabling the Use Partner's Font option, even
though the partner's screen font is not available on the machine.

To work around this problem, use a font that is available on both machines or do
not select the Use Partner's Font option.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you choose the Preferences command from the Options menu of the Chat
application, there is an option to use the partner's screen font. This option
can be set to either use the user's own font, or to use the partner's font. If a
user selects Use Partner's Font and does not have that font loaded on his or her
system, Windows for Workgroups may incorrectly display the incoming characters.
When using a TrueType font, the characters may appear as incorrect characters or
as boxes.
