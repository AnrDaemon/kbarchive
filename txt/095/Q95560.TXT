TITLE   :MemMaker Converts Some Variables to Drive Letters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set an environment variable in the Autoexec.bat file and then use it to
run a program, MemMaker converts the environment variable to its true name.

For example, if your Autoexec.bat file contains these lines before you run
MemMaker:

   set xdrive=d
   %xdrive%:\dos\doskey

they are converted to:

   set xdrive=d
   lh /l:xxxx  d:\dos\doskey

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, either do not set environment variables to drive
letters or directories, or modify your Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files after
you run MemMaker.
