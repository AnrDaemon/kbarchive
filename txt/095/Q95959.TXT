The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Intersvr resets the screen to 25-line mode and may not display information on
the lower part of the screen when you are loading XANSI.SYS and using an Orchid
ProDesigner IIs in 80-characters-per line/60-lines-per-screen mode. There is no
work around at this time.

This problem does not occur with ANSI.SYS and MODE.COM when they are used with
the video modes they support.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information on MODE and video support, type the following at the MS-DOS
command prompt and press ENTER:

   " help mode (set display mode)" (without the quotation marks)
