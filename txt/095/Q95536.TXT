SUMMARY
=======

The DBLSPACE /CHKDSK command evaluates errors and then sorts them into three
categories: lost clusters, cross-linked files, and other.

The "other" category indicates one or more of the following problems:

 - There is a damaged extended BIOS parameter block (BPB). (This is the BPB
   specific to the compressed volume file [CVF].)

 - There is a damaged beginning or ending signature in the CVF.

 - An entry in the MD-FAT (Microsoft DoubleSpace - file allocation table) is
   corrupt (unreadable).

 - The MD-FAT makes a reference to the MS-DOS FAT that is not valid.

 - The sector heap offset is out of range; for example, the sector heap is
   larger than the CVF or beyond the size of the logical compressed drive.

NOTE: The DBLSPACE /CHKDSK command will repair, or attempt to repair, the "other"
error.

Additional query words: 6.0 double space cross link crosslink
