======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when you try to convert a Stacker
volume to a DoubleSpace volume:

   DoubleSpace cannot convert your Stacker drives because they have a cluster
   size other than 8K. To convert your Stacker drives to DoubleSpace format,
   follow the instructions in the DoubleSpace section of the README.TXT file.

CAUSE
=====

When you convert a Stacker volume to a DoubleSpace volume, your Stacker
compressed volume file (CVF) must have 8K clusters. If it does not, you receive
the error message.

When you install Stacker version 2.0 or 3.0, you have the option of using cluster
sizes other than the 8K default.

 - Stacker 2.0 supports 4K and 8K clusters

 - Stacker 3.0 supports 4K, 8K, 16K, and 32K clusters

Since the conversion of a Stacker volume is done cluster by cluster, and
DoubleSpace uses 8K clusters, DoubleSpace cannot convert Stacker volumes if they
don't have 8K clusters.

NOTE: This error occurs regardless of the Stacker volume file cluster size if the
Stacker volume file has never been mounted.
