-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows versions 1991 edition, 1992 edition, 1993 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Some copied pronunciations from the Dictionary in Bookshelf may paste
incorrectly into a document.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The copied text (pronunciation) is rendered as text in the Clipboard. When
pasted into a word processor (for example, Word for Windows or Works for
Windows) some characters appear as nonprintable characters instead of the
symbols represented in Bookshelf.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

When you do the following, you expect phonetic characters; however, you receive
different characters:

1. Start the Dictionary.

2. Select a word.

3. From the Edit menu, select Copy.

4. Note the pronunciations are not the same.

5. Select the text.

6. From the Edit menu, select Copy.

7. Open a word processor.

8. From the Edit menu, select Paste.

Note: The Paste Special option in the Edit menu lists text as the only choice.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
