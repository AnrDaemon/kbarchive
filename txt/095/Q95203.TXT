======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you used SMARTDrive Monitor (SmartMon) to change SMARTDrive's cache settings,
you may receive the following error message after exiting SmartMon:

   SmartMon is unable to save the new cache settings in the specified batch
   file.

CAUSE
=====

This error message is displayed when SmartMon is unable to find the SMARTDrive
command line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. This may be due to the fact that SmartMon
does not recognize the LH command and /L switch when they are used together. For
example, SmartMon cannot modify the following line:

   lh c:\dos\smartdrv.exe /l

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the cache settings by manually editing the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SmartMon version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.
