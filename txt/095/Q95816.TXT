======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Although the text in this article specifically refers to MS-DOS 6.2
DoubleSpace, the information also applies to MS-DOS 6.22 DriveSpace. If you
have MS-DOS 6.22, substitute DRVSPACE for any DBLSPACE commands.

SUMMARY
=======

During installation, DoubleSpace may add the statement
DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\DBLSPACE.SYS /MOVE to the CONFIG.SYS file more than once.
DoubleSpace adds this line to more than one location in the CONFIG.SYS file if
DoubleSpace determines that DBLSPACE.BIN may cause problems for network device
drivers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DBLSPACE.SYS /MOVE does not load a device driver for DoubleSpace. Instead, it
moves the DoubleSpace component (DBLSPACE.BIN) into memory. Multiple instances
of DBLSPACE.SYS do not use additional memory because this device driver simply
moves DBLSPACE.BIN and then unloads itself.

Additional query words: 6.00 dblspace double space 6.20
