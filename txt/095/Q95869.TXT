======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Test button may be unavailable (dimmed) if you choose the Drivers icon from
the Control Panel window, select Wave Driver For PC Speaker, and choose the
Setup button.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur when the [Sounds] section in the WIN.INI file does not
contain any information.

Below is the default sample [Sounds] section from the Windows for Workgroups
WIN.INI file. Windows 3.1 will not have "RingIn" or "RingOut" sounds.

      [Sounds]
      SystemDefault=ding.wav, Default Beep
      SystemExclamation=ding.wav, Exclamation
      SystemStart=chimes.wav, Windows Start
      SystemExit=chimes.wav, Windows Exit
      SystemHand=ding.wav, Critical Stop
      SystemQuestion=ding.wav, Question
      SystemAsterisk=ding.wav, Asterisk
      RingIn=ringin.wav, Incoming Call
      RingOut=ringout.wav, Outgoing Call

To enable the Test button, add the [Sounds] section to the WIN.INI file, along
with the desired system events. An original copy of this section can be pasted
from the WIN.SR_ file that is on Disk 1 of the Windows 3.1 disks and Disk 3 of
the Windows for Workgroups disks.

To correct the WIN.INI file:

Before beginning the following steps, make a backup copy of your current WIN.INI
file. For instructions on how to do this, consult your MS-DOS manual.

1. Expand WIN.SR_ into the Windows directory and rename it to WIN.SRC. For
   information about expanding files, see your MS-DOS manual.

2. Run Notepad and open WIN.SRC by choosing Open from the File menu and
   selecting WIN.SRC. Choose the OK button.

3. Select the entire [Sounds] section.

4. From the Edit menu, choose Copy.

5. From the File menu, choose Open and select WIN.INI. Choose the OK Button.

6. Paste the [Sounds] section to the end of the WIN.INI file by choosing Paste
   from the Edit menu.

7. Save the WIN.INI file and restart Windows.

   NOTE: You can delete WIN.SRC from the WINDOWS directory after you have
   completed the above steps.
