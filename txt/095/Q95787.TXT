SUMMARY
=======

Smartcan is an erase protection utility included with version 2.0 of Norton
Desktop for Windows (NDW). Smartcan hides deleted files in a hidden directory,
allowing them to be easily unerased.

If you use the utility while the SHARE.EXE terminate-and-stay-resident program
(TSR) is loaded, it causes frequent sharing violation messages and can cause
data corruption.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The purpose of SHARE.EXE is to provide file sharing and locking capabilities for
files on your hard disk. When SHARE.EXE is loaded, it is responsible for
validating all file operation requests by applications.

In Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1, SHARE is loaded as a virtual
device driver (VSHARE.386) in the SYSTEM.INI file. According to Symantec
Technical Support, both the Windows and Windows for Workgroups implementations
of SHARE.EXE conflict with Norton's Smartcan.

Norton Desktop for Windows and Norton Smartcan are manufactured by Symantec, a
vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
