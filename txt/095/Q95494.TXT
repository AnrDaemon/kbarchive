TITLE   :DoubleSpace Err Msg: 'Not Enough Conventional Memory...'

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you start your computer using the interactive startup option in order to free
enough memory to run the DoubleSpace Stacker conversion option, you may receive
the following error message after DoubleSpace restarts your computer:

   Not enough conventional memory

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you start your computer and press the F8, F5, or SHIFT key to free enough
conventional memory to run the DoubleSpace Stacker converter, you must also use
the interactive startup option when DoubleSpace restarts your computer. If you
do not use this option, you will not have enough memory to complete the
conversion.

If you use the F5 key to bypass the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files, the only
directory in the PATH environment variable is C:\DOS; therefore, DoubleSpace
cannot start Stacker.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this situation, either use the F8 key to bypass some of your
device drives before and during the Stacker conversion process, or remark out
(REM) some of the device drivers and terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs
in your CONFIG.SYS file.
