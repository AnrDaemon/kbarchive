KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

At times, Print Services for Macintosh does not work. Event ID 2019 and Event ID
4011 error messages from True Image may be displayed as well.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by sending PostScript level-two print jobs to Printer
Control Language (PCL) print queues from Macintosh clients.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, send only PostScript level-one or PCL print jobs from
Macintosh clients to PCL print queues.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0,
Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Packs 1, 2, 3, and 4 as well as Windows NT Server,
Enterprise Edition version 4.0 and 4.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The print services for Macintosh uses True Image to convert Post Script print
jobs to PCL when the print jobs are sent to PCL print queues. Windows NT is only
designed to convert Post Script level one print jobs. Post Script level two
print jobs may be sent to Post Script print queues without any problem because
the computer running Windows NT Server passes the Post Script job straight to
the printer without altering it.
