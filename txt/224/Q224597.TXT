TITLE   :XCON: SP2 of PROFS Connector Sets Sent Date to Jan 1, 1601
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After upgrading an Exchange Server computer to version 5.5 Service Pack 2 (SP2),
messages received from a SoftSwitch environment may display a sent date as
1/1/01. If your client is configured to display a 4-digit year, you will see
1/1/1601.

If you examine the message with MDBVU, you will see a date of Jan 1, 1601. Note
that this is the base time for the FILETIME format.

CAUSE
=====

A logic change introduced in Exchange Server 5.5 SP2 can leave the date
uninitialized. When the uninitialized SYSTEMTIME structure is passed to the
LocalFileTimeToFileTime() function, the result is Jan 1, 1601.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
