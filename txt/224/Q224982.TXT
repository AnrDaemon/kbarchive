TITLE   :Err: STOP 0x0000001e {0xc000005, 0xa1000aa7, 0x0, 0x00440194}
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0,4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the value of the process ID (PID) of any given process exceeds 65,535 or
0x10000, Win32k.sys generates the following error message on a blue screen:

   STOP 0x0000001e {0xc000005, 0xa1000aa7, 0x00000000, 0x00440194}

NOTE: The first parameter will always be 0xc0000005 and the second parameter will
always fall within the memory range of Win32k.sys.

CAUSE
=====

When a process terminates, Win32k.sys must release structures allocated by that
process. Win32k.sys tracks these structures by PID number. The driver Win32k.sys
only supports PID numbers within the 0-65,535 range (ushort).

This problem occurs because a program is not releasing thread handles. When a
thread is created, a handle is allocated out of the system handle table as well
as the process handle table. This system handle table is the same handle table
process IDs come from. This can cause the value of the process ID numbers to
exceed 65,535 or 0x10000.


RESOLUTION
==========

listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you install the hotfix, if you attempt to create a process with an ID
value greater than 65,535, the following pop-up error message is displayed and
the process create does not work:

   Initialization of the dynamic link library USER32.DLL failed. The process is
   terminating abnormally.

To find the process that is not releasing thread handles, use Performance Monitor
to find a process with a high handle count.
