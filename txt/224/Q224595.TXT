TITLE   :DCOM Client Cannot Establish CIS Session Using TCP/IP Address
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Cluster Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Microsoft Component Object Model (COM) Internet Services (CIS)
on a computer running Windows NT that is configured with multiple network
adapters or with Microsoft Cluster Server, the computer cannot establish a
communications link to another computer configured as a Component Object Model
server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, configure the Distributed Component Object Model
(DCOM) client to use the cluster server's computer name instead of the TCP/IP
address when attempting to establish a communications session between the two
computers.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
