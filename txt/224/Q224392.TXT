TITLE   :Error Message: The System Call Level Is Not Correct
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95; winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to send a message using Server Manager to a user logged on to a
computer running Windows 95 or Windows 98, you may receive the following error
message:

   The system call level is not correct.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because Windows 95 and Windows 98 do not support this type
of connection.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the NET SEND command to send messages from a Windows NT server to users
logged on to computers running Windows 95 or Windows 98. To receive this type of
message, the computer running Windows 95 or Windows 98 must be running the
WinPopup tool. For a computer running Windows NT to receive messages, the
Messenger service must be running. By default, the Messenger service is
configured to start automatically.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you send a message using Server Manager, the sending computer attempts to
establish a secure connection using Server Side Named Pipes functionality. The
receiving computer then sends a broadcast of the message to all connected users.
Computers running Windows 95 and Windows 98 do not support Server Side Named
Pipes functionality.

The NET SEND command uses Client Side Named Pipes functionality, which is
supported by Windows 95 and Windows 98.
