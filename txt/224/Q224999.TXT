SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to restore the Clusdb file using a .tmp file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the Clusdb file is damaged you may be able to restore this file using a .tmp
file in the cluster hive.


The Clusdb file is the registry used for Microsoft Cluster Server and is
reproduced on both nodes when you are using cluster server. Cluster Server
creates a copy of the Clusdb file named Chk<xxx>.tmp located in the Mscs
folder on the shared disk where the quorum information is.

How to Restore the Clusdb File From the Chk<xxx>.tmp File on Both Nodes
---------------------------------------------------------------------

To restore the Clusdb file from the Chk<xxx>.tmp file on both nodes in the
cluster, use the following steps:

1. On both nodes, change the Startup value to Manual for the following items:

   Clusdisk (in the Devices tool in Control Panel)
   Cluster Service (in the Services tool in Control Panel)

2. Shut down node 2.

3. Restart node 1.

4. Copy the Chk<xxx>.tmp file with the most recent time and date stamp
   from the \Mscs folder on the shared quorum drive to a disk and to the local
   %SystemRoot%\Cluster folder.

5. Rename the Clusdb file in the %SystemRoot%\Cluster folder to Clusdb.old.

6. Rename the Chk<xxx>.tmp file in the %SystemRoot%\Cluster folder to
   Clusdb.

7. Change the Startup value back to the following settings:

   System for Clusdisk (in the Devices tool in Control Panel)
   Automatic for the Cluster service (in the Services tool in Control Panel)

8. Restart node 1.

9. Verify that the Cluster service starts correctly after you restart the node.

10. Start node 2.

11. On node 2, copy the Chk<xxx>.tmp file from the disk to the
   %SystemRoot%\Cluster folder.

12. Rename the Clusdb file in the %SystemRoot%\Cluster folder to Clusdb.old.

13. Rename the Chk<xxx>.tmp file in the %SystemRoot%\Cluster folder to
   Clusdb.

14. Change the Startup value back to the following settings:

   System for Clusdisk (in the Devices tool in Control Panel)
   Automatic for the Cluster service (in the Services tool in Control Panel)

15. Restart node 2.

16. Verify that the Cluster service starts correctly after you restart the node
   and that you can failover resources.

How to Restore the Clusdb File From the Chk<xxx>.tmp File on Only One Node
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To restore the Clusdb file from the Chk<xxx>.tmp file on only one node, use
the following steps:

1. Using the Services tool in Control Panel, set the Cluster service to Manual
   on the node where the service does not start.

2. Restart the node.

3. From the correctly functioning node, copy the Chk<xxx>.tmp file with
   the most recent time and date stamp from the Mscs folder on the shared quorum
   drive to a disk.

4. On the non-functioning node, rename the Clusdb file in the
   %SystemRoot%\Cluster folder.

5. Copy the Chk<xxx>.tmp file from the disk to the %SystemRoot%\Cluster
   folder.

6. Rename the Chk<xxx>.tmp file in the %SystemRoot%\Cluster folder to
   Clusdb.

7. Using the Services tool in Control Panel, start the Cluster service.

8. Verify that the service starts correctly and that you can failover resources.

9. Set the Cluster service back to Automatic using the Services tool in Control
   Panel.
