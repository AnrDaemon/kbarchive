TITLE   :Performance Monitor Counters Do Not Start from a Shared Bus
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using a Microsoft Cluster Server environment, the Windows NT
Performance Monitor counters do not start from a shared bus in the event of a
failover.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs if more than one Cluster Server node tries to gain accesss to
the shared disk at the same time.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, install all Performance Monitor dynamic-link libraries
(DLLs) must be installed locally in the system path on each Cluster Server node.
You must change the Performance Monitor registry keys to reflect the new
location of the Performance Monitor DLLs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you try to run Performance Monitor extensible counters on more than one
node in a Cluster Server environment, the DLLs are stored on the shared drive.
Only one Cluster Server node can access the shared drive at a time. Performance
Monitor loads the base Performance Monitor DLLs and third-party extensible DLLs
when Perfmon.exe starts.
