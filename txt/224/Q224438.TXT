PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The following Performance Monitor counters associated with the MSExchangeIS
object may not be updated properly for Internet Message Access Protocol version
4 (IMAP4), Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3), or Network News Transfer
Protocol (NNTP) connections:

 - Active Anonymous User Count
 - Active Connection Count
 - Active User Count

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Information Store

+-------------------------+
| File name  | Version    | 
+-------------------------+
| Gapi32.dll | 5.5.2544.0 | 
+-------------------------+
| Mdbmsg.dll | 5.5.2544.0 | 
+-------------------------+
| Store.exe  | 5.5.2544.0 | 
+-------------------------+


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 2. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server
5.5 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you apply the fix, the counters are updated properly, although they are
still only updated every 10 minutes. Therefore, when an event occurs that meets
the criteria of a particular counter, it may take up to 10 minutes for the
counter to be updated in Performance Monitor.

Note that the Connection Count counter shows the number of client processes that
are currently connected to the information store. When a client connects to the
IMAP4, POP3, or NNTP port, or when a client connected to one of these ports
sends an invalid IMAP4, POP3, or NNTP command, the client does not connect to
the information store. The client only connects to the information store when it
sends a valid command.
