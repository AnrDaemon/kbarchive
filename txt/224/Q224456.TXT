TITLE   :XFOR: Properties Changed After Member Moves to Different Channel
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a user leaves a channel and then joins a different channel on the same
Microsoft Exchange Chat Service computer, the object identifier (OID) associated
with his or her member record does not change. If you send a command that
modifies a channel member's properties before he or she leaves the original
channel, but the command is not received by the server until after the user
joins the new channel, the user's properties are still modified. For example, if
you use the MODE +O command to give operator privileges to a user in a channel,
but the user moves to a different channel before the command is received by the
server, the user is still given operator privileges when the command is
received.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Chat Server

+--------------------------+
| File name   | Version    | 
+--------------------------+
| Chatsvc.exe | 5.5.2503.0 | 
+--------------------------+


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you apply the fix, if the channel specified in the command is not the same
as the channel that the user is currently a member of, the user's properties are
not modified.
