TITLE   :Active Server Pages Appear Blank in the Web Browser

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a Web site or modify an existing Web site with Visual Studio or
Visual InterDev, all ASP pages for that Web site may stop working or display
only blank content in the Web browser.

ASP pages may work properly in other Web sites or other Web applications.

All HTML files continue to work in all Web sites.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by certain "TypeLib" metadata tags that are present in the
Global.asa for the Web site experiencing this problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

Edit the Global.asa for the Web site experiencing the problem and look for the
following or similar metadata tags:

   <!--METADATA TYPE="TypeLib" NAME="Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 2.0 Library" UUID="{00000200-0000-0010-8000-00AA006D2EA4}" VERSION="2.0"-->
   <!--METADATA TYPE="TypeLib" NAME="Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects Recordset 2.0 Library" UUID="{00000300-0000-0010-8000-00AA006D2EA4}" VERSION="2.0"-->
   <!--METADATA TYPE="TypeLib" NAME="Microsoft Active Server Pages Object Library" UUID="{D97A6DA0-A85C-11CF-83AE-00A0C90C2BD8}" VERSION="2.0"-->

To determine whether you are experiencing this problem, remove any of the above
tags if they are present, as well as any additional metadata tags from the
Global.asa, and then try browsing ASP pages.

This problem is caused by having an older version of Windows Scripting
environment installed on the WWW server.

Visual Studio and Visual InterDev assume a newer version is present when creating
or managing Web sites and may create metadata tags specific to these newer
versions of the scripting environment.

To resolve this issue please obtain the latest version of the Windows Scripting
environment at http://msdn.microsoft.com/ and download the latest version for
your platform.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you can remove the Metadata tags one at a time
until you determine which ones are causing the ASP pages to not display.
However, the recommended resolution is to install the latest Windows Scripting
environment on the WWW server.
