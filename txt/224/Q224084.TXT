   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to remove the Microsoft Internet Explorer icon from
the desktop of your Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition-based
computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To remove the Internet Explorer icon from the desktop of your Terminal
Server-based computer, in the Terminal Server console, start Registry Editor,
delete the following registry key, log off, and then restart your computer:

   HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Desktop\Namespace\FBF23B42-E3F0-101B-8488-00AA003E56F8

NOTE: This is the object ID for Internet Explorer, and it should have a default
value of "The Internet".

You can reverse this procedure by manually adding the key with the default values
listed back to the original registry location. Also, the object ID remains the
same.

Note that this is also the only method to remove the icon from any Windows
NT-based system when the Windows Desktop Update is not installed.

The usual "NoInternetIcon" registry option set either manually or by an Internet
Explorer Administration Kit (IEAK) 4 or 5 custom corporate installation that can
remove the icon from the desktop has no effect without the updated shell
components that are included as part of the Windows Desktop Update. This applies
to Internet Explorer 4.x, 5, and 5.01.
