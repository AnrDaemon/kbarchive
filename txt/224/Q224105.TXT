TITLE   :XCLN: LDAP Query Returns Error Message: This Name Could Not...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:98
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Outlook, Outlook Express, or Pocket Outlook Address Book
(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [LDAP]) in Exchange Server, you may
receive the following error messages:

   There are no entries in the Directory Service that match your search
   criteria.

-or-

   This name could not be matched.

CAUSE
=====

The Search tab on the LDAP protocol object in the Microsoft Exchange Server
Administrator program may be set to something other than "Treat "any" substring
searches as "initial" substring searches".

You can find the Search tab by navigating to the following objects in the
Exchange Server Administrator program:

   Organization\Site\Protocols Container\LDAP(Directory)

-or-

   Organization\Site\Servers Container\Protocols\LDAP(Directory) Settings -
   Server

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, change the Search tab on the LDAP protocol object in
the Administrator program to "Treat "any" substring searches as "initial"
substring searches".

WORKAROUND
==========

Search Options Include:

 - "Treat "any" substring searches as "initial" substring searches (fast)"
   Specifies that only initial substring searches will be performed. Final
   substring searches will not be performed, and any substring searches are
   converted to initial substring searches (which will return partial but
   sometimes incomplete results).

 - "Allow only "initial" substring searches (fast)" Specifies that only initial
   substring searches will be performed. Final substring searches and any
   substring searches will not be performed.

 - "Allow all substring searches (slow)"
   Specifies that all substring searches will be performed, including initial,
   any, or final.

LDAP allows LDAP clients to perform searches when they are connected to a
directory. For example, if you search the directory for a particular user, LDAP
returns the entry for that user. LDAP matches the requested information with an
entry in the directory by performing substring searches. There are three types
of substring searches that LDAP can perform:

 - Initial substring search
   The directory matches the substring that the user specifies against the
   beginning of an attribute in the directory. For example, an initial substring
   search for "ne" in a display name would return Suzan Fine. Initial substring
   searches are typically faster than the other types of substring searches.

 - Final substring search
   The directory matches the substring that the user specifies against the end of
   an attribute in the directory. For example, a final substring search for "St"
   in a display name would return Stacey and Steve, but not Sean or Shannon.
   Final substring searches are typically slower than initial substring
   searches.

 - Any substring search
   The directory matches the substring that the user specifies against any
   portion of an attribute in the directory. For example, a substring search for
   "r" in a display name would return Maria and Raymond. Any substring searches
   are the slowest substring searches.
