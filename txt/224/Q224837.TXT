TITLE   :DCOM Clients Ping Server After Client Program Has Shut Down
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you run an unauthenticated distributed Component Object Model (COM) client
that uses the CoSetProxBlanket COM API to set security on its remote interface
and calls the remote server object, distributed COM (DCOM) pings may persist
even though the client program has released the interface and shut down.

CAUSE
=====

This fix is an update to the hotfix described in the following article:

   Q184278 Server in One Domain May Disconnect Client in Another Domain

This hotfix addresses the case where an unsecure client activates securely by
specifying credentials in the COAUTHINFO structure that it passes to
CoCreateInstanceEx. The client may then make secure calls using
CoSetProxyBlanket or it may simply make unsecure calls. Prior to the fix, the
server object will be cleaned up in approximately six minutes by the COM
process. Also, prior to the fix, the client computer will continue to send DCOM
pings to the server indefinitely, even after the client and server process have
exited. The fix resolves both these issue.
