TITLE   :XADM: Administrator Program Inaccurate When Mailbox Is Over 2 GB
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, under Mailbox Resources,
you can check the size of a mailbox. If a mailbox exceeds 2 GB in size, the
Exchange Server Administrator program shows the size as being 2 GB. However, the
"Total no. Items" column correctly reflects the number of messages in the
mailbox.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Server information store does not report the correct size of the
mailbox back to the Exchange Server Administrator program when it exceeds 2 GB.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
