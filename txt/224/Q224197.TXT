TITLE   :Cliex32.dll Error 126 Error Message When You Run Smsman.exe
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbtool kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install a client by using the Systems Management Installation
Wizard (Smsman.exe) in Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0, you may receive the
following error message (or one similar to it) in the Wnmanual.log file:

   Begin CliEx processing.~
   ERROR: Load of DLL CliEx32.dll failed:
   (C:\WINNT\MS\SMS\CORE\BIN\cliex32.dll),126
   ERROR: Initializing CliEx failed error code 126~
   Unable to continue; exiting~

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because of one of the following:

 - If you run the Systems Management Installation Wizard from a location other
   than the \x86.bin\00000409 folder within the SMSLOGON share of an SMS logon
   point, and then use the Automatically select installation location feature.

 - The %TEMP% or %TMP% environment variables do not exist for the target system.

 - The %TEMP% or %TMP% environment variables point to a folder which does not
   exist in the file system.

NOTE: In the case of number 3, a temporary (.TMP) file is created in the root of
C:\ (in the root of the system/boot partition), causing the sequence of errors
listed under the symptoms section.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, run the Systems Management Installation Wizard from
the \x86.bin\00000409 folder within the SMSLOGON share of an SMS logon point.
