TITLE   :STOP 0x0A in Redirector with Invalid Server Responses
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you scan directories, query file information, or do named pipes
transactions against a server, the client may experience a STOP 0x0A in
Rdr.sys.

This error may happen when there is an intermediate network device between the
client and the server or when the network adapter of one of the nodes corrupts
the data in the frames. You may see this in a network trace while the problem
happened, or the corruption can be seen in the memory dump written on the
client.


CAUSE
=====

The redirector checks for invalid SMB responses. It performs these checks only
when the return code returned by the server is ERROR_SUCCESS. Especially with
transactions (on named pipes), it may happen that the server returns errors like
ERROR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL or ERROR_MORE_DATA.


RESOLUTION
==========
