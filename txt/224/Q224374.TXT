SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 99, you may encounter the following
symptoms:

 - Encarta Encyclopedia 99 may start more slowly than you expect.

 - Media clips may be played very slowly.

CAUSE

This behavior can occur if a CD-ROM changer is installed in your computer and

changer at the same time.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around these issues, use either of the following methods:

 - Insert only one of the Encarta 99 discs in the CD-ROM changer at any given
   time. When you are prompted to insert the other Encarta Encyclopedia CD-ROM,
   remove the disc that is currently in the CD-ROM changer before you insert the
   other Encarta CD-ROM.

 - Disable the display of the Home screen when you start Encarta Encyclopedia
   99. To do this, follow these steps:

   1. Start Encarta Encyclopedia 99.

   2. Click Options, and then click Settings.

   3. Click to clear the "Display Home screen when I start Encarta Encyclopedia"
      check box.

   4. Quit and then restart Encarta Encyclopedia 99.

STATUS
