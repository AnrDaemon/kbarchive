SUMMARY
=======

Event 4097 will be logged continuously if the AS/400 Print Device is incorrect.
This event is found in the Application Event Log. The source is PPV5250. The
text of the event is "Receive and Wait verb has completed with primary return
code Dealloc Normal."

MORE INFORMATION
================

Configuration of a 5250 print session in SNA Server requires the identification
of an AS/400 Device Name. This item is part of the APPC tab in the print session
properties dialog box. If the specified AS/400 Device Name exists on the AS/400
and if it is associated with a controller for a different Microsoft SNA Server,
the print session will start. It will immediately shut down and move into
Pending status. Next, it will start and immediately shut down again. SNA Manager
will show the session changing from Active to Pending and back to Active status.
This cycle repeats as long as the Print Service is active on the SNA Server.

The resolution is to configure the print session with a unique AS/400 Device
Name.

REFERENCES
==========

The print internal trace details the status change. Examples of entries for the
status change are "AStCh New Status: pending," and "AStCh Old Status: active."
