TITLE   :SBS Modem Unavailable if Clients Do Not Disconnect
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0a,4.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtool kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server versions 4.0, 4.0a, 4.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use a Small Business Server (SBS) modem by using Modem Sharing
on your client computer, you may be unable to do so.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if another modem-sharing client computer is using the SBS
modem. Client computers that dial out by using the SBS modem are permitted
exclusive use of the modem, and this prevents other users from using the same
modem. Note that this issue can occur if a user does not explicitly disconnect
from the server or quit the communication-related program that uses the shared
modem.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, clients that use the SBS modem must disconnect from the
SBS modem or communication-related program that uses the shared modem.
