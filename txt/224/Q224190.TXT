STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
version 4.0. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT version 4.0 Service
Pack 5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To test whether or not your system has this problem, monitor the Inetinfo
process in Performance Monitor. Set up Performance Monitor to monitor the
Inetinfo process using the counters for private bytes. Monitor the Inetinfo
process for a period of time to get a baseline reading, and then create an ASP
file with the following lines:

   Response.Expires = 0
   Response.Cachecontrol = "private"

After you add these lines to the ASP file and then execute the ASP file on the
IIS computer continuously, the private bytes counter will rise accordingly.
