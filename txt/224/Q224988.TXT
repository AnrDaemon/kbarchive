TITLE   :FIX: CREATE FROM Command Incorrectly Assumes .dbf Extension
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbservicepack kbDatabase kbvfp600 kbvfp600bug kbXBase KbDBFDBC kbVS600sp2 kbVS600SP1 kb

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The CREATE FROM command incorrectly assumes that the table used to create a new
table needs a .dbf extension. For example, when using the following syntax:

CREATE [Table1] FROM [Table2]

Visual FoxPro mistakenly assumes that Table2 needs a .dbf extension added to it.
If the file already has an extension, Visual FoxPro 6.0 appends the .dbf
extension to the end of the table name; therefore, an error appears.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information
about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a program that contains the following code:

   USE HOME(2)+"\data\customer"
   COPY STRUCTURE EXTENDED TO test.STR
   USE
   CREATE customer2 FROM test.STR

2. Run the program.

   The last line of code causes the error:

   File Test.str.dbf does not exist.
