SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to set a capture filter to view only browser frames
in Network Monitor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you are troubleshooting browsing-related problems, a network trace may
help. Because browser traffic is somewhat infrequent, however, the trace may
need to run for an extended period of time to gather enough data for analysis.
Some browser information is sent only every 15 minutes, making it difficult to
capture those packets. Depending on network usage, a Network Monitor trace can
quickly become very large (many megabytes).

You can configure Network Monitor to capture only browser frames by using a
pattern match to identify these frames. This significantly reduces the size of
the capture. To set a capture filter in Network Monitor to capture only browser
packets:

1. On the Capture menu, click Filter.

2. Double-click Pattern Matches.

3. In the Offset box, type "cb" (without the quotation marks). Click "From Start
   of Frame".

4. In the Pattern box, type "4252" (without the quotation marks). Click Hex.

5. Click OK.

6. Click OK.

7. Start the capture.

For more information about using Network Monitor, see the Network Monitor Help
file in the "Systems Management Server Administrator's Guide."
