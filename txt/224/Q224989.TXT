======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In some cases, using the SQLColumns() function against a SQL Server table causes
the following error:

   There is not enough memory to complete this operation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.

For more information about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the code below, the cconstring holds the following values for each
parameter:

Driver=SQL Server
Server=Your SQL Server name
UID=Your user ID
PWD=Your password (can be blank for no password)
APP=Microsoft(r) Visual FoxPro(r)
WSID=Workstation ID
DATABASE=The database name on SQL Server.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

NOTE: You might need to alter the syntax of the cconstring variable to obtain a
valid connection to SQL Server.

1. Create a program that contains the following code and save it:

   CLOSE DATA ALL
   cconstring = "DRIVER=SQL Server;SERVER=SPHINXSQL;UID=sa;PWD=;APP=Microsoft(r) Visual FoxPro(r);WSID=WS2;DATABASE=pubs"
   PUBLIC hand
   SET SAFETY OFF
   DELETE FILE testdb.DBC
   DELETE FILE testdb.dc?
   CREATE DATA testdb
   CREATE CONNECTION testconn CONNSTRING (cconstring)

   hand=SQLCONNECT("testconn")

   ?hand
   ?SQLColumns(hand,"Publishers","FoxPro","curFields") < 0
   *?SQLColumns(hand,"Publishers","FoxPro","curFields")
   ?sqldisconnect(hand)

2. Run the program.

After the program runs, you get the error:

   There is not enough memory to complete this operation.

Note that the error does not occur every time you use the SQLColumns() function.
In the example, if you change this line of code:

   ?SQLColumns(hand,"Publishers","FoxPro","curFields") < 0

to this line:

   ?SQLColumns(hand,"Publishers","FoxPro","curFields")

the code runs without error.
