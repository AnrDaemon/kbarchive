TITLE   :HTMLA Web Site Friendly Names Are Truncated
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a new Web site using the Internet Services Manager, if certain
characters are used (other than letters or numbers), the full name in the HTMLA
Web Administration forms may be truncated.

For example, if you create a new site using the Internet Services Manager and
call it New"Web"Site (including the quotation marks), when you view the site in
the HTMLA Web Administration forms ("http://localhost/iisadmin" by default),
only "New" is viewable, instead of the Web site's full name.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is caused when the string values in an ASP script are used to
generate JavaScript literals. The characters cause a problem in the script
itself (errors), so they are truncated.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Services
version 5.0.
