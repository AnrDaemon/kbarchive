   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure an IIS Server Instance in Microsoft Cluster Server, the
Dependencies Page should have a Back, Next, and Cancel button. When the
Iisclex4.dll is not properly installed during the Windows NT Option Pack (NTOP)
installation, the Dependencies Page displays a Back, Finish, and Cancel button.

CAUSE
=====

There are two conditions that can cause this problem. The first is if you
attempt to create an IIS Server Instance using the Remote Cluster Administrator
Utility from another system instead of physically being on the Cluster Server
computer. The Remote Cluster Administrator cannot enumerate the metabase
remotely, and therefore you can not create IIS Server Instances remotely.

The second condition that can cause this problem is if the Iisclex4.dll does not
get installed, registered, or added to the registry properly during the
installation of the NTOP. To resolve the first situation, go to the Cluster
Server computer and use the Cluster Administrator on either of the Nodes to
create the IIS Server Instance.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the first situation, go to the Cluster Server computer and use the
Cluster Administrator on either of the Nodes to create the IIS Server Instance.

To resolve the second situation, perform the following steps:

1. Pick one Node in the Cluster to work on the first.

2. Confirm that the Iisclex4.dll file exists in the %windir%\system32\inetsrv
   directory. If Iisclex4.dll does not exist, then extract the file from the
   NTOP compact disc in \Ntoptpak\En\x86\Winnt.SRV\iis4_1.cab.

3. Go to a command prompt, change to the %windir%\system32\inetsrv directory and
   type the following:

   regsvr32 iisclex4.dll

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

4. Start Regedt32.exe and locate the following registry subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Cluster\Resource Types\IIS Server Instance

5. Click Edit.

6. Choose Add Value.

7. Enter the following registry key information:

   Value Name: AdminExtensions
   Data Type: REG_MULTI_SZ
   Date: {92BF7500-974C-11D0-A5F2-00A0C922E752}

   NOTE: The brackets in the data string are required.

8. Repeat steps 2 through 7 on the other Node in the Cluster.

9. Close Registry Editor on both Nodes and restart each Node one at a time.

After the systems have been restarted, you can create an IIS Server Instance in
your Cluster Administrator.
