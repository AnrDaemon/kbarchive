-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Locked property of the 32-bit DBList and DBCombo controls is set to
True, the following problems may occur:

 - Attempts to programmatically modify the Text or BoundText properties cause
   error 387 - Property can't be set on this control.

 - The control does not show data from the current record.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a bug in the Visual Basic 5.0 Data Bound List Controls
(DBList32.ocx) in the version that ships with the product (5.00.3714) and in the
version that ships with Service Pack 2 (5.01.4319).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in version 5.01.4511 of
the DBList32.ocx file that ships in Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 3.

Base:

For a list of the Visual Basic 5.0 bugs that were fixed in the Visual Studio 97
Service Pack 3, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

This bug does not occur with any 16-bit versions of Visual Basic.

Although this bug did not occur with the 32-bit version of Visual Basic 4.0, the
bug can cause problems with 32-bit applications built by Visual Basic 4.0.

If an application built by the 32-bit version of Visual Basic 4.0 uses the Data
Bound List Controls and an application built by Visual Basic 5.0 is installed on
that same machine, the older version of the Data Bound List Controls will be
overwritten and the bug may occur.
