TITLE   :XCON: Event ID 55 Incorrect Link Option
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When connecting Microsoft Exchange Server X.400 Connector to a remote message
transfer agent (MTA) using 1988 mode, you may encounter the following Event ID
logged in the Windows NT Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 55
   Source: MSExchangeMTA
   Category: security

   The incorrect link option mode was specified by the binding remote entity
   /O=org/OU=site_name/CN=CONFIGURATION/CN=CONNECTIONS/CN=remoteMTA ,
   association index: 2130. [MTA XFER-IN 22 35] (14)

The connection will fail.

CAUSE
=====

The Event ID indicates that the remote MTA is trying to negotiate a two way
alternate link option which is not a valid option for this connection. This
setting can be verified and changed in the X.400 Link Options check box
selection on the Advancd tab of the X.400 Connector properties page of the
Exchange Server Administrator program.

SOLUTION
--------

Disable the two way alternate option from the remote MTA and configure it to use
monologue.
