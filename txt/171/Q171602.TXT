TITLE   :WD97: Cannot Insert Address from Schedule+ Address Book
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,2.0,7.0,97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbusage word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 2.0, 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have Microsoft Outlook installed and you select Insert Address in
Microsoft Word, the Microsoft Schedule+ Contact List is not available.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. When Outlook is installed, it becomes the primary
contact list provider on your system. Other lists are no longer available when
you select the Insert Address feature from the toolbar, the Letter Wizard, or
from the Envelope and Labels dialog box.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, import the Schedule+ Contact List into Outlook, and
then use the Outlook Contact List to insert an address into Word.

Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use addresses from an electronic address book or an Outlook 97 or
Schedule+ 95 contact list by clicking Insert Address in certain dialog boxes and
wizards.

The Schedule+ Contact List is still available when you select a mail merge data
source in the Mail Merge Helper. This is because the Open Data Source dialog box
uses the address book converter rather than MAPI functions to access the list.
