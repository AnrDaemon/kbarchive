SYMPTOMS
========

As you enter data using a Masked Edit control, the cursor and data are
right-aligned instead of left-aligned. However, with certain fonts (such as
Courier New) the cursor may be left-aligned although the data you type is still
right-aligned.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem is fixed in the newer version of the
Masked Edit control (MSMASK32.OCX) provided with Visual Studio 97 Service Pack
2.

For more information on the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q170365 : INFO: Visual Studio 97 Service Packs - What, Where, and Why

For a list of the Visual Basic 5.0 bugs that were fixed in the Visual Studio 97
Service Pack 2, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

   Q171554 : INFO: Visual Basic 5.0 Fixes in Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2

MORE INFORMATION
================

The normal behavior of the Masked Edit control is that the cursor and text are
left-aligned. The right-alignment problem only occurs when you are using
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 and you install the NT 4.0 Service Pack 3.
