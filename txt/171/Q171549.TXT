PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows

KEYWORDS:kbVBp500 kbVS97sp2fix kbGrpDSVBDB kbvbp500sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Cached Class Factorys can get released by illegal thread.

CAUSE
=====

The repository maintains a cache of class factorys. If a class factory has not
been accessed for a short period of time, the reference to the class factory
will get released. However, the reference is released from a different thread
than the one that initially obtained the reference.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service
Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The behavior above violates the apartment-threading model, and can cause a
crash.

This behavior is evident when a repository object is implemented in Visual Basic.
This only occurs in Visual Basic where a class is defined as the class that is
the implementation of the generic repository class. This behavior occurs when
the ClassID for the Visual Basic class matches the repository classdef's
ClassID. It crashes when the client creates an instance before the cache is
released. When the engine releases the class factory cache, the crash occurs.
