TITLE   :FIX: Source Code Control Integration Holds .dat Files Open
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe500bug kbVS97sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Studio 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The .DAT files in the Visual SourceSafe data directory are unexpectedly left
open, causing such operations as backing up the database to fail.

CAUSE
=====

When using the Source Code Control integration with other developer products,
such as Visual Basic 5.0 and Visual C++ 5.0, the integration component holds the
Rights.Dat, Status.Dat, etc. open any time a source- code controlled project is
opened. This prevents these files from being backed up if a user inadvertently
leaves a developer application(s) running.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2. The SourceSafe integration
component will then close the files after a period of inactivity, allowing for
the files to be backed up.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2.
