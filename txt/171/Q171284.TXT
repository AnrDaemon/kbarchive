======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running Windows 95 on a computer with CardBus slots, you may
experience the following symptoms:

 - When multiple PC Cards are installed and the computer is started, Windows may
   not start and you may receive the following error message:

   While initializing ... device V86MMGR: Insufficient memory to initialize
   Windows.

 - If Windows is running with one PC Card inserted, the computer may become
   unresponsive for several minutes when you insert another PC Card. When the
   computer returns from this busy state, Device Manager Reports the new card as
   disabled because of a resource conflict (code 12).

CAUSE
=====

These symptoms can occur if there are not enough available IRQ lines for all the
installed devices.

RESOLUTION
==========


To work around this issue, make more IRQ resources available by disabling a
device (such as a COM port or LPT port). Such devices can typically be disabled
in Device Manager.

STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If there are not enough available IRQ lines, there is no configuration that
allows all devices to be active without a resource conflict. A device must be
removed or disabled to free an IRQ line and allow the remaining devices to be
configured successfully.
