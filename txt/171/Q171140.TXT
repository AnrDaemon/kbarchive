======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Certificate Server version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to create a client certificate for Microsoft Internet Explorer
through the Microsoft Internet Explorer Enrollment Form, you may get an error
message similar to the following:

   Microsoft VBScript runtime error '800a0046'
   Permission denied
   /CertSrv/CertEnroll/ceaccept.asp, line 10

CAUSE
=====

The IUSR_computername account does not have access to the Certificate Server
shared folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

Give the IUSR_computername account Read access to the shared folder, and the
certificates will be issued properly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the anonymous account (or logged-in user) does not have at least Read access
to the Well Known Directory, the certificate generation process will fail. An
error message will be returned, formatted as an HTML document.

The Well Known Directory is the name given to the shared folder required by the
Certificate Server Setup program. This share contains information specific to
the Self-Signed Certificate (Root CA).
