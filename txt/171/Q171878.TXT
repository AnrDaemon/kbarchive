TITLE   :FIX: Cursor Library Memory Leak in Multithreaded Environment
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)

KEYWORDS:kbODBC kbMDAC250fix

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

BUG #: 1251/4210 (odbcsdk)

SYMPTOMS
========

When the cursor library is loaded in a multithreaded application, a memory leak
occurs.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Open Database
Connectivity versions 2.5 and 3.0. This problem has been corrected in U.S.
Service Pack 1 for Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 3.0. For more
information, contact your primary support provider.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem is created when multiple threads establish connections specifying
that the ODBC Cursor Library is to be used. For example, if each thread of a
multithread application creates a connection using the SQLSetConnection(hdbc,
SQL_ODBC_CURSORS, SQL_CUR_USE_ODBC) statement and subsequently executes it
repeatedly, you can use the Process Viewer to observe a memory leak.
