SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using the Microsoft 32-bit Data Link Control protocol (MSDLC32) and
you suspend Windows 95 (using power management features), you may receive a
"Fatal Exception 06" or "Fatal Exception 0E" error message when you resume
Windows 95. The error message may be similar to the following message:

   A fatal exception 0E has occurred at 0028:<xxxxxxxx> in VxD VMM(06) +
   <xxxxxxxx>.

unpredictable behavior when you resume the computer.
