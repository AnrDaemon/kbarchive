SYMPTOMS
========

When you remove Internet Information Server (IIS) from a computer, it may be
necessary to remove Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS).

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95 or Windows NT. Microsoft cannot guarantee
those problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. Make a backup of your registry
before attempting to make registry changes

Steps to remove Microsoft Transaction Server:

1. Ensure that no MTS server processes are running when you remove MTS by typing
   MTXSTOP at a command prompt.

2. Make sure that MSDTC is not running by running the following at a command
   prompt:

      net stop msdtc

3. Delete your entire MTX directory, and remove it from the Recycle Bin.

4. Delete the HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Transaction Server key.

5. Delete the HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ Setup\OC
   Manager\Subcomponents\MTS* key.

6. Delete the HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MMC\SnapIns\MTS key.

7. Go to the Control Panel, System, Environment, and remove :\mtx from the
   System Variables path.
