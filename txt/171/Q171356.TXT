TITLE   :Octopus 3.0 Beta May Cause WinNT to Boot In a Continuous Loop
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Octopus Beta 3.0 software, the system restarts in a continuous
loop.

CAUSE
=====

The system loads ntdetect and ntldr and proceeds to the blue screen and displays
the build info. The screen goes black and the system restarts.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem, perform one of the following steps:

If the System is FAT
--------------------

1. Rename c:\SystemRoot\System32\Drivers\Octopus.sys to Octopus.sav.

2. Using a text editor, create a 0 byte file called Octopus.sys. Copy this file
   to c:\SystemRoot\System32\Drivers\.

3. Restart Windows NT.

4. Run the uninstall program that came with Octopus and restart the system.

If the System is NTFS
---------------------

1. Install Windows NT into a separate directory.

2. Follow steps 1 through 4 above.

3. Delete the parallel installation of Windows NT and change the boot.ini file
   back to the original settings.
