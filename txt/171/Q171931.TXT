PRODUCT :Microsoft Press

KEYWORDS:kbpolicy

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the process for obtaining a replacement CD-ROM or
diskette for any Microsoft Press companion CD-ROMs and floppy disks.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If your CD-ROM or floppy disk is clearly physically defective (cracked, badly
warped, contains a deep scratch, etc.), you can exchange it for a replacement
CD-ROM or floppy disk in the United States of America by calling Microsoft Press
at 800-MS-PRESS.

If you are outside the United States of America, please contact your local
Microsoft Press distributor or subsidiary. For a list of distributors, please
connect to the Microsoft Press Web site at

   http://mspress.microsoft.com/

and look for the English Language Distributors list.

IMPORTANT: Replacing the CD-ROM or floppy disk will not solve any software
related issues. Therefore, replacement should be considered only if the Setup
program fails and if there are no other known problems posted on the Microsoft
Press Support Web site at:

   http://mspress.microsoft.com/support/

Unfortunately we currently cannot provide replacement disk contents via the Web
due to legal considerations. However, individual file patches are posted on the
Internet when appropriate. Please refer to the Microsoft Press Support Web site
for further information.

If you need further assistance obtaining a replacement disc, please e- mail
MSPINPUT@MICROSOFT.COM.
