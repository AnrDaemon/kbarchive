SUMMARY
=======

When installing Learn Visual C++ Now, ISBN: 1-55615-845-9, files on a computer
running Windows 3.x, many of the files may fail to copy.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error is typically caused by using an older version of Mscdex.exe to access
this CD-ROM. Mscdex.exe version 2.23 or later is required to properly install
the files from this CD-ROM. This version is included with MS-DOS 6.0 and later,
as well as Windows 3.1.

To resolve this issue, use the following steps to be certain that Mscdex.exe is
version 2.23 or later:

1. If you are in Windows 3.1, double-click the MS-DOS Prompt icon in the Program
   Manager Main group.

2. At the MS-DOS prompt, enter the following command:

   " Mscdex.exe" (without the quotation marks)

If the version information returned is earlier than 2.23, continue with the
following steps:

1. Locate all versions of Mscdex.exe on your hard disk by entering the following
   command (MS-DOS version 5.0 and later):

   " dir \mscdex.exe /s" (without the quotation marks)

   This command returns a list of all folders containing the file Mscdex.exe,
   including the file date.

2. Make a note of the folder path that contains the most recent version of
   Mscdex.exe. This path will likely be one of the following:

   C:\DOS              (MS-DOS 5.0 or 6.x contains latest driver)
   C:\WINDOWS          (Windows 3.1 contains latest driver)
   C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND  (Windows 95 contains latest driver)

   Once you know where the latest version of Mscdex.exe is located, update your
   autoexec.bat to reference this file:

3. Type "Exit" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt to return to
   Windows.

4. In the Program Manager, click the File menu, and then click Run.

5. Type the word "sysedit" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

   The System Editor will appear with the listing of your autoexec.bat and other
   configuration files.

6. Locate the line that runs Mscdex.exe. If the line refers to an older folder,
   change the path to the folder identified in step 4 above.

7. On the File menu, click Close. When Sysedit asks if you wish to save changes
   to the autoexec.bat, click Yes.

If you made a change to the autoexec.bat, exit Windows and reboot your computer
to make the change take effect. If you require additional assistance configuring
Mscdex.exe, please contact Microsoft Technical Support (or your original
equipment manufacturer if Windows and MS-DOS came preinstalled on your
computer).
