SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to start the cluster service for Microsoft Cluster Server, you
may observe one or more of the following errors:

   1715 The server is not listening.

-or-

   1753 There are no more endpoints available from the endpoint mapper.

-or-

   1740 The endpoint is a duplicate.

CAUSE
=====

These error messages may occur as a result of network or network adapter related
problems. If the cluster service fails, it will attempt to restart. However, if
the network adapter or network fails and none is available to the cluster
service, the cluster service may not restart.

RESOLUTION
==========

Check network connections and network devices for proper functionality. You may
need to reset or replace related hardware or restart the computer that
experiences the errors.

NOTE: If you are having problems opening Cluster Administrator and are receiving
RPC errors, try connecting with ".", but do not use the quotation marks.
