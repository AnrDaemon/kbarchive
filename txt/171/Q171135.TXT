The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 2.0, 3.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to access a web site, the browser displays the following error
message:

   HTTP/1.1 403 Access Forbidden

   Secure Channel Required

   This virtual directory requires a browser that supports the configured
   encryption options.

CAUSE
=====

The web site you are trying to access requires the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
encryption protocol. As a result, http:// will not work.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the URL to read https://. This instructs the browser to use the Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption protocol.
