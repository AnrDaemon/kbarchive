TITLE   :Windows NT Services for Macintosh May Not Start in Desired Zone
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On some networks, Windows NT Services for Macintosh may not start in the
configured zone every time. The computer may choose a zone at random or may
choose the network's default zone each time.

Similar behavior can be seen if the Windows NT Server computer is in a multiple
seeded range where the ranges are not exactly the same for the zones, which can
cause confusion among nonseed routers. This would also affect browsing for
printers because the printers may go back and forth between the different seeded
ranges. An example would be seed router A routes 1-5 while, on the same net
seed, router b routes 2-6. The devices listing 1 or 6 as their seeded range
would not be visible by the other ranges.

CAUSE
=====

Some routers may send late responses to "Get Net Info" AppleTalk Request,
causing Service for Macintosh to come up in the wrong zone.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
