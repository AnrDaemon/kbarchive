MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have an Add-in containing a Commandbar and you exit Visual Basic, it
could possibly result in a corrupt menu system if the Add-in does not delete its
Commandbar before Visual Basic exits. Specifically, the Tools or Add-in menus
may become corrupt. For example, the Add Procedure, Procedure Attributes, and
Menu Editor may be missing from the Tools menu.

This is caused by not properly deleting the Commandbar from the Add-in's Menu
when the Add-in is removed (usually in the IDTExtensibility_OnDisconnection
event).

This is not a common occurrence because the code to delete the Commandbar from
the Add-in is automatically generated for you when you create a new Add-in
project and is placed in the IDTExtensiblity_OnDisconnection event. This code
should resemble the following:

      'Delete the Commandbar entry
      mcbMenuCommandBar.Delete
