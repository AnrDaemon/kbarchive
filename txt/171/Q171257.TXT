TITLE   :Assignment of LUs to Null Subnet (0.0.0.0) Not Fully Supported
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server 3.0 supports the ability to assign 3270 LUs to workstations. Although
it is possible to assign 3270 LUs to an IP subnet address, this does not work
reliably in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1).

Assigning an LU to a null (0.0.0.0) subnet will fail in SNA Server version 3.0
SP1 if any other IP subnets or workstation addresses are subsequently added.

CAUSE
=====

The ability to assign an LU to a null subnet was added in SNA Server version 3.0
SP1; however, in order for this feature to work properly, the null subnet must
be the last address in the list.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, the null subnet no longer needs to be the last address on
the list.
