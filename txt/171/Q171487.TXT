-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to set the Tag property of one of the Windows Common Controls
(COMCTL32.OCX) at run-time may result in the following error and cause the
application to terminate:

   "VB5 caused an invalid page fault in module COMCTL32.OCX at 0137:202cb2a8."

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the object variable that you are trying to assign to
the Tag property is uninitialized or is null.

RESOLUTION
==========

In Visual Basic 5.0, you can work around the problem by checking the value of
the variable before assigning it to the Tag property:

      Dim x As Object
      '...
      If x Is Nothing Then
         '
      Else
         StatusBar1.Panels(1).Tag = x
      End If

STATUS
======
