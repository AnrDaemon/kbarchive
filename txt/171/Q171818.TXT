TITLE   :FIX: IDE Crashes When Repeatedly Placing a Control on a Form
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp500 kbVS97sp2fix kbGrpDSVB kbvbp500sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you select a control from the Toolbox with the mouse, immediately press the
ENTER key to create the control instance on a form, UserDocument, or property
page, and then quickly click on the Toolbox again, the following error may
occur:

   "VB5 has created an invalid page fault in module VB5.EXE at 0137:00568412"

CAUSE
=====

The problem is that the Toolbox registers the two single clicks as a double
click. It then assumes that the control to be created has already been selected
by the first click. However, when the ENTER key was pressed between the two
clicks, the control selection was set back to 0, so the correct control is no
longer selected when the second click occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2 or allow time for the control to be
created before clicking on the Toolbox again.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service
Pack 2.

For more information on the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q170365 INFO: Visual Studio 97 Service Packs - What, Where, and Why

For a list of the Visual Basic 5.0 bugs that were fixed in the Visual Studio 97
Service Pack 2, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

   Q171554 INFO: Visual Basic 5.0 Fixes in Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior occurs whenever you click a control on the Toolbox, hit the ENTER
key to create the control, and then click on the Toolbox again within the space
and time limit of a double-click.

NOTE: This is easier to reproduce if the 'double-click' time set via the Control
Panel is increased (set to slower).

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Visual Basic 5.0 Standard EXE project.

2. Click on a control in the Toolbox, immediately press the ENTER key and then
   quickly click on the same control in the Toolbox.

An invalid page fault may occur if the second click occurs within the space and
time limit of the double-click setting.
