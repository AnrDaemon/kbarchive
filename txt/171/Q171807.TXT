TITLE   :FIX: Selected Tab Changes After Removing Tab in Tabstrip
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp500 kbVS97sp2fix kbGrpDSVB kbvbp500sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When removing a tab from a Tabstrip control at run-time, the first Tab in the
Tabstrip is not selected. This behavior is not consistent with Visual Basic 4.0.
In Visual Basic 4.0, the first Tab in the Tabstrip is always selected when a Tab
is removed at run-time.

STATUS
======

beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service
Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic 5.0.

2. Choose Components from the Project menu and select "Microsoft Windows Common
   Controls 5.0."

3. Add a Tabstrip control to Form1.

4. Add a CommandButton to Form1.

5. Type the following code in the module for Form1.

         Option Explicit

               Private Sub Command1_Click()
                  TabStrip1.Tabs.Remove 1
               End Sub

               Private Sub Form_Load()
                  TabStrip1.Tabs(1).Caption = "Tab1"
                  TabStrip1.Tabs.Add , , "Tab2"
                  TabStrip1.Tabs.Add , , "Tab3"
                  TabStrip1.Tabs.Add , , "Tab4"
                  TabStrip1.Tabs.Add , , "Tab5"
               End Sub

6. Run the project.

7. Select Tab3.

8. Click Command1.

Tab3 was selected before you clicked the CommandButton to remove Tab1. However,
now Tab4 is the selected tab. To be consistent with the behavior in Visual Basic
4.0, the selected tab should be the first Tab in the Tabstrip after any Tab is
removed.
