The following sample Visual Basic for Applications macro calculates the number of
months between 1/23/1993 and 11/2/1993:

      Sub Date_MonthsBetweenDates()
         Dim dBeginDate As Date
         Dim dEndDate As Date
         Dim intMonths As Integer
         ' Beginning date.
         dBeginDate = DateValue("1/1/1993")
         ' Ending Date.
         dEndDate = DateValue("2/1/1993")
         ' Calculate number of months between dates.
         intMonths = ((Year(dEndDate) - Year(dBeginDate)) * 12) + _
            Month(dEndDate) - Month(dBeginDate)
         ' Display number of months.
         MsgBox Str$(intMonths) & " month(s)"
      End Sub

NOTE: The number of months returned by this macro is not based on the exact
number of days between the two dates. For example, given a start date of
10/31/1993 and an end date of 11/2/1993, the macro returns one month.
