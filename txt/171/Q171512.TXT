Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project.

2. Add a UserControl.

3. Insert a CommandButton into the UserControl's designer.

4. Add the following code to the UserControl's code window:

         Private Sub Command1_GotFocus()
                 Debug.Print "Command GF"
             End Sub

             Private Sub Command1_LostFocus()
                 Debug.Print "Command LF"
             End Sub

             Private Sub UserControl_EnterFocus()
                 Debug.Print "ENTERFOCUS"
             End Sub

             Private Sub UserControl_ExitFocus()
                 Debug.Print "EXITFOCUS"
             End Sub

5. Add a PropertyPage to the project.

6. Insert an instance of the UserControl onto the PropertyPage.

7. Insert a CommandButton onto the PropertyPage.

8. Add the following code to the PropertyPage's code window:

         Private Sub Command1_GotFocus()
             Debug.Print "Command1 on property page GF"
         End Sub

         Private Sub Command1_LostFocus()
             Debug.Print "Command1 on property page LF"
         End Sub

9. In the UserControl's property browser, set the PropertyPage to PropertyPage1.

10. Insert an instance of the UserControl on Form1.

11. Right-click on the UserControl. Click Properties.

12. Click on the CommandButton.

   RESULT: NO EVENTS fire off, the Usercontrol's CommandButton should have
   gotten its LostFocus, the Usercontrol should have gotten its ExitFocus and
   the CommandButton should have gotten its GotFocus event.
