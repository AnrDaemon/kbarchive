TITLE   :SMSINST: Error Creating Registry Keys with Empty Values
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbsms120bug kbsmsInst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are logged on as an administrator and try to run an executable from the
Systems Management Server Installer, the following error message appears:

   **
   ERROR
   You do not have access to make the required system configuration
   modifications. Please rerun this installation from an administrators
   account.
   **

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur when the Systems Management Server Installer attempts to
write to the client's registry and the configuration requires that the registry
contain a subkey that actually has no values in it. This may occur with most
Windows NT services that are installed.

WORKAROUND
==========

Add a value with no data, to allow the subkey to be copied and installed, as in
the following example:

   MainKey
   SubKey
   Value = Keep; REG_SZ; Data=""

STATUS
======

This problem was corrected in the latest version of the Systems Management
Server Installer.
