SUMMARY
=======

This article explains the relationship of retaining transactions and transaction
object.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An OLE DB application can use ITransactionLocal::StartTransaction to begin a
transaction if the transaction object is supported by providers.
ITransactionLocal is an interface on the session object, and can be
QueryInterface from any other interface on the session object. Information
regarding a transaction can be retrieved by calling the GetTransactionInfo
method.

The Commit or Abort method of the transaction object can be used to commit or
abort a transaction. The Commit and Abort methods allow you to specify whether
or not to retain a transaction. If you do not retain the transaction object, a
new transaction will not be started after the original transaction is finished,
and the transaction object will become inactive. The only valid action for the
transaction object will be to release it. To retain a transaction, set
fRetaining flag to TRUE in the Commit or Abort method.

The OLE DB Provider for ODBC version 1.1 supports transaction object and
commit/abort retaining. Transactions can be committed synchronously,
asynchronously, or two-phased, depending on the setting of XACTTC flag. With
fRetaining set to TRUE, however, the XACTTC flag must be set to zero. The OLE DB
Provider for ODBC version 1.1 does not support any setting of XACTTC flag when
fRetaining set to TRUE.
