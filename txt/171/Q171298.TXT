TITLE   :SMS: Win95 Clients May Get a GPF Logging on to a NetWare Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.2 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbPGC smspgc

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using shared packages after applying Systems Management Server 1.2
Service Pack 2, the Windows 95 clients may get a general protection fault (GPF)
in Appctl95 when logging on to a Novell NetWare network. No error will occur
with clients logging on to a Windows NT network. Also, if there are no shared
packages at the client workstation, no error will occur.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform the following steps to use the original
Systems Management Server 1.2 version of Nadapi95.dll:

1. Retrieve Nadapi95.dl_ from the Systems Management Server 1.2 CD and rename
   the file to Nadapi95.dll (it is not compressed).

2. Copy Nadapi95.dll to the Sms\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\X86.bin\
   directory on the computer running Systems Management Server. Nadapi95.dll
   will be replicated to your logon servers from this directory.

3. After Nadapi95.dll is on the logon servers, then the System.map file in a
   text editor such as Notepad and then save it. Be sure to make no changes to
   the System.map file. Simply opening the file and saving it will update the
   time stamp, which causes the clients to go into verify mode. The client will
   then get the correct Nadapi95.dll copied to its Windows directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2 Service Pack 2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft
