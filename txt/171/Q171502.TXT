PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp500 kbVS97sp2fix kbGrpDSVB kbvbp500sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Visual Basic may crash when a Stop action or Breakpoint is encountered in the
ReadProperties event of a UserControl.

CAUSE
=====

The ReadProperties event occurs before a UserControl is completely loaded.

If a Runtime error, Stop statement, or Breakpoint is encountered during this
time, and a Watch is set on a variable of the UserControl, Visual Basic may
crash.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2 (SP2) or do not use a Stop statement or
Breakpoint in the ReadProperties event of a UserControl when a watch is set on a
UserControl variable.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service
Pack 2.
