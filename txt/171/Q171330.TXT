This article discusses two batch files that are included in Microsoft Routing

Rtripinf.bat and Ipxinf.bat and they are used to gather information for
troubleshooting configuration problems with an RRAS router.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Installing Routing and Remote Access Service Update for Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
is a two-step process. Initially, you are prompted for a location of where to
expand the installation files. The default location for these files is Program
Files\Routing. In the Routing folder, there are two folders: Doc and Support.
The Doc folder contains a .doc version of the Administrators Guide, as well as
several SNMP MIB files. The Support folder contains three files and the Debug
folder structure where you will find the debug symbols for Routing and Remote
Access Service.

For additional information on installing debug symbols, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

The three files in the Support folder are Ipxfix.txt, Rtripinf.bat, and
Ipxinf.bat. Ipxfix.txt is the text of the following Knowledge Base article:
