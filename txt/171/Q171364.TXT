SUMMARY
=======

The license agreement in the first printing of the "Microsoft Windows NT
Workstation Resource Kit" version 4.0 incorrectly states that the Resource Kit
utilities are covered by a single-use license.

This license agreement is printed on the last paper page and has been corrected
in later printings to provide a site license.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The license agreement provided on the last paper page of the Microsoft Windows
NT 4.0 Workstation Resource Kit states the following in the "agreement"
section:

1. GRANT OF LICENSE. Microsoft grants to you the right to use one copy of the
   Microsoft software program included with this book (the "SOFTWARE") on a
   single terminal connected to a single computer....

This single-use license agreement is incorrect. The Windows NT 4.0 Workstation
Resource Kit CD-ROM is actually covered by a site license agreement. The Windows
NT 4.0 Server Resource Kit, which contains the same utilities plus additional
utilities, correctly states the following key license information:

1. GRANT OF LICENSE. Microsoft grants to you the right to install and use copies
   of the Microsoft software program included with this book (the "SOFTWARE") on
   computers you own....

NOTE: The above excerpt is not an official written license agreement for any
Microsoft or Microsoft Press product. There are other changes to the license
agreement wording that are not listed here.

For the correct Windows NT 4.0 Workstation Resource Kit license agreement, please
refer to the Windows NT 4.0 Server Resource Kit license agreement. If you do not
have the Windows NT 4.0 Server Resource Kit, please contact Microsoft Press
through e-mail at MSPINPUT@MICROSOFT.COM or send a letter request to:
