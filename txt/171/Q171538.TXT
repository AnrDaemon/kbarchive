1. Create an interface that has both a property and relationship.

2. Retrieve the root object's class object and add the interface.

3. Try to set a property from that interface after the TIM has been fully
   created.

   Note that in Visual Basic, an "Automation Error" occurs.

   In Visual C++, the following error message is returned:

   "Can't set property on repository TIM objects"
