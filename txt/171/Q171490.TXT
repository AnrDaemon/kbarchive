SYMPTOMS
========

While expanding and collapsing folders in the Project Explorer Window of an
ActiveX EXE project that contains a UserDocument and an ActiveX Designer, the
UserDocument disappears and is no longer found in the Project Explorer. Often a
General Protection Fault or Invalid Page Fault will follow, either after the
UserDocument disappears or when attempting to save the project.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The bug is difficult to reproduce, but can be reproduced with an ActiveX EXE
project that contains a UserDocument and an ActiveX Designer. If you toggle the
folders in the Project Explorer from one state to another, the UserDocument will
no longer be visible. Once the UserDocument disappears, it cannot be retrieved
and, in most cases, a General Protection Fault or similar error will occur.
