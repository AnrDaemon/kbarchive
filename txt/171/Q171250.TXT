TITLE   :Host Account Cache Database Is Lost When Promoted To Master
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a SNA Host Account Cache service configured as Backup is promoted to
Master, the current Host Account Database(
<HostSecDir>\HSsystem\DBase.DBS) will be replaced by a new empty DBase.DBS
file. The only Events logged are:

(source = SNA Host Security)<BR/>
   - event 1325 - SNA Host Account Cache Stopped.<BR/>
   - event 1324 - SNA Host Account Cache Started, Database Synchronized.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Host Account Cache service, when configured as Backup, is designed to
delete its local copy of the Host Account Database when it is stopped.

When a Backup SNA Host Account Cache service is promoted to Master, it will stop
and restart itself in the new role. During the stopping process, the local copy
of the Dbase.dbs file is deleted and the SNA Host Account Cache service then
restarts successfully but with an empty database.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0 Service
Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
