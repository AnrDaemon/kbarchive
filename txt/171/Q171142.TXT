2. Click the Security tab.

3. Select the Safety level button.

4. Set the safety level to Medium or None.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Internet Explorer Enrollment Form uses an ActiveX Control
(Certenr3.dll) to create client certificates for Microsoft Internet Explorer. It
has been demonstrated that ActiveX controls can cause a security risk when used
improperly. Therefore, Microsoft Internet Explorer contains configurable
security settings that allow you to disable the "active" content on web pages.
When you set the security to High, you disable the functionality of the
Certenr3.dll file.
