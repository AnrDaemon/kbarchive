TITLE   :FIX: Engine: Collection Object Doesn't Access Correctly by Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0; WINNT:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVS97sp2fix kbvbp500sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a Naming relationship on an object and you add an instance such
as:

      x.add Obj,"12"

you cannot access this object by name, such as:

      set y = x("12")

CAUSE
=====

If you use a string that can be evaluated as a number (such as "12") for the
name of an object in a naming relationship, you cannot access that object by
that name. The reason is that the repository evaluates any string that could be
a number as an index rather than a name.

STATUS
======

beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service
