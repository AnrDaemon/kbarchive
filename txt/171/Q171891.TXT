======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to connect a Windows NT-based computer to a Windows 95-based
computer by using a 32-bit Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
(TCP/IP) stack and Arcnet, you may be unable to do so.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because Windows NT uses Raw Arcnet and Windows 95 uses
Encapsulated Arcnet. Because of this difference, these two computers are unable
to communicate with each other using TCP/IP.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use a 16-bit TCP/IP stack with Novell ODI drivers on
Windows 95.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 95. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.
