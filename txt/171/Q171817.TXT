When a Visual Basic UserControl tries to read ContainedControls in Visual
FoxPro, the following runtime error occurs:

   "32768, "Application-defined or Object-defined error""

This problem is corrected with Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2. However, any
Visual Basic 5.0 ActiveX Controls built before the installation of the Service
Pack will need to be recompiled.

Pack 2.

---------------------------

1. Create a new ActiveX Control project.

2. Name the UserControl "VBContainer" without the quotes.

3. Name the Project "TestVBBuiltContainer" without the quotes.

4. Set the ControlContainer property to True.

5. Add the following code to VBContainer:

         Public Property Let Caption(ByVal s As String)
                  'See if ContainedControls works
                  On Error Resume Next
                  MsgBox "ContainedControls count =" _
                     & UserControl.ContainedControls.Count
                  If Err.Number <> 0 Then
                     MsgBox "ContainedControls failed." & vbCrLf & _
                        Err.Number & ": " & Err.Description
                  End If
               End Property

               Private Sub UserControl_DblClick()
                  Caption = "Hi"
               End Sub

6. From the File menu, select Make TestVBBuiltContainer.ocx.

7. Start Visual FoxPro.

8. In the Command Window, enter the following command:

   Create Form

9. From the Form Controls Toolbar, select the OLE Container Control.

10. Place the OLE Container Control on the Form.

11. Select Insert Control from the Insert Object dialog.

12. Select TestVBBuiltContainer from the Object Type list, and click OK.

13. In the Properties Window, try to set the Caption for the control. You will
   receive the error described at the beginning of this article.

14. Run the Form and double-click on the control. You will again receive the
   error described at the beginning of this article.
