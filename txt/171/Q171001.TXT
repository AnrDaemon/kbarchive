TITLE   :XCON: Connection Difficulties When RAS Session Is In Progress
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When one or more Microsoft Exchange Server computers are configured for Dynamic
RAS and there is a Dynamic RAS session in progress, the Microsoft Exchange
client and the Exchange Administrator program may have difficulty connecting to
the server.

CAUSE
=====

During initialization, the Microsoft Exchange client and the Exchange
Administrator program send Remote Procedure Calls to the configured default
gateway. By default, these calls are sent over the active RAS connection.

RESOLUTION
==========

To disable RAS as the default gateway, end any active RAS sessions and perform
the following steps:

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program and expand the
   Configuration item.

2. Choose Connection and select the RAS item from the left pane.

3. On the General tab, select RAS Phone Book item.

4. On the Server tab, select TCP/IP settings.

5. Deselect the "Use default gateway on remote server" checkbox.

6. Click OK.
