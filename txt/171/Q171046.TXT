 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you save a Word 97 document as an HTML document, the following underline
styles are lost: Dotted, Thick, Dash, Dot Dash, Dot Dot Dash, and Wave formats.
Word changes the Single, Words Only, and Double underline styles to a standard
underline.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design in Word 97. When you are editing an HTML document,
you can only select standard underline in the Font dialog box. No special
effects are available.
