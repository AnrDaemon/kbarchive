TITLE   :and /Pwd: Parameters Fail In SNA Server 3.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

An SNA Server client running the SNA Server 3.0 (or 3.0 SP1) Windows 3.x client
is not able to establish a sponsor connection to an SNA Server if Wnap.exe is
autostarted using the /User: and /Pwd: parameters to automate the client logon.
The following is an example of a WNAP command that uses these parameters

   wnap /user:<username> /pwd:<password>

where <username> is a valid Windows NT user name and <password> is
the password for this user name.

When the sponsor connection fails, you receive the following error message:

   SNA Server Warning: 629
   No SNA Server Configuration Broadcast received.
   A Server must be available before you can use 3270 or APPC.

The problem does not occur if the parameters are all uppercase.

The /User: and /Pwd: parameters are documented in Appendix A of the SNA Server
version 3.0 "Planning Guide."

CAUSE
=====

The Wnap.exe program included with the SNA Server 3.0 Windows 3.x client does
not correctly parse the /User: and /Pwd: parameters if they are entered in mixed
case or lowercase.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, when you autostart WNAP, specify the two parameters
in uppercase as shown here:

   "wnap /USER:<username> /PWD:<password>" (without the quotation
   marks)

NOTE: The arguments that you enter for USER and PWD do not need to be uppercase.

The Wnap.exe program has been updated to correctly parse these parameters in all
cases.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 3.0 and 3.0 Service
Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
