SUMMARY
=======

You can create 35 millimeter (mm) slides by using a desktop film recorder or by
creating a file for a service bureau. A service bureau can transform your
electronic slides into 35 mm slides. This article lists several items to keep in
mind when you create a presentation that you intend to turn into 35 mm slides.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you create a presentation that you intend to turn into 35 mm slides, keep
the following items in mind:

1. Set the page layout to 35 mm before you create your presentation. See the
   "Changing Page Layout" section later in this article.

2. Avoid using pattern fills with contrasting colors. If you use pattern fills
   with contrasting colors, your images may contain horizontal white lines in
   the filled object or background.

3. Avoid using the diagonal and center burst gradient fills, especially when
   they have extreme color ranges such as red to yellow. Some film recorders may
   not be able to render the fill correctly, causing a "block-shaped" or
   "jagged" pattern in the fill.

4. Avoid using custom texture fills that exhibit the problems noted in items 2
   and 3 above.

5. Avoid using bitmaps that have multiple color changes in small regions of the
   image. They may not render correctly.

Changing Page Layout
--------------------

To change the page layout, follow these steps:

1. On the File menu, click Page Setup.

2. In the Slides Sized For list, click 35 mm.

3. Click OK.

NOTE: Make sure that all the text and graphics in your slide are at least 1/2
inch (or 1 centimeter) from the edge of the slide (as measured by the PowerPoint
rulers) to avoid being hidden due to irregularities in slide mounting.
