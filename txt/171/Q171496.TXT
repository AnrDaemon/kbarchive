Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic 5.0.

2. Add a new module to the project.

3. Inside this module, cut and paste the following code:

         Option Explicit

         Type config_rec
           cnf_sync_byte As Integer
           cnf_sysout    As String * 8
           cnf_mode      As String * 8
           cnf_period    As Integer
           cnf_cmp_print As Integer
           cnf_version   As String * 7
           cnf_prog_id   As Integer
           cnf_cond_code As Integer
           cnf_parity    As Integer
         End Type

         Sub TestFile(Config As config_rec)

           Dim FileNum As Integer
           Dim cnfgfile As String

           FileNum = FreeFile

           cnfgfile = "Test.Dat"

           On Error GoTo WriteErrHandler

           Open cnfgfile For Binary As FileNum
           Put #FileNum, 1, Config
           Close #FileNum

           Open cnfgfile For Binary Access Read As FileNum
           Get #FileNum, 1, Config

           Close #FileNum

           Exit Sub

           WriteErrHandler:
               MsgBox "Error : " & Err & " (" & Error & ")"

         End Sub

4. Add a CommandButton to Form1.

5. In the CommandButton's click event, add the following code:

         Dim Config As config_rec
         TestFile Config

6. Save and run project. There will be an error, and a MsgBox will pop up with
   the error number (52) and message (Bad File Name Or File Number).
