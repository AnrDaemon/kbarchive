SYMPTOMS
========

When you specify Default.asp (or any .asp file) as your default document in
Internet Information Server (IIS), you will get an error message if you do not
have Read access specified for the root virtual directory.

CAUSE
=====

IIS assumes that the default document is going to be read, not executed so the
Read permission is necessary for the default document in the root directory to
be interpreted correctly.

WORKAROUND
==========

Apply both Read and Execute rights to the root virtual directory in Internet
Service Manager.

WARNING: Placing both Read and Execute rights on the root directory specifies
that all files in the root can be executed. Take caution placing scripts and
executables in the directory if you have enabled the execute right for the
directory.
