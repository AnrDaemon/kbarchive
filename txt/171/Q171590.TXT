======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During an upgrade from Windows NT version 3.51 to Windows NT version 4.0, the
following fatal error message may be displayed:

   An error has been encountered that prevents Setup from continuing. Setup was
   unable to initialize licensing components. The specific error code is 127.

This error will usually occur during the reboot into the graphical user interface
(GUI) portion of Setup.

CAUSE
=====

During the upgrade process, the file Liccpa.cpl was not updated and the upgrade
will fail without it.


RESOLUTION
==========

Replacing the Liccpa.cpl file located in the %SystemRoot%\System32 directory
with the one from the Windows NT 4.0 CD will allow the upgrade to continue.


If the File System is File Allocation Table (FAT)
-------------------------------------------------

If the file system is FAT, perform the following steps:

1. Start your computer in MS-DOS mode, or another operating system if present,
   and replace the Liccpa.cpl file in the System32 directory with the one from
   the Windows NT 4.0 CD.

2. Restart the computer, and the upgrade process should continue from where it
   had stopped.

If the File System is NTFS
--------------------------

If the file system is NTFS, perform the following steps:

1. Create a new directory and install a parallel copy of Windows NT in this new
   directory.

2. Boot into this parallel copy of Windows NT, and copy the Liccpa.cpl file in
   the System32 directory to the System32 directory of the original installation
   of Windows NT.

3. Restart the computer, and select the original copy of Windows NT from the
   Boot.ini menu. The upgrade process should continue from where it stopped.
