TITLE   :WD97: Skip Numbering and Stop Numbering Not on Shortcut Menu
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui word97 kbnumbering

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you right-click on a numbered paragraph in Microsoft Word 97, the Skip
Numbering and Stop Numbering commands are no longer available on the shortcut
menu.

This is a change from earlier versions of Word, in which these options are
available on the shortcut menu.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. The Skip Numbering and Stop Numbering commands are
no longer needed because the Numbering button on the Formatting toolbar provides
equivalent functionality.

WORKAROUND
==========

How to Remove Numbering from a Numbered Item
--------------------------------------------

To perform the equivalent of the Skip Numbering command, use either of the
following methods:

1. Place the insertion point within the numbered item.

2. On the Formatting toolbar, click Numbering to remove the number.

   -or-

3. Place the insertion point at the beginning of the numbered item.

4. Press BACKSPACE to remove the number.

Word removes both the number and the indent from the paragraph. To retain the
indent, place the insertion point at the beginning of the paragraph and press
TAB.

How to Stop the Numbering of Numbered Items
-------------------------------------------

To perform the equivalent of the Stop Numbering command, follow these steps:

1. Remove the numbering from the chosen item as described in the "How To Remove
   Numbering from a Numbered Item" section of this article.

2. Right-click the numbered item for which you want to change numbering.

3. On the shortcut menu, click Bullets and Numbering.

4. Click to select Restart Numbering.

   -or-

   To specify a starting number other than one, click Customize, change the Start
   At number, and then click OK.

How to Add the Skip Numbering Command to the Shortcut Menu
----------------------------------------------------------

You can add the Skip Numbering command to the shortcut menu for numbered
paragraphs. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Customize.

2. On the Toolbars tab, scroll to the bottom of the list and click to select the
   Shortcut Menus check box.

   NOTE: A Shortcut Menus toolbar is displayed.

3. Click the Commands tab.

4. Under Categories, click to select All Commands.

5. Under Commands, click to select SkipNumbering, and then drag SkipNumbering to
   the Text menu on the Shortcut Menus toolbar. In the Text menu, point to Lists
   and then drop SkipNumbering into position on the shortcut menu.

   NOTE: Because Word may not always use the Lists shortcut menu, you may also
   want to add SkipNumbering to the Spelling shortcut menu.

6. In the Customize dialog box, click Close.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In earlier versions of Word, the Stop Numbering command (RemoveBulletsNumbers)
removes numbering from the selected paragraphs, and then restarts numbering at
one for the next numbered paragraph. In Word 97, the equivalent command does not
restart numbering at one, but continues the previous numbering sequence.
