MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have an extremely large UDT, reading valid data into it using the Get
statement may be compromised due to an Ansi/Unicode translation error.

This error occurs when reading in the UDT and translating it from Ansi to
Unicode.

In order for this bug to occur, the UDT is usually very large, most likely
containing many nested levels and arrays.
