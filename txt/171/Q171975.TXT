======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for Macintosh 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to view an article in Bookshelf 98, you may notice a long pause
as the CD-ROM drive makes strange noises, and you may receive one of the
following error messages:

    - Cannot open articles file.

    - Cannot open books file.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if your CD-ROM drive has problems reading the Bookshelf
CD-ROM.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, make sure your CD-ROM drive is able to access all of the
files on the Bookshelf CD-ROM. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Examine the silver side of the Bookshelf CD. If you see any noticeable
   scratches, the compact disc may be damaged.

   If you think you have a damaged compact disc, you can exchange it. If your
   local retailer will not exchange the damaged CD-ROM, contact Microsoft Sales
   at 800-360-7561 to obtain a replacement CD-ROM. You can also order it online
   at:

   If the new CD-ROM also has the same problem, your CD-ROM drive may not be able
   to access all of the files on the Bookshelf CD-ROM.

2. Clean the Bookshelf CD-ROM. To do this, use a CD-ROM cleaning kit, or gently
   wipe the silver side of the CD-ROM with a soft, lint-free cotton cloth. Do
   not use paper cloth which can scratch the plastic and leave streaks. When you
   clean the CD-ROM, wipe from the center of the disc outward; do not use a
   circular motion.

3. Verify that other CD-ROM programs function properly on your computer.
