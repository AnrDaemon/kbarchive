SYMPTOMS
========

If a Tabstrip control resides on a form with other controls, the Properties
dialog for the Tabstrip may inadvertently appear at run-time.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem has been corrected with the version of
COMCTL32.OCX that ships with Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Properties dialogs for controls should be available only at design time.
However, if you use the Click event of the Tabstrip control to set the focus to
another control on the form and then double-click the work area of the Tabstrip,
the Property dialog for the TabStrip will appear.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new project.

2. Add a Tabstrip control to Form1.

3. Add a TextBox control to Form1.

4. In the Click event of Tabstrip1 add the following code.

         Text1.setfocus.

5. Press the F5 key to run the program.

6. Click once on the tab of TabStrip1.

7. Double-click on the work area of TabSrip1.

   The Properties dialog appears as if you are in design mode.
