======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to open or save a form containing an SSTab control may cause Visual
Basic to terminate with one of the following errors:

   "VB5 caused an invalid page fault in module TABCTL32.OCX at 0137:212fef0b"

   -or-

   "VB5 caused an invalid page fault in module OLEAUT32.DLL at 0137:653468ec"

   -or-

   "VB5.exe Exception: Access violation (if using Windows NT or Windows 2000)"

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the form (.frm file) contains incorrect information
for the SSTab's child controls. This problem should only occur when the .frm
file has been incorrectly edited outside of Visual Basic (such as with a text
editor), or if the .frm file is otherwise corrupt.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service
Pack 2.

For more information on the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q170365 : INFO: Visual Studio 97 Service Packs - What, Where, and Why

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new "Standard EXE" project in Visual Basic 5.0.

2. Choose Components from the Project menu and select "Microsoft Tabbed Dialog
   Control 5.0."

3. Place an SSTab control on Form1.

4. Add two TextBox controls (Text1, Text2) to Tab 0.

5. Add two TextBox controls (Text3, Text4) to Tab 1.

6. Save the project (Form1.frm and Project1.vbp).

7. Exit Visual Basic.

8. Start Notepad and open Form1.frm.

9. Delete the following lines from Form1.frm:

         Tab(0).Control(1)=   "Text2"
         Tab(0).Control(1).Enabled=   0   'False
         ...
         Tab(1).Control(1)=   "Text4"
         Tab(1).Control(1).Enabled=   0   'False
         ...
         Begin VB.TextBox Text4
            Height          =   495
            Left            =   840
            TabIndex        =   4
            Text            =   "Text4"
            Top             =   1200
            Width           =   2775
         End
         ...
         Begin VB.TextBox Text2
            Height          =   495
            Left            =   -74160
            TabIndex        =   2
            Text            =   "Text2"
            Top             =   1200
            Width           =   2055

         End

10. Save Form1.frm and close Notepad.

11. Restart Visual Basic and open Project1.vbp. Note that an error occurs.

These steps will also reproduce the problem if you create the original project in
Visual Basic 4.0, edit the .frm file, then open the project in Visual Basic 5.0.
In this case, the problem will occur when attempting to save the form.
