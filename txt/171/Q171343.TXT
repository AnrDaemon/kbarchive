SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to remove Web server or file location entries that
appear in the "Web Server or File Location" list in the Open FrontPage Web
dialog box (File menu).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows Versions
----------------

To delete Web server or file location entries that appear in the Open FrontPage
Web dialog box, edit the Fpexplor.ini file and modify the [Recently Opened
Servers] section. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the Windows Start menu, point to Programs, and then click Windows
   Explorer.

2. In the Windows folder, double-click the Fpexplor.ini file.

3. Locate the [Recently Opened Servers] section in the Fpexplor.ini file.

4. Delete the line that contains the Web server you do not want to be listed in
   the "Web Server or File Location" list in the Open FrontPage Web dialog box.
   For example, if the [Recently Opened Servers] section of the Fpexplor.ini
   file looks like this:

      [Recently Opened Servers]
      Recent Server Count=4
      WebServer0=file:///c:/temp
      WebServer1=carboncopy
      WebServer2=production_Web
      WebServer3=finance_Web

   delete the Web that you do not want. For example, delete the
   WebServer2=production_Web line so that the [Recently Opened Servers] section
   looks like this:

      [Recently Opened Servers]
      Recent Server Count=4
      WebServer0=file:///c:/temp
      WebServer1=carboncopy
      WebServer3=finance_Web

5. Renumber the WebServer entries so that the first entry is WebServer0 and each
   subsequent entry increments by one. Change the Recent Server Count value to
   equal the number of servers listed in this section. For example, the
   [Recently Opened Servers] section of the Fpexplor.ini file should look like
   this:

      [Recently Opened Servers]
      Recent Server Count=3
      WebServer0=file:///c:/temp
      WebServer1=carboncopy
      WebServer2=finance_Web

6. Save and close the file.

Macintosh Version
-----------------

To remove the Web server entries, follow these steps:

1. Open the System Folder folder.

2. Open the Preferences folder.

3. Delete the FrontPage Explorer Preferences file.

   All Web server entries, except the default hard disk, will be removed from the
   "Web Server or File Location" list.
