KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to save an HTML file from Microsoft Word 97 for Windows to a
Novell NetWare server or to an operating system that either does not use long
file names or is set to use only 8.3 file names (file names with eight
characters and a three letter extension), you will receive the following error
message:

   The specified path is invalid.


CAUSE
=====

By default, Microsoft Word uses an .html file name extension for HTML- formatted
documents. If the server does not have OS/2 or long file name space support
installed, you will receive this error message.

WORKAROUND
==========

Before clicking OK to save the file, delete the "l" from the ".html" file name
extension (that is, change ".html" to ".htm"). Files with an .htm extension are
still recognized as HTML files and can be saved to the server successfully.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, Novell NetWare servers support MS-DOS file names only. Support for
long file names is optional and can be added by an administrator.

NetWare is manufactured by Novell, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
