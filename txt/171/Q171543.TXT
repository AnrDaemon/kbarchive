The information in this article applies to:

 - The C Run-Time (CRT), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0sp1 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0sp1 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0sp2 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0sp2 
    - Microsoft Visual Studio versions 97, 97sp1, 97sp2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The C Run-time (CRT) Library function _getmbcp is supposed to return 0 if a
single-byte code page is in use. However, this is not true with the CRT Library
shipped with Visual C++ 5.0 in Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 1 and Service Pack
2. The function returns the current code page value irrespective of whether it
is a single byte or multi byte code page. This behavior breaks existing programs
that were using this call primarily to query whether a single-byte code page is
active.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service
Pack 3.

     return 0;
   }
