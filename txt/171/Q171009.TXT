 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to delete a custom form if there are multiple forms
with the same name in a public folder.

If a custom form is created with the same name as an existing form, the duplicate
will appear in the public folder. Also, the user will have a duplicate entry
when creating a new form. Each entry will call a separate form.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To resolve this, on the Tools menu, click Options. Click Exchange Server, and
click Manage Forms. Click Set, and point to the public folder. Delete the bottom
instance of the duplicate; it is the older one.
