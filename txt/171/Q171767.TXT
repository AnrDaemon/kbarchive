TITLE   :OS/2 Clients Do Not Receive Print Notification

The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

When you print from an OS/2 client computer to a printer on a Windows NT server,
the user does not receive a Print Notification pop-up message, although the user
is able to send network pop-up messages to the server from other clients on the
local network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The client computer is only running TCP/IP. The user can send network pop- up
commands between computers on the local subnet only. The OS/2 Messenger service
is compatible with Microsoft's Messenger service, but in a TCP/IP network, it
depends on name resolution. OS/2 Warp is not a WINS client and, therefor, the
user name and workstation name are not registered in the WINS database.

If the users do not roam between workstations, static entries can be created in
the WINS database to make this work properly. Both the workstation name and the
user name, if different, should be entered. It should be noted that Print
Notification uses the sender's user name as the pop-up destination, not the
workstation name.
