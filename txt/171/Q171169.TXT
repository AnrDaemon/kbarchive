TITLE   :XADM: Address Book Views in Exchange Server 4.0 Servers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:Windows:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In a mixed environment of servers running both Microsoft Exchange Server version
4.0 and 5.0, Exchange clients connecting to the version 4.0 servers will be able
to see Address Book View containers, but will not be able to view the recipients
within the containers. In addition, Address Book Views that have been configured
to be hidden from the Microsoft Exchange client will be visible in clients
connected to the version 4.0 servers.

CAUSE
=====

The behavior above occurs when version 4.0 servers obtain the Address Book Views
through replication with version 5.0 servers. The ability to configure and use
custom Address Book Views is a new feature which is introduced in Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0 and is not supported on Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

To configure the Address Book Views, use version 5.0 of the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator program. To take advantage of the Address Book Views feature on
version 4.0 servers, you must upgrade them to Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.0.
