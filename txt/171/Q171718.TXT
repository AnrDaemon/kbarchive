SYMPTOMS
========

In FrontPage Editor, when you edit the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) source
of a page that contains a WebBot Include component, which contains an image map,
you receive the following error message:

   The contents of a WebBot Component have been modified. These contents will be
   overwritten when you save this page.

In addition, FrontPage Editor creates another WebBot Include component that
contains brackets ([]) formatted in italic. None of the changes you made are
saved.

RESOLUTION
==========

To edit the HTML code on a page that contains an included image map, use either
of the following methods.

Method 1: Modify the WebBot Include Component

1. Select the WebBot Include component that contains the image map.

2. On the Edit menu, click Cut.

3. On the View menu, click HTML.

4. Make the changes you want to your HTML source and then click OK.

5. On the Edit menu, click Paste.

Method 2: Modify the Web Page in a Text Editor
----------------------------------------------

1. In FrontPage Explorer, right-click the file that contains the WebBot Include
   component (Windows) or press CONTROL and click the page that contains the
   WebBot Include Component (Power Macintosh). Click Open With on the menu that
   appears.

2. From the Editor list, click Text Editor (Windows) or Simple Text (Power
   Macintosh).

3. Make the changes you want. Save and close the file.

   FrontPage will reimport the file and update it within the Web.
