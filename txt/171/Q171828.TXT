Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run Visual Basic or, if Visual Basic is already running, choose New Project
   from the File menu (ALT, F, N). Form1 is created by default.

2. Place an Internet Transfer Control (Inet1) on Form1 and add the following
   code:

         Private Sub Inet1_StateChanged(ByVal State As Integer)
            Dim strMess As String ' Message variable.
            Select Case State
            ' ... Other cases not shown.
            Case icError  ' 11
              ' Get the Text of the error.
            strMess = "ErrorCode: " & Inet1.ResponseCode & " : " &
                                                Inet1.ResponseInfo
            End Select
         End Sub
     

3. Place a CommandButton (Command1) on Form1 and add the following code:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
              ' download FTP files
              Dim b() As Byte
              Dim strURL As String

              ' Set the strURL to a valid address.
              strURL = "FTP://GenericServer/FileToDownload.bin"

              ' Retrieve the file as a byte array.
              b() = Inet1.OpenURL(strURL, icByteArray)

              ' ** create directory on your machine with directory target
              Open "C:\Target\FileToDownload.bin" For Binary Access _
              Write As #1
              Put #1, , b()
              Close #1
          End Sub
      

4. From the Run menu, choose Start (ALT, R, S), or press the F5 key to run the
   program. Press the Command1 button to see the error when downloading the
   file.
