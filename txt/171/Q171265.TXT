TITLE   :Unable to Uninstall Cluster Administrator Tool
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Cluster Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install only the Cluster Administrator tool for Microsoft Cluster Server
(MSCS) version 1.0 on a non-clustered computer, there is no option to uninstall
the Cluster Administrator application.

CAUSE
=====

The Cluster Administrator application is an addition to the existing tool set
for administrators as located in the Administrative Tools (Common) group. You
may use this application for remote administration of Microsoft Clusters. The
setup program for MSCS provides the ability to uninstall the Cluster Server
portion of the product only. This is by design.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you want to remove the Cluster Administrator application from the common
Administrative Tools group, you may do the following:

NOTE: Do not use this procedure on a server that participates in a cluster. This
procedure is for removing the Cluster Administrator application from a system in
which only the application was installed.

1. Click Start and then click Settings.

2. Click Taskbar.

3. Click the Start Menu Programs tab.

4. Click Advanced.

5. In the Explorer window, locate the following directory:

   Profiles\All Users\Start Menu\Programs

6. Select Administrative Tools (Common).

7. To the right, observe the items that belong to the Administrative Tools
   (Common) group. Select Cluster Administrator and press the DELETE key.

8. Locate and remove the %SystemRoot%\Cluster directory. The cluster directory
   will be located under the directory where Windows NT was installed, unless
   you chose a different installation path with the MSCS setup program.

9. Close the Explorer window.

10. Click OK to close the Taskbar Properties window.
