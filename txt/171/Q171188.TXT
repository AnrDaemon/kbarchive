The information in this article applies to:

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

Computers that start multiple services or run lengthy logon scripts may receive
the following error if connected to a busy network:

   "A slow network connection has been detected. Would you like to download your
   profile or use the locally stored copy?"

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two ways currently available to alter the default Slow Link Timeout
value to keep this message from appearing on your screen.

Method 1
--------

You can alter the default Slow Link Timeout value for your Windows NT Workstation
clients by using the System Policy Editor. To do this, perform the following
steps:

1. Start System Policy Editor (Poledit.exe).

2. From the File menu, click Open Registry.

3. Click Local Machine.

4. Click Windows NT User Profiles.

5. Click to select the Check box for Slow network connection timeout.

Method 2
--------

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serous problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

If you wish to alter this value in the registry, perform the following steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and find the following subkey:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\WinLogon

2. From the Edit menu, click Add Value and type SlowLinkTimeOut for the Value
   Name. For DataType: leave at REG_DWORD. This value is in milliseconds (1,000
   per second.) The minimum value is 0, the maximum is 120,000 (120 seconds) and
   the default is 2,000 (2 seconds.)
