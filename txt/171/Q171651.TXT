TITLE   :Running a Batch or Command File from Windows NT Explorer Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to run a .bat or .cmd file from Explorer or by using the Run
command on the Start menu, you see a command window open and then close
immediately. If you could read the message it would say:

   This command is not recognized as an internal or external command.

The .bat or .cmd file will work fine if you open a command prompt window, go to
the directory, and run the file.

CAUSE
=====

The .bat or .cmd file is located in a directory that has one of the following
characters in the directory name or a parent directory name:

   @ & ^ ( )

NOTE: If you use the Run command on the Start menu, the at symbol (@) does not
cause this problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the parent directory name so that it does not use one of those
characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
