To work around this problem, modify the macro to insert the text string into the
document, select it, add the selection as an AutoText entry, and then remove the
text string. The following sample Visual Basic for Applications macro
demonstrates this procedure:

      Sub AutoTextEntryExample()
         Dim sATName As String
         Dim sATEntry As String
         Dim sATNewEntry As AutoTextEntry

         ' Sample AutoText Entry Name.
         sATName = "ExampleAutoTextEntryName"
         ' Sample AutoText Entry Text of 500 characters.
         sATEntry = String(500, "A")

         If Documents.Count = 0 Then Documents.Add
         If Len(sATEntry) < 256 Then
            ' If the length of the text is less than 256 characters,
            ' add it as a new AutoText Entry.
            Selection.Range.Collapse
            Set sATNewEntry = NormalTemplate.AutoTextEntries.Add _
            (Name:=sATName, Range:=Selection.Range)
            sATNewEntry.Value = sATEntry
         Else
            ' If the length of the text is greater than 255 characters,
            ' insert it into the active document and add it as a new
            ' AutoText Entry.
            With Selection.Range
               .Collapse
               .Text = sATEntry
               .Select
               NormalTemplate.AutoTextEntries.Add _
                  Name:=sATName, Range:=Selection.Range
               .Delete
            End With
         End If
      End Sub
