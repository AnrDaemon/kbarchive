PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp500 kbVS97sp2fix kbGrpDSVB kbvbp500sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Visual Basic reports an error loading the <project>.vbp files when loading
a project group from the root directory of the drive where Visual Basic is
installed.

CAUSE
=====

Visual Basic is looking in the default directory (where VB5.exe was launched).
It should look in the same directory as the .VBG file when no path info is
stored in the .VBG file, but it does not.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2 (SP2) or save the project to any
location except the root directory of the drive where Visual Basic 5.0 is
installed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service
Pack 2.

For more information on the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
