MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE in Visual Basic 5.0.

2. Maximize the IDE.

3. Minimize the IDE.

4. Click the Visual Basic Icon in TaskBar to restore it.

5. Restore the IDE (middle button on upper-right of the IDE).

6. Resize the main IDE window so that it is in mid-screen and much smaller than
   the screen.

7. Minimize the IDE.

8. Click the Visual Basic Icon in TaskBar to restore it. Note that you now have
   two Visual Basic Title bars: one on the IDE and another at the top of the
   screen in the maximized position.

   NOTE 1: When you perform step #7, Visual Basic appears to maximize the top of
   the IDE window briefly before minimizing. However, only the top of the window
   is maximized and it doesn't appear as if the process finishes before the
   entire window is minimized. This is where the left- over repaint is coming
   from. You can observe this behavior particularly on slower video cards.

   NOTE 2: This bug occurs no matter how many MDI child windows you have opened
   within the Visual Basic IDE.
