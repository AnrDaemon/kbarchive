TITLE   :Windows 95 Domain Password Change Doesn't Change Local Password
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a Windows 95 system password expires, and you change the password using the
SNA Server Windows 95 client, the password only changes through the SNA Server
computer. The next logon attempt will fail because the local system password
remains the same as the old one.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0 Service
Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K


MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, the SNA Server Windows 95 client changes passwords by
using the Windows 95 password change function instead of relying on the SNA
Server computer. SNA Server Windows 95 client will automatically start the
connection with the system password.
