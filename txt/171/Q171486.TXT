Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project.

2. Under Project | Components, add all of the intrinsic controls and all other
   Microsoft controls to the project.

3. Whether you add controls to the form by double-clicking them or by clicking
   them and drawing them on the form, the bug will occur because it depends upon
   clicking a control on the Toolbar.

4. An Application Error or an Access Violation similar to the following is
   likely to occur within a few minutes of continually adding controls:

   "The instruction at <some address> referenced memory at <some
   address>. The memory could not be read."
