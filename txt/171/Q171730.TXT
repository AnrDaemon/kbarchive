TITLE   :WD97: How to Retain the Template View in the New Dialog Box
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbwordvba

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you change the template view (large icons, list, or details) in the New
dialog box (on the File menu, click New), the selected view will be retained for
the current session of Microsoft Word. When you close Word, the view reverts to
large icons.

CAUSE
=====

By default, the New dialog box for all Microsoft Office 97 programs uses the
large icon view.

WORKAROUND
==========

Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including, but
not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a
particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are provided 'as
is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in all situations.
While Microsoft support professionals can help explain the functionality of a
particular macro, they will not modify these examples to provide added
functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to consult one
of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution Providers offer a wide range of
fee-based services, including creating custom macros. For more information about
Microsoft Solution Providers, call Microsoft Customer Information Service at
(800) 426-9400.

The following sample Visual Basic for Applications macro provides a method you
can use to set the view automatically each time you access the New dialog box.

The example macro uses the SendKeys statement to send the required keystroke
combination for switching views. The keystrokes for changing the view in the New
dialog box are listed in the following table.

   Press this       To display the files this way
   -----------------------------------------------

   ALT+1            Large Icons
   ALT+2            List
   Alt+3            Details

Sample Macro
------------

      Sub FileNew()
         SendKeys ("%3") ' To change the type of view, change this number.
         Dialogs(wdDialogFileNew).Show
      End Sub

In this example, the New dialog box will be displayed with details (ALT+3)
selected for the template view. To change the macro so that the dialog box
displays the templates in list view, change the number 3 to the number 2.

NOTE: The macro MUST be called FileNew for this example to work when you click
New on the File menu.
