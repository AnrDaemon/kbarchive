SUMMARY
=======

In order to keep a FoxISAPI application available over your intranet or the
Internet when no one is logged on to the NT server, you must make a change to
the DCOMCNFG utility for the registered application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If clients can access your FoxISAPI Web pages only when someone is logged into
the NT server, you need to make the following change to the DCOMCNFG utility:

1. Run the DCOMCNFG utility by clicking Run on the Start menu.

2. Highlight your FoxISAPI object in the list of registered objects.

3. Click Properties.

4. Click the Identity tab.

5. Click "The launching user."

6. Click OK on the Properties sheet.

7. Click OK on the DCOMCNFG dialog box.

You should now be able to logoff of Windows NT and the clients should be able to
access the FoxISAPI page.

NOTE: An alternative to using "The launching user" is to specify a specific user
in the "This user:" area of the Identity tab.
