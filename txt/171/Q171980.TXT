SUMMARY
=======

This article demonstrates how to play a MIDI (.MID) file from Visual Basic using
the WIN 32 API call named mciSendString.

NOTE: You can use the MCI control to play a MIDI file; you don't need to use the
APIs.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start Visual Basic, or if Visual Basic is already running, click New Standard
   EXE Project on the File menu (ALT, F, N). Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a CommandButton (Command1) to Form1.

3. Add the following code to the Command1_Click event of Form1:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
         Dim ret As Integer

            ' The following will open the sequencer with the CANYON.MID
            ' file. Canyon is the device_id.

            ret = mciSendString( _
              "open " & Song & " type sequencer alias canyon", _
              0&, 0, 0)

            ' The wait tells the MCI command to complete before returning
            ' control to the application.

            ret = mciSendString("play canyon wait", 0&, 0, 0)

            ' Close CANYON.MID file and sequencer device

            ret = mciSendString("close canyon", 0&, 0, 0)

         End Sub

4. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form1.

         Private Declare Function mciSendString Lib "winmm.dll" Alias _
            "mciSendStringA" (ByVal lpstrCommand As String, ByVal  _
            lpstrReturnString As Any, ByVal uReturnLength As Long, ByVal _
            hwndCallback As Long) As Long

         ' Modify the value of the constant "Song" with your path
               ' to "canyon.mid".
               Private Const Song As String = "C:\Windows\Media\Canyon.MID"

5. On the Run menu, click Start (ALT, R, S) or press the F5 key to run the
   program.
