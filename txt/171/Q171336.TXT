PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view a document containing font animation, the line of text at the
bottom of the document window may not show the font animation.

This problem may occur in any view.

CAUSE
=====

If the last line of text is partially obscured by the document window, then it
will not show the font animation. This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Word 97, the following font animation effects are available:

 - Blinking Background

 - Las Vegas Lights

 - Marching Black Ants

 - Marching Red Ants

 - Shimmer

 - Sparkle Text

To format your text with font animation, follow these steps:

1. In the Word document, select the text to apply animation to.

2. On the Format menu, click Font.

3. Click to select the Animation tab.

4. Under Animations, click to select the desired animation, and then click OK.

NOTE: If you click Default on the Animation tab, you are prompted with the
following message:

   Do you want to change the default font to <font name>, <font
   animation>?

   This change will affect all new documents based on the NORMAL
   template.

If you click Yes, the default font uses the animation effect in all new Word
documents.

If you click No, the default font does not change, and does not use the animation
effect.
