TITLE   :Webhits.exe Error Message: General Access Denied
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Webhits.exe is in use, you may see the following error message:

   General Access Denied.

You can also get the above error message if you have all of your virtual servers
with IP addresses, and you do not have a virtual server with an unassigned
address.

CAUSE
=====

This can be due to a mismatch in permissions between Webhits.exe and the files
that Webhits.exe is opening. You may be able to see the files but Webhits.exe
may have difficulty opening the file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

Check the permissions on the drive:\InetPub\scripts\srchadm\webhits.exe file.

Make sure that if the permissions are applied to the .idq file, the same
permissions apply to the Webhits.exe file.
