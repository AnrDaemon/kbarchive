SUMMARY
=======

If you uninstall the Telephony application programming interface (TAPI) version
2.1 driver set or the TAPI 2.1 Software Developer Kit (SDK), some files may not
be replaced with the original versions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

TAPI 2.1, in Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0, requires Service Pack 3 or later.
If you uninstall TAPI 2.1, you need to reapply the service pack before
restarting. Failure to reapply the service pack may result in mismatched
versions of TAPI-related files and could lead to other problems.

NOTE: When you apply Service Pack 3, the update program indicates that the
service pack needs to be reapplied if you change or add any components.

The recommended uninstall procedure for TAPI 2.1 is as follows:

1. Locate the Remtapin.inf file for Windows NT. More information about this file
   may be found in the Readme.txt file that came with TAPI 2.1.

2. Right-click the file, then click Install.

3. Follow the directions given during the uninstall process. This procedure will
   reinstall the original TAPI system from the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 CD.

4. Reapply Service Pack 3 for Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 before
   restarting.
