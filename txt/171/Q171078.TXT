TITLE   :SnaBase Fails to Start Using Novell NetWare Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

SnaBase stops responding on startup, without displaying an error if SNA Server
is configured to use NetWare Directory Services (NDS) with the Novell NetWare
client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT SNA Server version
3.0 Server Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version
3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on
the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 1 does not support NDS operation over the
Novell NetWare client, a fix for SNA Server 3.0 SP1 is available from Microsoft
to correct this SnaBase problem. With this update applied, SNA Server checks the
workstation type before it tries to register SnaBase with NDS. SNA Server will
log an error if the workstation type is Novell.
