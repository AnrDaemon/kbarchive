Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Visual Basic 5.0 Standard EXE project.

2. Add two controls to Form1.

3. Ensure that none of the controls is currently selected.

4. Press CTRL+A, or Edit | Select All to select both controls.

5. Press and hold either the CTRL or SHIFT keys.

6. Click and hold down the left-mouse button.

7. Release the CTRL or SHIFT key or release the left-mouse button.

8. Move the mouse and note the shadow of the controls.

9. Click and release the left-mouse button. An invalid page fault in Visual
   Basic results.

NOTE: This behavior can be avoided by selecting and moving the controls after
ensuring that at least one control has been selected. Additionally, use of the
ESC key can circumvent the invalid page fault.
