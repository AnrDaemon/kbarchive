Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Form.

2. Add a Microsoft Web Browser Control to the form and set its properties as
   follows:

      Name: WBCtrl1
      Refresh: NODEFAULT
      Init: This.Navigate("www.microsoft.com")

3. Add a TextBox to the Form. The TextBox will be used to enter the URLs you
   want to connect to. Add the following code to the Valid event of this
   TextBox:

         IF !EMPTY(This.Value)
            ThisForm.WBCtrl1.Navigate(This.Value)
         ENDIF

4. Run the form, type a valid URL into the TexBox, and then hit the ENTER key to
   go to and display the URL. Note that repeating step 4 several times may cause
   Visual FoxPro to crash.
