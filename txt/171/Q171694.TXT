SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the difference between the Recycle Bin and the Recycler
folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you delete a file in Windows NT Explorer or My Computer, the file is stored
in the Recycle Bin. The file remains in the Recycle Bin until you empty the
Recycle Bin or restore the file.

The Recycler folder is used only on NTFS partitions. The Recycler folder contains
a Recycle Bin for each user that logs on to the computer, sorted by their
security identifier (SID).

For additional information about the Recycle Bin, please see the following
