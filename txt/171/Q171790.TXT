TITLE   :Time Incorrect After Restarting Multiprocessor System
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a multiprocessor computer, if you synchronize the system time to an external
time source using the Date/Time tool in Control Panel, and then restart your
system, the system time will be slow by four to five seconds for every processor
after the first processor.

Example:

If you set the time on a 4-processor system, the system time will be 12-15
seconds slow (3 x 4-5 seconds). Note that the time loss is not cumulative; the
system will still be slow by the same amount after another restart unless the
time is changed again.

CAUSE
=====

During system initialization, the system starts by using only one processor. The
system time is retrieved from the system Real Time Clock (RTC) and loaded into
the system clock. Later in the initialization process, the system clock timer is
halted for four to five seconds while each additional processor is configured.
This halting causes a time slip from the RTC value. When the time is written, it
is written to both the system clock and to the RTC.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, perform one of the following:

 - Synchronize the system time with an external source and restart. Determine
   how much time the system lost during startup, and set the system time fast by
   this amount. After a restart, the time should be correct. You will need to
   repeat this procedure every time the system time is set.

 - Run the time service provided in the resource kit. This will keep a group of
   servers in sync with each other.


To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.


Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
