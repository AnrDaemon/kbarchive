KEYWORDS:kbVBp500 kbVS97sp2fix kbGrpDSVB kbvbp500sp2fix

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS

event does not fire as expected. The Resize event of the UserControl fires only
when made part of a control array.

beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service
Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps To Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project.

2. Add a UserControl to the project.

3. Add the following code to the Resize event of the UserControl:

         Private Sub UserControl_Resize()
             MsgBox "Resize"
         End Sub

4. Add an instance of the UserControl to Form1. Note that the Resize event
   triggers the first time.

5. Select the instance of the UserControl and click Copy on the Edit Menu.

6. Click Paste on the Edit menu. When asked if you want to make a control array,
   click No.

   NOTE: As long as you continue to copy and paste the control, the new controls
   are added without the Resize event firing (if they are not part of a control
   array).

7. Paste the control, and choose Yes when asked to make a control array.

   NOTE: Because the control is now part of a control array, the Resize event
   triggers correctly when added to the form.
