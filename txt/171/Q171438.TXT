======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Visual FoxPro does not support passing arrays by reference to OLE
objects.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Place the following code in a program file and add the program file to a
   project named OLETest. Compile the project into an OLE DLL or EXE named
   OLETest.

         DEFINE CLASS ARRAYTEST AS CUSTOM OLEPUBLIC
         NAME = "arraytest"

         PROCEDURE DOIT
            PARAMETER MYARRAY
            EXTERNAL ARRAY MYARRAY
            INSERT INTO foot (ONE,TWO,THREE,FOUR) VALUES ;
               (MYARRAY[1],MYARRAY[2],MYARRAY[3],MYARRAY[4])
            MYARRAY [1] = "100"
            MYARRAY [2] = "200"
            MYARRAY [3] = "300"
            MYARRAY [4] = "400"

            USE CURDIR() + "foot.dbf"
            INSERT INTO foot (ONE,TWO,THREE,FOUR) VALUES ;
               (MYARRAY[1],MYARRAY[2],MYARRAY[3],MYARRAY[4])
         ENDPROC

         PROCEDURE INIT
            SET UDFPARMS TO REFERENCE
            CREATE TABLE foot ;
               (ONE C(10),TWO C(10), THREE C(10), FOUR C(10))
         ENDPROC

         ENDDEFINE

2. After the OLE file is compiled, run the following code:

         CLEAR
         CLEAR ALL
         DIMENSION MYARRAY[4]
         MYARRAY(1) = "1"
         MYARRAY(2) = "2"
         MYARRAY(3) = "3"
         MYARRAY(4) = "4"
         OX = CREATEOBJECT("OLEtest.arraytest")
         OX.DOIT(@MYARRAY)
         ?OX.Name
         ?"MyArray from Calling Program"
         DISPLAY MEMORY LIKE MYARRAY
         RELEASE OX
         RELEASE MYARRAY
         USE foot
         BROWSE NOWAIT

3. Notice the first record of table "foot" contains the values placed in the
   array by the calling program. The second record contains the values PROCEDURE
   DOIT placed in the array. The DISPLAY MEMORY LIKE MYARRAY command, however,
   contains the original values of the array. Even though it appears that we are
   passing the array by reference to the OLE object, Microsoft Visual FoxPro is
   passing it by value.
