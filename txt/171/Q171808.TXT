MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In Visual Basic, create a new ActiveX control project. UserControl1 is
   created by default.

2. Add a CommandButton control to the UserControl and close the UserControl's
   design window.

3. Select File | Add Project to add a Standard Exe project. Form1 is created by
   default.

4. Select Project | Add MDI Form to add a MDI form. MDIForm1 is created by
   default.

5. Select Project | Add Form to add a regular form. Form2 is created by default.

6. Change the MDIChild property on both Form1 and Form2 to TRUE.

7. Add UserControl1 to Form1.

8. In the form_load event of Form1, place the following code:

         Private Sub Form_Load()
                   Me.Show
                   Form2.Show
               End Sub
     

9. Run the Project.

10. Size Form2 so that you can see Form1 (and the UserControl on it) in the
   background.

11. Click the CommandButton on the UserControl while Form2 has the focus. Note
   that the button presses but Form1 does not get the focus as it should.

12. Click the UserControl in an area other than where the CommandButton is. Note
   that Form1 now gets the focus.
