This behavior will only occur if a previous build of the ActiveX control is
canceled due to an incompatibility warning and then a subsequent build of the
ActiveX control is started.

1. Start a new ActiveX Control project in Visual Basic 5.0.

2. From the View menu, select Code.

3. Enter the following code in the General Declarations section of
