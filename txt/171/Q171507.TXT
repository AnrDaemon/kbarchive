SYMPTOMS
========

Visual Basic may cause a General Protection Fault (GPF) when you select multiple
controls on a form and choose Align/Lefts from the Format menu.

CAUSE
=====

One of the controls selected on the form handles a COM object incorrectly by
implementing IPersistStreamInit::Save and returning E_FAIL. This has been
reproduced with custom controls built with MFC, ATL, MarcWan Framework, and the
JavaVM.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2 (SP2).

STATUS
======
