TITLE   :Incorrect Data Printed When PDF File Used with AS/400 Printing
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain circumstances, the SNA Server print server may print incorrect
data for an AS/400 print job.

CAUSE
=====

When the SNA Server Virtual print engine is called from the 5250 Print provider
DLL with a zero-length string, it writes to the printer the contents of a random
piece of memory, of random length, instead of skipping the write command.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

   S E R V P A C K


MORE INFORMATION
================

The above mentioned behavior only appears when certain combinations of SCS codes
are received in a row, for example, two Form Feed controls, two Line Feed
controls, or a Form Feed and a Line Feed control and a PDF File is being used.
