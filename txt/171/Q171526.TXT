The TreeView Control does not paint correctly when the Enabled Property is set
to False. When the TreeView Enabled Property is set to False, the "text areas"

areas" are painted with one color and the lines leading to the "text areas" are
painted a different shade.

         End Sub

         Private Sub Form_Load()
           TreeView1.LineStyle = tvwRootLines
           'Add Node objects.
           Dim nodX As Node    ' Declare Node variable.
           'First node with 'Root' as text.
           Set nodX = TreeView1.Nodes.Add(, , "r", "Root")

           'Create three child Nodes of Node 1 ("Root").
           Set nodX = TreeView1.Nodes.Add("r", tvwChild, "child1","Child")

           Set nodX = TreeView1.Nodes.Add("r", tvwChild, "child2","Child")

           Set nodX = TreeView1.Nodes.Add("r", tvwChild, "child3","Child")
