MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new ActiveX Control Project (Project1) in Visual Basic 5.0.
   UserControl1 is created by default.

2. Set the BackColor property for UserControl1 to blue or any color other than
   gray.

3. Save Project1 and Make Project1.ocx.

4. From the File menu, select Add Project.

5. Double-click on Standard EXE. This project is named Project2 by default.

6. Close down the UserControl Window.

7. Click on the UserControl icon on the Toolbox and draw UserControl11 on Form1.

8. Save Project2 and Make EXE using default compile settings.

9. Copy Project1.OCX to Project1.CMP.

10. From the Project menu, select Project1 Properties. On the Component tab of
   the Project Properties dialog, check Remote Server Files, choose Project
   Compatibility under Version Compatibility, and set the file to project1.cmp
   by using the browse button or entering the fully-qualified path.

11. Add the following code to the General Declarations of the UserControl:

         Public Sub foo()
         End Sub

12. Make Project1.OCX.

13. Make Project2.EXE.

When you try to compile, you will get the following error message:

   "Class not registered. Looking for object with CLSID:
   {A0CB258A-70D4-11D0-8B96-00A0C903AA86}"

The Class ID entry in the braces will not match the entry on your machine.

If you click the OK button, you will get:

   "Error loading <filename>. A control could not be loaded due to load
   error. Continue?"

Click the Yes button.
