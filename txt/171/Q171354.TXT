SYMPTOMS

The values in the server configuration dialog box in WINS Manager automatically
change when other controls in the windows are selected.


RESOLUTION

The only work around to this issue at this time is to manually verify the proper
settings before you click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server version 4.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, if you have WINS Manager open to the Configuration dialog Box and
change any of the Renewal Interval values to a value higher than the Extinction
Interval or Extinction Timeout, then click on another control or press Tab, you
will notice that both of the Extinction values are changed to match the Renewal
Interval value.
