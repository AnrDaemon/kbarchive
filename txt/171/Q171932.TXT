SUMMARY
=======

Page 301 of the "Microsoft Windows 95 Help Authoring Kit" states that you can
compile Help files for Windows 3.x by using Win32s, or by restricting the Help
file to use features that are only available Help Compiler 3.0.

The Windows 95 Help Compiler included with this book creates Help files in the
Help Compiler 4.0 file format. You cannot use these files on Windows 3.1 systems
without Win32s; instead, you must compile these Help files with the Windows 3.1
Help Compiler.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows 3.1 Help Compiler, version 3.10.505, is available at no charge from
Microsoft in the compressed file Hc505.exe. This file also contains directions
to install the compiler to the practice directory.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

   Hc505.exe
   (http://download.microsoft.com/download/win31/Install/3.10.505/W31/EN-US/Hc505.exe)
