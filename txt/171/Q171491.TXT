The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the value of the mouse button is queried in the MouseUp event of the Tabbed
Dialog control, it always returns a value of 4. It should return a value of
either 1, 2, or 4.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem is fixed in the newer version of the Tabbed Dialog control
(TABCTL32.OCX) provided with Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2.

You can work around the problem by using a global variable that is set to the
value of Button in the MouseDown event, or using the MouseDown event that
reports the value of the mouse button correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service
Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION

The value of Button should indicate which button was pressed, as follows:

   control, you will see that the value displayed is always 4.
