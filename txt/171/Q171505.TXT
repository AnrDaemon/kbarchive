         Form3.show vbModal

5. Add the following code to the Form3_load event:

         Dim a, b
         Debug.print "Loading Form"

6. Add the following to the Form3_Unload event:

         Debug.print "Unloading Form"

7. Press the F5 key to start execution.

8. Press CTRL+BREAK to enter debug mode.
