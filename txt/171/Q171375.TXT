TITLE   :3270 Applet Does Not Return to a Normal State
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you close the 3270 Applet (Win3270.exe) while the application is in a
minimized or maximized state, you can no longer restore the window to normal.

CAUSE
=====

When creating the windows with a SetWindowPlacement(), the applet uses the
correct, restored window positions, but uses the saved window state. This causes
the restored window position to be lost, and on subsequent restores, the applet
is left in a maximized or minimized position.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server and Clients version
3.0 and Server Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, the window is created in a normal state, and then a
WM_SYSCOMMAND() message is posted with either SC_MAXIMIZE() or SC_MINIMIZE() if
necessary. Using this method, the normal positions are not lost. This has a
visible effect in that when the applet is started, the window appears briefly in
the restored position before going to the maximized or minimized state.
