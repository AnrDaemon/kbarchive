KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network versions 1.2, 1.3, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to read an e-mail message in MSN, The Microsoft Network, or
send an e-mail message from MSN, Microsoft Internet Mail may open and you may be
prompted to enter the names of your SMTP and POP3 mail servers.

You may also receive the following error message:

   The mail server name cannot be found. Please check your Internet Mail
   configuration, network connection and TCP/IP configuration and retry. If this
   persists, contact your LAN administrator or Internet provider.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Internet Explorer may be configured to use Internet Mail to send and
receive e-mail messages. Internet Mail and Outlook Express are not compatible
with MSN 2.0 or earlier.

RESOLUTION
==========

Configure Internet Explorer to use Windows Messaging or Microsoft Outlook to
send and receive e-mail messages. To do so, use the following steps:

1. Right-click the Internet icon on the desktop, and then click Properties.

2. Click the Programs tab.

3. In the Mail box, click Windows Messaging or Microsoft Outlook.

4. Click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Internet Mail and News requires an SMTP/POP3 mail server. MSN 2.0 does not
currently offer SMTP/POP3 mail services.

If you want to use Internet News and Mail or Outlook Express with MSN, you need
to upgrade to MSN version 2.5. For more information about this issue and about
installing the latest version of MSN, please see the following articles in the
