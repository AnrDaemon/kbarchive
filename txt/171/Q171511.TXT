PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp500 kbVS97sp2fix kbGrpDSVB kbvbp500sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the versions of Visual Basic listed at the beginning of this article, if you
have an SSTab control with nested container controls where the inner-most
container contains other controls, you may experience painting problems while in
design mode.

For example, on an SSTab control, if you have a Frame control (Frame2) within
another Frame control (Frame1), and Frame2 contains TextBox1, you may encounter
a situation where Frame2 and TextBox1 do not paint correctly in design mode.

CAUSE
=====

A form may exhibit this problem under the following circumstances:

 - The form consists of nested container controls (such as a PictureBox or a
   Frame) on an SSTab.

   - and -

 - The innermost container control holds other controls (such as a TextBox or an
   OptionButton).

   - and -

 - The form is not maximized.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service
Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new "Standard EXE" project.

2. Choose Components from the Project menu and select "Microsoft Tabbed Dialog
   Control 5.0." (An SSTab control is added to the Toolbox.)

3. Add an SSTab control to Form1.

4. Add a Frame control (Frame1) so that it is placed within Tab 0 of the SSTab
   control.

5. Add another Frame control (Frame2) so that it is contained in Frame1.

6. Add a Textbox control so that it is contained in Frame2.

7. With Textbox1 selected, minimize Visual Basic.

8. Restore the Visual Basic window. Note that Frame2 and TextBox1 are not
   visible but the controls can be selected. Frame2 and TextBox1 did not
   repaint.
