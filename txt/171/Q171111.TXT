SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a Gravis Ultrasound Classic, Max, or Ace sound card in Windows 95,
the following audio options are disabled:

 - The Volume Control option in the Volume Control tool.

 - The "Show volume control on the taskbar" check box in the Multimedia tool.

CAUSE
=====

The Gravis Ultrasound Classic, Max, and Ace sound cards do not support master
volume control.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Gravis Ultrasound Classic, Max, and Ace sound cards are based on the GF1
chip set. The Gravis drivers for the GF1 chip set automatically disable the
master volume control options in Windows 95 because these sound cards do not
support this feature.
