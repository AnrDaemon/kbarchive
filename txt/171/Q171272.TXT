TITLE   :FIX: SQL-SELECT into Array Causes Illegal Operation
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbvfp kbvfp500aFIX

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using a SQL-SELECT statement to populate an array from a FoxPro 2x table
containing deleted records with DELETED set on causes the operating system to
close Visual FoxPro 5.0.

When running under Windows 95, the following error appears:

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.

In Windows NT 4.0, the following error appears:

   An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
   generated.
   VFP.exe
   Exception: access violation <error number>, Address: <memory
   address>.

In both cases, the operating system then closes Visual FoxPro.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not issue a SET DELETED ON command and simply rewrite the SQL-SELECT
statement, as in the following example:

      SELECT * FROM ZTEST INTO ARRAY Zjunk WHERE DELETED()=.F.

-or-

      SELECT * FROM ZTEST INTO ARRAY Zjunk WHERE !DELETED()

Also, the results of the SQL-SELECT statement could be directed to a destination
other than to an array.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 5.0a and
does not occur in Visual FoxPro 3.x.

MORE INFORMATION
================

         USE HOME()+"Ztest.dbf"
         DELETE ALL FOR RECNO() < 10
         USE

         SELECT * FROM HOME()+"Ztest" INTO ARRAY Zjunk
         ? ALEN(zjunk)
