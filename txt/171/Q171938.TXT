The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for Macintosh 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Bookshelf 98 includes several 360-degree views in which you may pan
around to view a scene from a wide range of seamless views, much like your
turning around in a circle at a particular location. Not only can you look in
all directions, but you may also tilt the view up and down.

Unlike its Windows counterpart, the 360 degree views for the Macintosh version of
Bookshelf 98 do not have ambient music. In the Windows version, 360 degree views
with ambient music are indicated by a speaker symbol within the 360 degree view.
Regardless, the Windows and Macintosh products contain the same scenes for 360
degree views.
