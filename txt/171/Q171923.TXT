PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Service Pack 2 (SP2), all of the SP2 files that were installed
had only the Everyone (Full Control) ACL applied. Pre-SP2 files that had tighter
restrictions before SP2 no longer have any restrictions on them on NTFS
partitions.

CAUSE
=====

The Setup APIs that were being used by the Service Pack Update Routine did not
retain the attributes or security of the files.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been resolved in Service Pack 3 and later.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
