The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for Macintosh

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Bookshelf with your computer configured to utilize more
than one monitor, you may experience unexpected problems.

For example, if the Bookshelf program window is open on your secondary monitor,
other windows (such as Advanced Search or Bookshelf Daily) may open on the
primary monitor. The Books menu that allows you to select which books you are
searching in may also exhibit this behavior.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for
Macintosh. Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
