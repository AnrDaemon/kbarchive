======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With Visual Basic 5.0, prior to Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2, the Change
event of the DBCombo control did not fire when the user makes a selection from
the drop-down list. This behavior is different from previous versions of Visual
Basic.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service
Pack 2.

For more information on the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q170365 : INFO: Visual Studio 97 Service Packs - What, Where, and Why

For a list of the Visual Basic 5.0 bugs that were fixed in the Visual Studio 97
Service Pack 2, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

   Q171554 : INFO: Visual Basic 5.0 Fixes in Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2


MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: This change in behavior affects Visual Basic applications built with both
Visual Basic 4.0 (32-bit) and Visual Basic 5.0 because they both use the same
file, DBList32.ocx, for the DBCombo control. Once Visual Studio Service Pack 2
is installed, the problem no longer occurs.
