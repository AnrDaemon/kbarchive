Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project.

2. Add an instance of the mscomm32.ocx control to Form1.

3. Add the following code to Form1.

         Sub Form_Load()
           Show
           While True
              MSComm1.Settings = "9600, N, 8, 1"
              MSComm1.PortOpen = True
              x = Timer
              Do While x + 0.25 > Timer
                  DoEvents: DoEvents: DoEvents
              Loop
              MSComm1.PortOpen = False
              x = Timer
              Do While x + 0.25 > Timer
                  DoEvents: DoEvents: DoEvents
              Loop
           Wend
         End Sub
     

4. Run the application by pressing the F5 Key.

After about 100 iterations, memory will be reduced by about 4k.
