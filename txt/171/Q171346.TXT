SYMPTOMS
========

When you select Add Files on the toolbar or from the File menu, you might
receive the following message:

   Filter string exceeds the maximum length of 511

CAUSE
=====

The "filter string" corresponds to the values of the File_Types and the
Relevent_Masks initialization variables located in either or both the
SRCSAFE.INI and the users SS.INI. Together, these values exceed the maximum
length of 511 characters allowed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Reduce the number of unnecessary relevant masks or file groups that are
displayed in the "List files of type" list in the Add Files dialog box. To
accomplish this:

1. In Visual SourceSafe Explorer, go to the Tools menu, click Options, and click
   the "File Types" tab.

2. Delete or reduce the "File Groups" or the "File types included in file group"
   sections.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error message is documented in Help. You can find it by typing "filter" in
field 1 in the "Find" tab, and then selecting "filter" in field

1. The error message appears in field 3. Double-click it to display the topic.

For more detailed information about these INI variables, search the Online Help
Topics for "File_Types" (without the quotation marks). Also, from this topic,
click the "See Also" link, and then click the "File Types Options Tab" link.
