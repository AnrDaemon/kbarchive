-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After installing all the required components for Host Security Integration (HSI)
and configuring a new Host Security Domain for the first time, you may get the
following pop up error when opening Host Account Manager.

   Unable to locate Windows NT Password Synchronization Service in the target
   Windows NT domain. To browse other domains, use the "Select Domain" option of
   the "File" menu.

The Windows NT Event Viewer Application log will record the following two warning
messages:

   Event ID 22 - Host Process was unable to create connection handle to connect
   to PMP

   Event ID 1314 - Unable to locate a requested resource Supplied code 0

CAUSE
=====

During the installation of the Windows NT Password Synchronization Service
(SNAPMP), you are prompted to type in a list of Domain(s) which contain the Host
Account Cache (SNADATABASE). If something other than the Domain Name is
inadvertently entered in this field (such as the Server Name), SNAPMP will be
unable to register it's location with the Master DataBase where these accounts
reside.

If you trace on the SNA WinNT Account Synchronization (hsiint1.atf), when trying
to start the Host Account Manager, you will see where the RPC failure occurs.

   RegisterServer: SendRegisterMessage to returned error: STI - RPC Client
   object connect was called without specifying network address and no registry
   default was found. , trying again RegisterServer: Ssecond SendRegisterMessage
   to returned error: STI - RPC Client object connect was called without
   specifying network address and no registry default was found.
   RpcServerInitialize: StiSrvrRegister error for server PMP, STI - Unable to
   register server with MDB.

RESOLUTION
==========

In order to correct this problem, you must edit the registry and change the
MdbDomains key to reflect the correct Domain(s).


WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaPMP\Parameters

     MdbDomains: REG_MULTI_SZ: <Domain_Name(s)>

NOTE: Domain names must be entered on separate lines. An unlimited number of
additional Windows NT domain names can be added using this registry setting.
