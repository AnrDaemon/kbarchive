TITLE   :Creating Connection Gets Error Even If Link Service Selected
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a new connection, you may see the following message

   Must specify link service field

even though you have already selected a link service field.

CAUSE
=====

Before the connection record is added, its Adapter information is temporarily
nulled out and restored after a successful Add. If a value is left in a field on
the property page, the Validate fails, causing the Add to fail, an exception to
occur, and the Adapter is never restored.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
