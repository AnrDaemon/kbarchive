SYMPTOMS
========

After loading one project file (.VBP) and proceeding to load a second project
file, Visual Basic 5.0 reports that the second project is corrupted and cannot
be loaded. However, the second project opens fine if opened by itself and no
message about a corrupted project file appears.

this error.
