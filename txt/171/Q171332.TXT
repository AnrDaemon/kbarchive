TITLE   :Invalid LAA MAC Address Causes Network Driver Failure.
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If a user types invalid characters other than (0-9 A-F) or types more than 12
characters for the media access control address by not using hyphens between
bytes, Windows NT network driver interface specification (NDIS) cannot
initialize the card and will result in event message(s):

   Event ID: 7000
   Source: Service Control Manager
   Description: The IBM Token Ring Adapter (ISA/PCMCIA) driver service failed to
   start due to the following error:

   A Device attached to the system is not functioning.

And in some instances, depending on the invalid characters typed, the following
event log message may be displayed:

   Event ID: 6004
   Source: Eventlog
   Description: A driver packet received from the I/O subsystem was invalid. The
   data is the packet

   DATA: ........................ibmtok IBMTOK 17

CAUSE
=====

Some network adapter drivers allow an administrator to assign locally
administered addresses (LAA) or universally administered addresses (UAA) for the
installed adapter card. This allows administrators to manage media access
control addresses and use it for inventory control and troubleshooting purposes.
The media access control address consists of 6 bytes using HEX Numbers 0-9 and
A-F, so a typical media access control address would look like this:

   00-C0-4F-C9-F1-70

Most token ring adapter drivers present a dialog box during installation to allow
the user to type the LAA media access control address. The field presented to
the user allows for 17 characters and assumes the user is going to use hyphens
between bytes.

NOTE: Some OEM Ethernet drivers may also support this feature.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, clear the invalid entry by performing the following
steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
   double-click the Network icon.

2. Click the Adapters tab, select the installed adapter in question, and then
   click Properties. When the dialog box appears, verify that the media access
   control address displayed is valid or clear the entire entry and restart the
   computer.

The media access control address being used can be displayed from an MS-DOS
command prompt by typing:

   NET CONFIG WORKSTATION

Workstation active on:   NetBT_IBMTOK1 (00C04FC9F170) <--- media access
control address

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is up to the driver's installation .inf file to parse user input and
determine if the values entered are valid during network card installation. Some
OEM drivers will prevent invalid entries while other OEM drivers accept any user
input, that may cause problems during network card initialization.
