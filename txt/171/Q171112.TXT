   FPEXPLOR caused an invalid page fault in VT11UTL.DLL. FPEXPLOR caused an
   invalid page fault in VT11WEC.DLL.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if Win.com is located in the root directory (for example,
C:\).

RESOLUTION
==========

Move the Win.com file to your Windows directory. The default location for this
directory is C:\Windows.

NOTE: Windows will not start if Win.com is renamed or deleted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Win.com is required to start Windows 95. If Windows 95 does not find the file in
the Windows folder, it will look in the root directory of the drive on which
Windows is installed.
