TITLE   :Distributed Link Service Allows Link Type To Be Changed
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The configured Link Type for a Distributed Link Service can be changed after the
link service is installed, even though this should not be possible.

The Distributed Link Service configuration is not preventing the link type for a
distributed link service from being changed after it was installed. The link
type should not be configurable after the link service is installed, because the
connection properties are different for the various connection types. For
example, the connection parameters for an 802.2 DLC connection are different
than the parameters for a Leased Line SDLC connection.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,

spaces):

   S E R V P A C K


When the fix is applied, the Distributed Link Service configuration is updated to
prevent the link type from being changed after a Distributed Link Service is
installed with one exception. The exception is for Ethernet 802.2 and TokenRing
802.2 link types. Either one of these link types can be changed to the other,
because the 802.2 DLC connection parameters are the same for either Ethernet or
Token Ring connections.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you are using the Distributed Link Service (DLS) feature of SNA Server, the
Link Type parameter in the Distributed Link Service properties on a remote SNA
Server computer is used to specify the type of link being distributed by the
central SNA Server computer. For example, if the central SNA Server computer is
distributing an 802.2 DLC Link Service over an Ethernet adapter, the Link Type
on the Distributed Link Service would need to be Ethernet 802.2 on the remote
SNA Server computer.

NOTE: A Distributed Link Service will show up in SNA Server Manager as SnaRem1,
SnaRem2, and so on.

Under SNA Server 3.0 and 3.0 SP1, the Distributed Link Service Properties dialog
box lists the following Link Types:

   Channel Attach
   DFT
   Ethernet 802.2
   Leased SDLC
   Switched SDLC
   TokenRing 802.2
   Twinax
   X.25/QLLC.

All of these options remain available after the link service is installed.
