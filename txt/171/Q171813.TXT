SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to start Visual Basic may fail with the following error:

   VB5 caused an invalid page fault in module MSO97RT.DLL at 0137:306d820a

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by corrupt information in the Windows registry at the
following key:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Visual Basic\5.0\UI

This setting includes information regarding Visual Basic command bars (menus). If
this information is invalid, Visual Basic will crash at startup while attempting
to load command bar information.


RESOLUTION
==========

One solution is to reset (clear out) this setting using the Registry Editor
(regedit.exe). However, the recommended solution is to install the Visual Studio
97 Service Pack 2.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service
Pack 2.
