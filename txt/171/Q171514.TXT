SYMPTOMS
========

Closing a modal form in the Visual Basic 5.0 design environment may cause one of
the following errors:

   "Access Violation: Unhandled exception in VB5.EXE 0xC0000005: Access
   Violation" (Windows NT4)

   -or-

   "VB has caused an invalid page fault in module VB5.EXE at 0137:00419f1e"
   (Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Me)

CAUSE
=====

Visual Basic is trying to get the thread data from a control after it has been
unloaded. The error code that signaled that the control got unloaded is not
handled properly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service
Pack 2.

following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Threed32.ocx control shipped with Visual Basic 4.0 is required in order for
this behavior to occur.

A sample that reproduces this behavior is not available because this behavior
tends to occur sporadically, and usually only in large, complex projects.
