Steps to Reproduce
------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project.

2. Add a Microsoft Multimedia (MCI32.OCX) control to Form1.

3. Add the following code to Form1.

         Private Sub Form_Load()
             ' Set properties needed by MCI to open.
             MMControl1.Notify = False
             MMControl1.Wait = True
             MMControl1.Shareable = False
             MMControl1.DeviceType = "WaveAudio"
             MMControl1.filename = "C:\temp\test.wav"

             ' Open the MCI WaveAudio device.
             MMControl1.Command = "Open"
         End Sub

         Private Sub MMControl1_StopClick(Cancel As Integer)
             MMControl1.Command = "Save"
             MMControl1.Command = "Close"
         End Sub

4. Run the application (Press F5).

5. Click the Record button, then wait for a few seconds.

6. Click the Stop button. Notice that the folder "C:\TEMP" does not contain the
   file "test.wav" as expected.
