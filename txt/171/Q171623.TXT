TITLE   :Unable to Define a Low-Priority LUA LU in SNA Server Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you define an LUA LU in SNA Server Manager, there is no way to indicate
that the LUA LU is low priority. Instead, all LUA LUs created using SNA Server
Manager are defined as high priority, so that all traffic flowing over the LUA
LU is handled at the same priority as 3270 LUs.

You can set the priority in SNA Server version 2.x. The SNA Server 2.x
Administrator program supports configuration of the LUA LU priority through the
"High Priority LU" checkbox located in the LUA LU Properties dialog box.

CAUSE
=====


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Use the Snacfg.exe command line configuration program to add a low- priority
   LUA LU, using the following command:

   "SNACFG LUA <luaname> /ADD /CONNECTION:<name>
   /LUNUMBER:<value> /HIGHPRIORITY:No" (without the quotation marks)

   -OR-

 - To change an existing LUA LU to low priority, use this command:

   "SNACFG LUA <luaname> /HIGHPRIORITY:No" (without the quotation marks)

   -OR-

 - If the above command-line configuration method is not possible, see the fix
   to SNA Server Manager referenced below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
