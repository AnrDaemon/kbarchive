MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem occurs when the ListField and BoundColumn properties of the DBCombo
differ.

This bug may cause problems in Visual Basic 4.0 applications because the DBCombo
that ships with Visual Basic 5.0 has the same filename.

The problem does not occur when the DBCombo that ships with Visual Basic 5.0 is
used in conjunction with the RemoteData control that ships with Visual Basic 5.0
Enterprise Edition.
