PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:winword word97 kbmerge

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you save a mail merge main document, it will be saved in the foreground
even if the Allow Background Saves check box is selected.

When you close the mail merge main document, if you receive the following message
and if you click Yes to save, the data file is saved in the foreground:

   <Main document file name> is a mail merge main document that is
   attached to a data source <file name> that has not been saved. Do you
   want to save <data source file name>?

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The background save option is used to continue working in Microsoft Word while
you save a document. Keep in mind that background save uses additional system
memory. If you need to conserve system resources, you may want to turn off
background save. To disable the Background Save feature, do the following:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the Save tab.

2. Click to clear the Allow background saves check box.

NOTES:

 - When Microsoft Word saves a document in the background, a pulsing disk icon
   appears on the status bar.

 - If Microsoft Word cannot save a document in the background, for example, if
   you do not have enough hard disk space or if you are saving a document to a
   floppy disk, Word saves the document in the foreground instead.
