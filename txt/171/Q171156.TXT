KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Administrative Wizard under Windows NT Server 4.0, the Add User
Accounts option creates a User's Home Directory. The directory is created with
the Everyone group having Full Control rights. It should be created with only
the Owner having Full Control permissions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do either of the following:

 - Use User Manager for Domains to create the User's Home Directory; it will
   give the directory the correct permissions, and the user will have Full
   Control.

   -or-

 - After creating the directory with the Administrative Wizard, use Explorer to
   modify the permissions.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
