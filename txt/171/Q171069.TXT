TITLE   :SMS: Unable to Inventory Macintosh Files w/ Trademark Character
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbenv kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to inventory Macintosh software by file name, and the file name
contains the trademark or registered symbols, Systems Management Server
inventory will not inventory that file properly, and it will not show up in the
PC Properties for that system.

CAUSE
=====

There are two issues. The first is that INVMAC does not properly handle the OEM
to ANSI character translation. The second is that the Systems Management Server
site SQL Server also does OEM to ANSI translation. Due to these two issues,
software inventory fails to properly detect and report the extended characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft
Systems Management Server 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
