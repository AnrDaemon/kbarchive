TITLE   :Cluster Node May Fail to Join Cluster
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Cluster Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you evict a node from a cluster and then start the computer, the following
message may appear in the system event log:

   EVENT: 1009
   SOURCE: ClusSvc
   DESCRIPTION: Microsoft Cluster Server could not join an existing cluster and
   could not form a new cluster. Microsoft Cluster Server has terminated.

CAUSE
=====

The cluster service terminated because it could not join or form a cluster. The
failure may occur if you evict a node from a cluster and attempt to start it
without removing Microsoft Cluster Server.

The evict function should be used to completely remove a system from the cluster.
After using this feature, the system cannot rejoin the cluster without
reinstalling Microsoft Cluster Server.

This problem may also be caused by a corrupt configuration on the node that has
the error. In either case, it may be possible to resolve this situation if you
remove and reinstall Microsoft Cluster Server on that computer. If you do not
want it to be a member of the cluster, only remove Microsoft Cluster Server from
the affected system.

RESOLUTION
==========

To remove Microsoft Cluster Server from a computer, use the Add/Remove Programs
tool in the Control Panel.

To install Microsoft Cluster Server, use the Setup.exe program from the MSCS
folder on the Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition CD-ROM.

For more information about removal or installation of Microsoft Cluster Server,
please consult the product release notes or the Administrator's Guide for
Microsoft Cluster Server, or see the Support/Books folder on CD-ROM 1.
