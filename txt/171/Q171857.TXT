TITLE   :Long File Name Lost After Using Send To Command with WordPad
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95; WINDOWS NT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool osr2 win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you add WordPad to the Send To menu, and then use the WordPad command on the
Send To menu to activate a file with a long file name, the file's 8.3 alias is
displayed in the title bar of the WordPad window. If you then use WordPad to
save the file to a different location, the file's long file name is lost.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, save the file to the same location instead of
saving it to a different location. When you save the file to the same location,
the long file name is not lost. After you save the file, you can use My Computer
or Windows Explorer to copy or move the file to a different location.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the WordPad tool included with
the Windows versions listed above. We are researching this problem and will post
new information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
