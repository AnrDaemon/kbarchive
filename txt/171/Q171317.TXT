PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade from Windows NT version 3.51 to Windows NT version 4.0, the
system may stop responding on the subsequent restart while entering the
graphical user interface (GUI) portion of setup. When you use a Trident
TGUI94XXAGI video adapter and the Windows NT 3.51 driver from Trident, the
system may stop responding after carrying out the NTDETECT command while the
operating system loader displays the following message:

   Microsoft (r) Windows NT TM Version 4.0 (build 1381). 1 System Processor
   [32 MB Memory]

No error messages are displayed.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT 3.51 video driver supplied by Trident for the AGI series video
adapter, Agi.sys, is not compatible with Windows NT 4.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT Installed on FAT Drive
---------------------------------

If Windows NT is installed on a FAT drive, perform the following steps:

1. Start the computer with another operating system (such as MS-DOS, Microsoft
   Windows 95, or Microsoft Windows 3.x) and then rename Agi.sys in
   \Winnt35\System32\Drivers.

2. Copy Vga.sys to Agi.sys. Restart the computer and the upgrade will finish.

3. Contact Trident to obtain the updated Windows NT 4.0 video drivers. Then
   install them on your computer.

Windows NT Installed on NTFS Drive
----------------------------------

If Windows NT is installed on an NTFS partition, perform the following steps:

1. Install a parallel copy of Windows NT 4.0 into a different directory and then
   rename AGI.SYS in \Winnt35\system32\drivers.

2. Copy VGA.SYS to AGI.SYS.

3. Restart the computer and the upgrade will finish.

4. Contact Trident to obtain the updated Windows NT 4.0 video drivers. Then
   install them on your computer.

Continue to use the standard VGA driver.
