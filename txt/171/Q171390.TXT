TITLE   :Cluster Service May Not Start if DC Is Unavailable
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Cluster Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Microsoft Cluster Server on a non-domain controller, the cluster
service may not start and may yield the following events in the system event
log:

   EVENT: 7013
   SOURCE: Service Control Manager
   DESCRIPTION: Logon attempt with current password failed with the following
   error: There are currently no logon servers available to service the logon
   request.

   EVENT: 7000
   SOURCE: Service Control Manager
   DESCRIPTION: The Cluster Service failed to start due to the following error:
   The service did not start due to a logon failure.

CAUSE
=====

The cluster service could not start because the domain account that it uses
could not be validated. This situation may occur if domain controllers are
unavailable and the cluster nodes are only members of the domain, not domain
controllers. Clusters in a domain with only one domain controller have a much
higher potential for this type of failure.

RESOLUTION
==========

To reduce the potential for cluster startup failure, do one of the following:

 - Install Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition on each cluster node as a
   domain controller, before you install Microsoft Cluster Server.

the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   -or-

 - Install additional domain controllers within the domain and make sure they
   are available to the cluster at all times.

NOTE: This error can occur if the format of the account which the cluster starts
with (at Services\Cluster Service Properties\Log ON) is in the format
<clusteraccount>@<domain-name> e.g. clustersvc@microsoft.com. It
should be changed to DOMAIN\account, e.g. MICROSOFT\clustersvc. After this is
changed, the service should start automatically.
