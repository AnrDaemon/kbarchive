MORE INFORMATION
================

Below are two methods for reproducing the problem:

Method 1
--------

1. Start Visual Basic 5.0 and create a new Standard EXE project.

2. Add a new Module (Module1) to the project.

3. Paste the following code into the General Declarations area of Module1:

         Public Enum CrashMe
                Crash1 = Not (Crash0)
         End    Enum

4. Invoke the Object Browser by pressing the F2 key, or press the F5 key to run
   the application. Visual Basic will crash with an Application Error.

Method 2
--------

1. Repeat steps 1, 2, and 3 from Method 1.

2. Create a new subroutine named Test in the basic Module.

3. Type the following in the General Declarations section of Module1:

          Public Sub Test()
             Dim X As

4. Press the spacebar. Visual Basic will crash with an Application Error.

NOTE: The program will not crash if you define Crash0 in the declare of the Enum
type.
