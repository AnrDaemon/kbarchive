SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to include spaces in a hyperlink or Uniform Resource
Locator (URL) when composing a mail message in Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft
Outlook.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sometimes it may be necessary to point to a Web site, file name, or other
resource link (FTP, TELNET, NNTP, and so on) that contains spaces in the
reference. In these situations, you can enclose the hyperlink that references
these resources within the angle bracket characters (< and >). The
following examples illustrate the appropriate syntax to use:

      <http://www.company.com/Sales and Support>

      <file:\\myserver\myshare\Annual Report.txt>

      <\\Server\Share\Working Directory>
