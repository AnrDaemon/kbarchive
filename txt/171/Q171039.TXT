PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While in the midst of a file transfer session with a Windows 95 or 16-bit
Windows client, the Personal Computer Property Help Desk window freezes and none
of the Remote buttons work. Dragging the border or moving the window results in
window "footprinting," and the Local Files and Remote Files lists do not redraw
completely.

This problem may also occur when a file copy is not in progress.

CAUSE
=====

The File Transfer Slave window was closed on the client side.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, select another Properties item and then select the
Help Desk item again.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
