Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new ActiveX DLL project (Project1). Class1 is created by default.

2. Paste the following code in the General Declarations section of Class1:

         Public Function Test(a,b)
            Test = 3
         End Function

   NOTE: The exact function is not important. This error may also occur with
   Property Let and Property Get statements.

3. Change the Instancing property of Class1 to 6 - GlobalMultiUse.

4. Save Project1.

5. Go to File | Add Project to add a Standard EXE (Project2) to the project
   group.

6. From Project2, go to Project | References, to reference Project1 by clicking
   on its check box.

7. In the Form_Load event procedure of Form1, type "Project1.test" (without the
   quotation marks), and then hit the space key. An application error should
   occur.
