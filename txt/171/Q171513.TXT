3. Set the Backcolor property of the UserControl to &H000000FF& (red)
   and the Name property to "usrMovable."

4. Resize usrMovable so that it is fairly small.

5. Add the following code to the Click event of the UserControl:

         UserControl.Extender.DragMode = vbAutomatic

6. Add another UserControl to the project and set its Name property to
   "usrHolder."
