TITLE   :Eicon Drivers not Copied when Updating to SNA 3.0 SP1
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Eicon SDLC or X.25 link services will not start after upgrading an SNA
Server 3.0 configuration to SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 1. This problem will not
occur when running SETUP.EXE from SNA Server 3.0 Refresh CD that incorporates
Service Pack 1.

CAUSE
=====

This is due to a bad statement in the UPDATE.INI file from SNA Server 3.0
Service Pack 1. Running UPDATE.EXE resulted in the current
EC<SDLC/X25>.DLL being renamed to EC<SDLC/X25>.DL$, and the updated
EC<SDLC/X25>.DLL being copied only in
<SnaRoot>\system\hwsetup\ec<sdlc/x25> while it should also be copied
in the <SnaRoot>\system directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Once the upgrade process is complete, the user needs to manually copy the
EC<SDLC/X25>.DLL file from the
<SNA>\system\hwsetup\ec<sdlc/x25> directory to
<SnaRoot>\system.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0 Service
Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT 3.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
