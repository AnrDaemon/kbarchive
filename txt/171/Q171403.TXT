TITLE   :CardWizard May Cause Startup Hangs after Windows NT 4.0 SP
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:Windows4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2) or later on a system using
CardWizard for Windows NT version 2.0 or earlier, your system may stop
responding (hang) during restart.

CAUSE
=====

This problem exists because Windows NT Service Packs reinstall the Microsoft
native Pcmcia.sys driver over the custom Pcmcia.sys driver provided in The
CardWizard product.

The Windows NT Service Pack 3 Readme.txt file warns of this:

   If you are running SystemSoft's CardWizard for Windows NT (support for
   PCMCIA) or PowerProfiler for Windows NT (support for Advanced Power
   Management), you must complete critical pre-installation procedures prior to
   installing this Service Pack. Otherwise, your computer may no longer boot
   after installation of Service Pack 3. These procedures can be found in the
   product section at http://www.systemsoft.com.

WORKAROUND
==========

To get back into the system, rename the Pcmcia.sys file found in the
%SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers directory to something else.

For example: Pcmcia.old

On a FAT file system, start your computer from a MS-DOS disk and rename the
file.

On a NTFS file system, you will need to perform a parallel installation Of
Windows NT or follow the steps found in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
article:

   Q164471 Replacing System Files Using a Modified Emergency Repair Disk.

After you are back in Windows NT 4.0, uninstall CardWizard by running the Card
Wizard setup. Then reinstall CardWizard for Windows NT 4.0.

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3.
