TITLE   :CMINIT Returns Error 24 if Symbolic Name Not Space-Padded

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Calling CPIC Initialize_Conversation() (or CMINIT) may fail with error 24, or
CM_PROGRAM_PARAMETER_CHECK.

CAUSE
=====

The CPIC application must supply a sym_dest_name parameter to CMINIT. If the
sym_dest_name is less than eight characters long, the CPIC interface requires
the application to pad the name with spaces, or CPIC fails to match the name
against the CPIC symbolic names configured in the SNA Server configuration file,
causing CPIC to return CM_PROGRAM_PARAMETER_CHECK.

The CPIC Programmer's Guide does not document the requirement of providing a
space-padded sym_dest_name.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Space-pad the sym_dest_name passed to CMINIT, if the name is less than eight
   characters long.

An updated CPIC DLL is also available which automatically space-pads the name to
eight characters, if the application did not supply the sym_dest_name in this
format.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.0, 2.1,
2.11, 2.11 Service Pack 1 (SP1), 2.11 SP2, and 3.0 SP1.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
