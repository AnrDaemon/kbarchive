TITLE   :SNA Server Setup Does Not Support Long Paths and Filenames
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0 SP1; winnt:3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 SP1 
 - Microsoft SNA Workstation, version 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the installation path specified for SNA Server, SNA Workstation, SNA Server
Windows NT client, or SNA Server Windows 95 client contains more than 40
characters, or if the path contains spaces, the following error message is
displayed:

   Illegal Directory Specified

   Illegal directory name - Restart Setup and choose the target path for
   SNA Server to be max 40 characters, with no spaces.

CAUSE
=====

The Setup programs do not support paths that are greater than 40 characters in
length or contain spaces. These restrictions are necessary because some SNA
Server components do not function correctly if the installation path is greater
than 40 characters in length or if the path contains spaces.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0 Service
Pack 1 (SP1), SNA Workstation version 3.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1), SNA Server
Windows NT client version 3.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1), and SNA Server Windows 95
client version 3.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the
latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
this Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
(without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K


MORE INFORMATION
================


With the fix applied, the Setup programs for SNA Server 3.0 SP1, SNA Workstation
3.0 SP1, and SNA Server Windows NT client allow the installation path to be up
to 100 characters in length, including spaces. The setup program for the Windows
95 client sets the maximum path length to 100 characters, including spaces.


With the fix applied, other SNA Server components have been updated to support
the new longer installation paths allowed by the updated setup programs.


NOTE: These updates correct the restrictions described in the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q165460 SNA Server 3.0 Install Path Must Be Eight Characters or Less
