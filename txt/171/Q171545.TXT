   "Default" as the value of the optional parameter.

4. Create at least one property and attach it to the new interface.

5. Commit the transaction to save the new TIM.

6. Create an object instance based on the newly-defined class.

7. Try to access the property off the default interface using the following
   format: "Value = Object.Property."

   No error.

   RESULTS:

   Error number: 438
   Error description: Object doesn't support this property or method.
