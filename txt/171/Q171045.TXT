The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q194053.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a form field, the form field is repositioned on a new line
rather than remaining on the same line as preceding text.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because a form field must reside in a form. When you insert
a form field, FrontPage inserts a line break and creates the form area that
spans the entire width of the page. If you attempt to insert a form field after
having typed your text, the form is created below the line of text. This
behavior is by design.

RESOLUTION
==========

After you add the form field, place the text inside the form. To do this, follow
these steps:

1. Select the text you want to move into the form.

2. On the Edit menu, click Cut.

3. Place the insertion point to the left of the form field and then click Paste
   on the Edit menu.
