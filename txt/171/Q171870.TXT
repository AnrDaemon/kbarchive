TITLE   :FIX: SQL_CUR_USE_IF_NEEDED Does Not Work with 2.0 Drivers
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG #: 4538 (odbc30)

SYMPTOMS
========

If SQLSetConnectOption(SQL_ODBC_CURSORS, SQL_CUR_USE_IF_NEEDED) is set and you
are using an ODBC 3.0 Driver Manager with a 2.X driver, the ODBC Cursor Library
is not loaded. This causes applications that rely on the Cursor Library
implementation of ExtendedFetch to fail.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use SQLSetConnectOption(SQL_ODBC_CURSORS,
SQL_CUR_USE_ODBC) to load the ODBC Cursor Library.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Open Database
Connectivity version 3.0. This problem has been corrected in U.S. Service Pack 1
for Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 3.0. For more information,
contact your primary support provider.
