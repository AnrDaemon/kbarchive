TITLE   :FIX: Setup Quits When Microsoft ODBC Driver for Oracle Is Used
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER::1.0,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for Oracle (Build 2.06325), version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Commerce Server 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Commerce Server Setup uses the Microsoft ODBC driver for Oracle version
2.00.006325 to configure a new datasource, the Setup program quits without any
error messages.

CAUSE
=====

The Commerce Server Setup program uses invalid keywords for the Oracle driver in
the connection string. The driver does not permit any keywords that it does not
recognize, and closes the Setup program. This is a problem in the ODBC driver
that will be addressed in a future version.

WORKAROUND
==========

Configure a new system datasource using the ODBC Administrator in Control Panel
and then select this datasource during the Commerce Server Setup. Note that the
problem only occurs if you try to configure a new datasource from within the
Commerce Server Setup program.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of the article. This bug has been corrected in Microsoft's Oracle ODBC
driver, version 2.73.7269 and higher. You can obtain this driver or new drivers
in the Microsoft Data Access Components at the following Web address:
