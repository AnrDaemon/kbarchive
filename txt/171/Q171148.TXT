SUMMARY
=======

Detecting logon failures or account lockouts in a Windows NT domain with
multiple domain controllers and trusting domains may be difficult. To do this
manually would require the administrator to load the security event log of the
domain controllers, member servers, workstations, and set the filter to find the
logon failure events.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the Dumpel.exe utility from the Windows NT Resource Kit to enable the domain
administrator to automate this procedure.

By creating a simple batch file to query the security event log of all of your
Windows NT-based systems, you can quickly automate the process. The logon
failure events are only recorded in the log of the resource that denied access
to the user.

To automate this procedure, perform the following steps:

1. Install the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit.

2. For each domain, create a batch file that dumps the event logs of each domain
   member to a text file, filtering the log only on failure event IDs, as in the
   following example:

   @echo off
   Dumpel.exe -s pdcname -l security -m security -e 529 539 >
   %temp%\event539.txt
   Dumpel.exe -s bdc1name -l security -m security -e 529 539 >>
   %temp%\event539.txt
   Dumpel.exe -s bdc2name -l security -m security -e 529 539 >>
   %temp%\event539.txt
   Dumpel.exe -s bdc3name -l security -m security -e 529 539 >>
   %temp%\event539.txt
   Dumpel.exe -s memberserver1name -l security -m security -e 529 539 >>
   %temp%\event539.txt
   Dumpel.exe -s workstation1name -l security -m security -e 529 539 >>
   %temp%\event539.txt

3. This will append all Event 529s and Event 539s to the event539.txt file to be
   examined for log on problems.

   Event ID 529
   Logon Failure
   Reason: Unknown user name or bad password

   Event ID 539
   Logon Failure
   Reason: Account locked out

Common causes for invalid logon events:

 - Forgotten passwords, someone is entering the wrong password.
 - An unauthorized individual is trying to gain access to the network.
 - There is a persistent network connection with an invalid password.
 - There is a service using a user account with an invalid password.
 - Trust relationship has been broken.

On Service Pack 4 (SP4) and later domain controllers, event 644 can be configured
to mark an account lockout. For additional information, click the article number
