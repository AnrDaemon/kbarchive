TITLE   :WD97: Merged Table Cells and Rows Do Not Print Bottom Border
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you merge cells vertically, if the cells contain a left and right border in
the last row of a table, the bottom part of the left and right border will not
be printed, even though it shows up correctly in print preview.

NOTE: This behavior occurs only when the merged cells span more than one page.
Note also that a bottom horizontal border is not printed when merged cells span
a page break. This is a different issue from the one described in this article.

CAUSE
=====

When you vertically merge cells with a left and right border, the bottom part of
the left and right border is not "pushed down" so that the border applies to the
bottom of the new cells.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1 (SR-1).

NOTE: This will not correct the problem where the horizontal border of a merged
cell does not print if the merged cell spans a page break.

To work around this problem, after merging the cells, follow these steps to
remove and reapply the border settings:

1. Select the merged cells.

2. On the Format menu, click Borders And Shading.

3. Click the Borders tab.

4. Under Setting, click to select None.

5. Make sure the Apply To area is set to Cell.

6. Click OK.

7. Make sure that the cell is still selected.

8. On the Format menu, click Borders And Shading.

9. Click the Borders tab.

10. Under Setting, click the settings that you want to use for the border.

11. Click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
This problem was corrected in Microsoft Word 97 SR-1.

For additional information about SR-1, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION

This problem only occurs if the height of the cells is relatively small.
