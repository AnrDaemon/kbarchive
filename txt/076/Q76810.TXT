SUMMARY
=======

When using a Marstek mouse, you must use Marstek driver version 6.01 or later to
be compatible with Microsoft MS-DOS version 5.0 or later.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you load an old mouse driver in the CONFIG.SYS file, you may receive the
following message:

   Internal Configuration Registers Locked

To solve this problem, do one of the following:

 - Remove the following line from the CONFIG.SYS file:

      device=c:\mouse\mouse.sys

   and add the following line to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

      c:\mouse\mouse.com

   Where C:\MOUSE is the directory where the mouse file is located. Note: The
   mouse driver is shipped by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), who may
   have changed the driver name.
