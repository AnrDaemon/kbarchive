SUMMARY
=======

After installing Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade on a Zenith laptop with an internal
modem, the modem may cease to function. The modem must be turned on using the
original Zenith DOS MACHINE command as follows:

   machine modem on

MORE INFORMATION
================

To extend battery life, power is not supplied to the internal modem until it is
turned on with the MACHINE MODEM ON command. You may need to copy the
MACHINE.COM file from the OLD_DOS.1 directory or the original Zenith DOS disks
and use the SETVER command to report the original Zenith DOS version to
MACHINE.COM.

For more information on the SETVER command, see pages 561-564 of version 5.0
"Microsoft MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference."
