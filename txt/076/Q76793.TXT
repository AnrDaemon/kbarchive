======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You are attempting to install the MS-DOS 5 Upgrade, and the Setup instructions
on your screen are unreadable (garbled or truncated).

WORKAROUND
==========

If you are using an ATI WonderCard, or if you do not have a second computer that
correctly displays Setup instructions, call Microsoft Product Support Services
for help.

If you have a second computer that correctly displays Setup instructions, use it
to create a set of MS-DOS working disks. To do so, follow these steps:

1. On the second computer, insert MS-DOS version 5.0 Upgrade Disk 1 into drive
   A.

2. Type the following at the command prompt:

   " a: setup /f" (without the quotation marks)

   When Setup prompts you to confirm the hardware and software contents of your
   system, be sure to specify the display type of the computer that garbles
   Setup instructions. Setup creates a set of MS-DOS working disks. If you use
   3.5-inch disks, you will need four. If you use 5.25-inch disks, you will need
   six.

To set up MS-DOS 5.0 on the computer that garbles Setup instructions, follow this
procedure:

1. Insert the floppy Startup (or Startup/Support) disk into drive A of the
   computer that garbles Setup instructions.

2. Restart the computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

3. Check to make sure you can access all drives. If you can't access all drives,
   call Microsoft Product Support Services for help.

4. Type the following at the command prompt:

   " sys c:" (without the quotation marks)

   Setup copies the system files to drive C.

5. Type the following to make drive C the active drive:

   " c:" (without the quotation marks)

6. Type the following to change to the root directory of drive C:

   " cd\ " (without the quotation marks)

7. Type the following to create a directory named OLDDOS:

   " md olddos" (without the quotation marks)

8. Change to your DOS directory. For example, if your DOS directory is named
   DOS, type the following:

   " cd DOS" (without the quotation marks)

9. Copy all MS-DOS files to the OLDDOS directory by typing the following:

   " copy *.* c:\olddos" (without the quotation marks)

10. Copy MS-DOS version 5.0 files from each of your floppy disks to the DOS
   directory on drive C. For example, to copy all the files from the disk
   inserted in drive A to the DOS directory on drive C, type the following:

   " copy *.* c:\dos" (without the quotation marks)

11. If you are using Microsoft Windows version 3.0, copy the WINA20.386 file
   from your DOS directory to your root directory on drive C by typing the
   following command:

   " copy wina20.386 c:\ " (without the quotation marks)

   This file is necessary to run Windows version 3.0 in 386 enhanced mode.

12. Use the new AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files in your DOS directory to
   update the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files in the root directory of drive
   C. The new files contain several commands that you should include in the
   files located in the root directory.
