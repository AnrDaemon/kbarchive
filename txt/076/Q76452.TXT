TITLE   :PRB: Global TSR Pop-ups Incompatible with Windows
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a TSR (terminate-and-stay-resident) program loaded before Windows (a global
TSR) is used to create a pop-up window over the Windows display, the display
will be disrupted.

CAUSE
=====

When a global TSR pop-up window attempts to overlay the Windows display, the
pop-up places the system virtual machine into text mode, which disrupts the
Windows Virtual Display Device (VDD). When the pop-up is complete, the display
is not restored properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Global TSR pop-ups are incompatible with Windows. The same functionality should
be written into a Windows-based application.

Additional query words: 3.00 no32bit 3.10
