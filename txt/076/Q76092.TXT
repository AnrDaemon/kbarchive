TITLE   :CONN: MAPPINGS.TXT File Lists Incorrect Conversion File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For Appletalk Networks
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Connection Gateway, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Lotus files transferred through the Microsoft Mail Connection Gateway do not
transfer correctly with the default MAPPINGS.TXT file installed in the STORE
directory. The files may open as blank files, or they may even stop (crash)
Excel for the Macintosh. These files are corrupted beyond repair and cannot be
opened from within Lotus when they are transferred back to the Mail for PC
Networks platform.

CAUSE
=====

The MAPPINGS.TXT file incorrectly lists the following lines:

   .WKS=Lotus 1-2-3 1.x -> Microsoft Excel:TEXT:XCEL:Text
   .WK1=Lotus 1-2-3 2.x -> Microsoft Excel:TEXT:XCEL:Text
   .WK3=Lotus 1-2-3 3.x -> Microsoft Excel:TEXT:XCEL:Text

RESOLUTION
==========

These listings for Lotus 1-2-3 files should end with the word Binary instead of
Text. Open file in any text editor that supports saving in a text format and
change the lines to the following:

   .WKS=Lotus 1-2-3 1.x -> Microsoft Excel:TEXT:XCEL:Binary
   .WK1=Lotus 1-2-3 2.x -> Microsoft Excel:TEXT:XCEL:Binary
   .WK3=Lotus 1-2-3 3.x -> Microsoft Excel:TEXT:XCEL:Binary

NOTE: The MAPPINGS.TXT file must be located in the MSGATE directory in the
Connection store.
