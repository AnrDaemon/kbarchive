HookAll.exe is a sample program in the Microsoft Download Center that
demonstrates the use of WH_GETMESSAGE and WH_CALLWNDPROC hooks. The sample
contains the code for a dynamic-link library (DLL) with functions to set and
remove the hooks, as well as the hook filter functions. The filter functions use
OutputDebugString to display a message when they receive a WM_LBUTTONDOWN
message. The sample also contains code for an application that tests the DLL.
