SUMMARY
=======

After installing Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade on a Zenith MinisPort HD computer,
the computer will not boot properly unless the external floppy disk drive is
connected.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the Zenith MinisPort external drive is not connected, the computer will
display the following message:

   Non-System disk or disk error
   Replace and press any key to continue.

MS-DOS 5.0 is compatible with this machine; however, to remedy the above problem,
you must connect the external floppy disk drive to boot with DOS 5.0, or it must
boot from internal ROM DOS.

To enable the machine to boot from ROM DOS, press CTRL+ALT+INSERT to access CMOS
setup, and type "setup" (without the quotation marks) at the command prompt.
CMOS setup will allow you to change the boot options to ROM DOS.
