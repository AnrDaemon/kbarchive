======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 2.0e, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You cannot run a workstation installation of PowerPoint from the floppy disks.
In PowerPoint for Windows, versions 2.0e and 3.0, the /N parameter is for
running PowerPoint Setup from a shared network installation of PowerPoint. In
PowerPoint 4.0, and 7.0, the /N parameter for Setup has an entirely different
meaning; however, you still cannot run a workstation installation from the
floppy disks.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Program Manager, if you choose Run from the File menu and enter "a:setup /n"
(without the quotation marks) while attempting to run a workstation installation
of PowerPoint from the floppy disks, you receive the following error message in
PowerPoint 2.0e:

   The "/N" option is not available for this version of PowerPoint Setup. To run
   "Setup /N", make sure that your network administrator has installed
   PowerPoint onto the network using the "Setup /Expand" option.

You receive the following error message in PowerPoint 3.0:

   This shared installation of PowerPoint has not been properly installed.
   Please contact your System Administrator

You receive the following error message in PowerPoint 4.0, and 7.0:

   The command line user name option (/N) must provide a double quoted string of
   no more than 52 characters.

To correctly run a workstation installation of PowerPoint versions 2.0 and 3.0,
run Setup from the shared network administrative installation of PowerPoint
(using the /N parameter).

Note that for PowerPoint 4.0, and 7.0, the /N option does not specify an
installation of a shared version of a product to be run from a network location.
To install a shared version of this product, run Setup from the shared network
administrative installation of PowerPoint 4.0, or 7.0 and select Workstation
from the four installation options in the Setup dialog box.
