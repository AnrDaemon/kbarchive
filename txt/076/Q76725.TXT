TITLE   :FIX: INVOKE May Cause Incorrect Line Information
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.0 may generate line information
that does not match the assembled code. When the parameters on an INVOKE
statement are listed on more that one source line, line number information after
the INVOKE might not match the assembled code. Incorrect line information will
cause the assembler to show errors on the wrong lines. It also causes the
CodeView debugger to appear to execute blank lines, comments, or wrong lines. In
addition, it can cause problems setting breakpoints in CodeView.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, put all of the parameters of an INVOKE call on the same
line in the source code.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 6.0. This problem
was corrected in MASM version 6.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the following sample code is run using CodeView, the debugger will appear
to execute the wrong lines.

Sample Code
-----------
