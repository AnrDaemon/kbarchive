SUMMARY
=======

In Windows version 3.1, a Windows-based application can obtain the amount of
free system resources in two ways:

1. By calling the GetFreeSystemResources() function, which is exported by
   USER.EXE

2. By calling the SystemHeapInfo() function, which is exported by the
   TOOLHELP.DLL dynamic-link library

Under Windows 3.0, the GetFreeSystemResources() function is not available. If
TOOLHELP.DLL is present, a Windows 3.0 application can use SystemHeapInfo(). If
TOOLHELP.DLL is not present, there is no supported method for a Windows 3.0
application to obtain the amount of free system resources.
