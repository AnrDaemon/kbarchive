SUMMARY
=======

Colorado Tape Backup Systems FC10 (8-bit) and TC15 (16-bit) internal tape cards
may conflict with EMM386.EXE. Symptoms include intermittent memory conflicts,
system hangs when EMM386.EXE attempts to install, and the inability to access
upper memory blocks (UMBs).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The FC10 and TC15 tape backup cards come with an installation program that
automatically assigns an open hardware interrupt (IRQ) and memory address. The
selected memory address may conflict with EMM386.EXE.

To work around this possible conflict, try one of the following:

 - Manually change the address through the tape backup card installation
   software.

-or-

 - Exclude the appropriate memory address on the EMM386.EXE line. For example:

   device=c:\dos\emm386.exe x=d000-dfff
