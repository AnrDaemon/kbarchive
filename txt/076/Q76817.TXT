======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Fountain 286 8/12 MHz computer will perform at 8 MHz after the installation
of MS-DOS 5 Upgrade. HIMEM.SYS, which is added to the CONFIG.SYS file during
MS-DOS 5.0 setup, may be causing the reduced speed.

To correct this problem, use the MACHINE:12 switch and set the CPUCLOCK switch to
On with the HIMEM.SYS driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following syntax should be used for the device driver HIMEM.SYS in the
CONFIG.SYS file:

   device=[drive:][path]himem.sys /machine:12 /cpuclock:on

This will enable A20 handler number 12, instead of the default number 1, and
allow the CPU clock to affect the processing speed of HIMEM.SYS. Note: Though
the computer's processing speed may increase, XMS access speed may decrease.

The product included here is manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
