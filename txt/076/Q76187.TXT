The installation of Norton Utilities 6.0 will display the following window at 98

   ****************** Install ***********************
   * Would you like to add help for the Norton      *
   * Utilities programs to your DOS 5 help file?    *
   *                                                *
   * DOS 5 provides the capability to get help on   *
   * its various commands through the HELP program. *
   * By typing HELP followed by the name of         *
   * a command or program, you can get quick help   *
   * on the use of the command or program.          *
