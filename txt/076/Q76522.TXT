SUMMARY
=======

You can use the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE)
to determine who owns a shared folder or a group folder.

To generate a report file, use the Local-Admin, Folders, Print, File command and
enter a text filename. The resulting text file is a log of mail system public
folders showing the folder name, folder type (shared or group), the privileges,
and the owner name.

The following is a sample report created from the Administrator program:
