The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Setup program for Windows with Multimedia Extensions detects a installed
version of Windows on your hard drive if one exists. You then have the option of
updating that version of Windows to include the Windows with Multimedia
Extensions or create a new directory to install both Windows version 3.0 and the
Multimedia Extensions.

This information does not apply to later versions of Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Setup detects a current Windows directory, it will display the directory
name. If you want to update that version of Windows to include the Multimedia
Extensions, then continue with the Setup routine.

If you want to install a separate copy of Windows with the Multimedia Extensions,
then use the BACKSPACE key to delete the current path and type a new directory
for Windows with Multimedia Extensions.

Additional query words: MMWIN 3.00 WIN30
