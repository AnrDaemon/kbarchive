TITLE   :BUG: PWB May Hang If <ASSIGN> Pseudofile Not Closed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If changes are made to the <ASSIGN> pseudofile and the file is not closed,
and an operation is performed that requires access to the TOOLS.INI file,
Microsoft Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) version 1.1 may hang while trying to
update TOOLS.INI.

CAUSE
=====

The <ASSIGN> pseudofile is directly linked to the TOOLS.INI file, which is
located in the directory pointed to by the INIT environment variable. Nondefault
editor settings are read from the TOOLS.INI file and are written to the
TOOLS.INI file when changes are made and then the <ASSIGN> file is saved.
If the <ASSIGN> pseudofile is open, and PWB needs to read information from
the TOOLS.INI file, PWB may hang.

RESOLUTION
==========

If changes are made to the <ASSIGN> pseudofile, close the file by choosing
the Close command from the File menu before accessing any other files or menu
items.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in PWB version 1.1.

This is not a problem with PWB version 2.0, since pseudo files are no longer
used.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To reproduce this problem, follow the instructions below:

1. Start PWB and edit a .C source file.

2. Save the current build options using a name of your choice, by choosing the
   Save Current Build Options command from the Build Options dialog box under
   the Options menu.

3. Open the <Assign> pseudofile by choosing the Editor Settings option
   from the Options menu.

4. Change some value (for example, change Wordwrap from no to yes) and move the
   cursor off the line, causing the change to become active.

5. Save the editor settings using the Save command from the File menu, but do
   not close the file.

6. Set the current build options to the ones that you just saved by choose Set
   Initial Build Options from the Build Options dialog box.
