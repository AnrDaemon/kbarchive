SUMMARY
=======

Tips Plus version 1.5 may have trouble installing after Microsoft MS-DOS version
5.0 has been installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Tips Plus, manufactured by True Vision, is a graphics paint product that is used
with a True Vision Targa Board. After MS-DOS 5.0 is installed, the Tips Plus
program may have difficulty installing. If the message "Packed file corrupt"
appears, you should use the MS-DOS LOADFIX command as follows:

   loadfix [drive:][path]INSTALL.EXE

The program should now install correctly. However, if Tips Plus gets partially
through its installation and displays the error message "program failed to
load," you must use the following workarounds:

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Load DOS low. This is done in the CONFIG.SYS file as follows:

      device=[drive:][path]himem.sys
      dos=low

2. According to True Vision technical support, when installing Tips Plus under
   MS-DOS 5.0, INSTALL.EXE should be added to the MS-DOS version table as
   follows;

      setver [drive:path] install.exe x.xx

   where x.xx is the MS-DOS version number, which should be set to 4.01. The
   version number can also be set to 3.x; however, this does not ensure
   successful Tips Plus 1.5 installation.

3. 
   a. Boot from a previous DOS system disk (DOS 3.x has not been reliable for
      successful Tips Plus installation according to True Vision; DOS 4.x is
      suggested)

   b. Install Tips Plus 1.5.

   c. Reboot from the hard drive under MS-DOS 5.
