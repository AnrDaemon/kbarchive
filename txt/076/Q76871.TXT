The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft does not provide an application programming interface (API)
to access digital signal processing (DSP) hardware in Windows with
Multimedia Extensions version 1.0. An API of this type should provide
device independence, which is very difficult, given the diversity of
DSP hardware configurations on the market today.

However, it is possible to access DSP functions through a higher-level
API provided by Windows with Multimedia Extensions. To provide this
functionality through an audio driver customized to the particular DSP
board, the Multimedia Device Development Kit is required. The audio
driver API is written to provide device independence.
