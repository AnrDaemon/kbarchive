TITLE   :PRB: Help File Missing Green Text Using WACOM Tablet
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Windows Help application is run on a system with a WACOM tablet
installed, context jumps and glossary entries do not appear on the screen.

CAUSE
=====

The default color for Windows Help hypertext keywords is light green. The
recommended settings for using Windows with the WACOM tablet disable the green
video signal.

RESOLUTION
==========

Two settings in the WIN.INI file allow the user to specify a different color for
the hypertext keywords. Use a text editor to modify the WIN.INI file. Find the
[Windows Help] section. Add two lines that resemble the following:

   " JUMPCOLOR=(255,0,0)
   POPUPCOLOR=(255,0,0) " (without the quotation marks)

This process will change the hypertext keywords to red. The value to the right of
the equal sign represents a red, green, blue (RGB) color-value triple. While any
color can be specified, because the green signal is disabled, changing the green
parameter will make no difference in the color selected.
