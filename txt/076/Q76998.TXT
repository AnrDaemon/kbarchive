The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Lansmart has confirmed that there are two requirements for compatibility between
Lansmart and MS-DOS 5.0:

 - Lansmart version 3.0

 - SHARE.EXE copied from the DOS subdirectory to the Lansmart subdirectory

When installing MS-DOS 5 Upgrade after installing Lansmart, the following error
message may be displayed:

   Incorrect DOS Version

If you do get this error message, it can be resolved by copying the file
SHARE.EXE from the MS-DOS 5.0 directory to the Lansmart subdirectory.

Lansmart is a peer-to-peer network made by D-Link Datex Systems Inc.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Lansmart is upgraded after the MS-DOS 5 Upgrade installation, the SHARE.EXE
file will be copied to the Lansmart subdirectory as part of the upgrade
procedure. The SHARE.EXE file in the Lansmart directory is from the DOS version
before the the MS-DOS Upgrade was installed.

SHARE.EXE is needed for file sharing in a network environment.

There are two releases of Lansmart 3.0. The first release, with file dates of
7-12-91 or earlier, is not compatible with MS-DOS 5.0. Lansmart made a silent
release to resolve the compatibility problem.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
or reliability.
