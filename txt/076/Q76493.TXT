SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.1 of the Windows Help engine supports the ability to author topics to
contain a nonscrolling region of text immediately below the button bar. Text and
graphics remain in this fixed location even as the user scrolls other text in
the topic. This nonscrolling region appears the same as other text, except a
thin black line divides the nonscrolling region from the rest of the text in the
topic. This region can contain any of the formats applicable to a help file (hot
spots, bitmaps, and so forth).

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create a nonscrolling region, you must create the \pard\keepn rich-text
format (RTF) token. To accomplish this using Microsoft Word for Windows version
2.0, perform the following four steps:

1. Select the text to place in the nonscrolling region.

2. From the Format menu, choose Paragraph.

3. In the Paragraph dialog box, select the Keep With Next check box under
   Pagination.

4. Choose the OK button or press the ENTER key.

The background color attribute of the nonscrollable region can be changed in the
[WINDOWS] section of the help project (.HPJ) file. The characteristics of any
window in the help file may be specified in the [WINDOWS] section. Use the
following syntax to perform this step:

   type-name="caption", (horizontal_position, vertical_position, width,
        height), sizing, (client-RGB), (nonscrolling-RGB)

To change the color of the nonscrolling region, modify the final RGB triple. For
example, the following specification will change the background color of the
nonscrolling region to red:

   main="",,0,,(255,0,0)
