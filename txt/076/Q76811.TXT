SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the Built-In Game I/O Port feature of the Sound Blaster
card hardware and how it works with Windows with Multimedia Extensions version
1.0 and Windows version 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Built-In Game Port is a standard 15-pin D-Sub PC analog joystick adapter
port. The Sound Blaster allows two joysticks to be connected through this port
with the aid of a Y-cable (sold separately). Windows with Multimedia Extensions
can be configured to use this as two normal two-dimensional joysticks or one
three-dimensional joystick.

The only confusing part is Creative Lab's use of "I/O" for this joystick port.
Joysticks are INPUT devices only. The only OUTPUT that this port provides is for
musical instrument digital interface (MIDI).

Sound Blaster is manufactured by Creative Labs, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
