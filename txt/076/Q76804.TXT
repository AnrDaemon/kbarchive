OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run Windows with Multimedia Extensions in 386 enhanced mode and you start
an MS-DOS application that uses audio, the following error message is
displayed:

   This application will not be able to use audio.

CAUSE
=====

When Windows with Multimedia Extensions is run in 386 enhanced mode, Windows
takes control of the audio hardware and does not relinquish control to an MS-DOS
application.

WORKAROUND
==========

As an alternative, Windows with Multimedia Extensions can be run in standard
mode by typing

   win /s

at the MS-DOS command prompt. This allows the MS-DOS application to run from
Windows with audio intact.
