The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Connection Gateway, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you start MSGATE.EXE, Mail Connection, by default, always looks for the
file M:MSGATE\INI\MSGATE.INI. You can use the -N or /N command-line parameter to
specify a different, eight-character .INI filename (this example assumes that
the current directory of drive M is the root of the Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks postoffice):

1. Change to the MSGATE\INI directory on the gateway postoffice.

2. Copy the MSGATE.INI file to a new file called TEMP.INI.

3. Start the MSGATE.EXE program with the following command line:

   msgate -ntemp'

   When the gateway starts, the following extra line appears:

   Instance: TEMP

Additional query words: 1.00
