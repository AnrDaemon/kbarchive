Some of the CD-ROM drives provided with IBM PS/2s are supplied with
the IBMCDROM.SYS driver dated 2-7-90. This driver does not work
correctly with Windows with Multimedia Extensions and the MSCDEX.EXE
file provided with Windows with Multimedia Extensions. An updated
IBMCDROM.SYS dated 6-1-90 corrects these problems. This driver can be
obtained from your IBM dealer or field representative.

Please note that MSCDEX.EXE version 2.2 or later provided with Windows
with Multimedia Extensions must be used to run Windows with Multimedia
Extensions.

The IBM products included here are manufactured by a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
