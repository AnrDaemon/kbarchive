-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The MS-DOS 5.0 or later FORMAT utility prompts for a volume label after you
format a floppy disk. This label prompt can be disabled.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To eliminate the volume label message (and the necessity to press the ENTER
key), add the following switch to the FORMAT command line:

   format [drive]: /v:<ALT+Keypad 255>

Note: Entering a space instead of <ALT+Keypad 255> will not work.

Adding the above switch will disable the volume label prompt and allow the disk
to be formatted. It will create a disk with a volume label of a non-printing
ASCII blank character. Including this statement in a batch file or creating a
Doskey macro will help automate disk formatting.

Additional query words: 6.22 5.00 5.00a 6.00 6.20
