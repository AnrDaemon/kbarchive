TITLE   :PRB: Pen Cursor Does Not Appear When Tablet Used
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After installing Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing, no mouse cursor appears on
the screen.

CAUSE
=====

The tablet drivers supplied with Windows for Pen Computing are not mouse
drivers. The mouse cursor is displayed only if a mouse driver detects the
presence of mouse hardware on the system.

RESOLUTION
==========

To ensure that the mouse cursor is shown, you must either load a mouse driver or
load the YESMOUSE.DRV file in place of a mouse driver. Mouse hardware is
required to use a mouse driver; mouse hardware is not required to use the
YESMOUSE driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the Pen Windows system queries the hardware to determine whether a mouse is
installed, the YESMOUSE driver acts as the mouse hardware. Therefore, Pen
Windows acts as if a mouse is installed.

To install the YESMOUSE driver, modify the "mouse.drv" line in the [boot] section
of the SYSTEM.INI file as follows:

      [boot]
      mouse.drv=yesmouse.drv

If the YESMOUSE.DRV file is not in the Windows system directory, in the
SYSTEM.INI file, specify the complete path to the YESMOUSE.DRV file.
