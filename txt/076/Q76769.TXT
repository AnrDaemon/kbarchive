with Multimedia Extensions directory.

This information does not apply to later versions of Windows.

WHAT IF YOU RUN OUT OF MEMORY?
==============================

As you're running applications in Windows or are trying to start an
application, you might receive messages about being out of memory. You
can find out how much memory is available and of what type by choosing
the About command from the Help menu in either Program Manager or File
Manager. A dialog box containing memory information appears.

The following list describes each memory category and suggests how to
increase available memory:

Amount of memory free   This number is the amount of conventional
                        memory currently available for
                        applications.

                        When you run Windows in standard mode,
                        this number includes extended memory.

                        When you run Windows in 386 enhanced
                        mode, this number includes virtual
                        memory and could be much larger than the
                        physical amount of memory in your
                        computer.

                        If you need more memory or if the amount
                        of free memory is less than 30K, close
                        some applications.

Amount of EMS free      When you run Windows in real mode with
                        an expanded memory driver installed,
                        this number shows the amount of expanded
                        memory currently available. It is
                        possible to have plenty of expanded
                        memory available, but be out of
                        conventional memory.

                        You can close some applications to free
                        up conventional memory.

                        You will be unable to use the Multimedia
                        extensions when running Windows in real
                        mode.

SMARTDrive Amount       This number is the amount of expanded
                        memory claimed by SMARTDrive. Windows
                        3.0 can allocate memory from SMARTDrive
                        as needed.

                        For more information on how to use
                        SMARTDrive, see Chapter 4, "Optimizing
                        Your System," in Introducing Windows with
                        Multimedia.

System Resources        This number is the percentage of system
                        resources available. This number never
                        reaches 100% because the system itself
                        takes up some system resources.

                        If this number is too low (about 15%),
                        you cannot run more applications
                        regardless of how much free memory you
                        have. Close some applications to free
                        system resources.
