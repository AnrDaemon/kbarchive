Temporarily Removing the Norton Desktop as the Windows Shell
------------------------------------------------------------

To correctly install the Productivity Pack on a machine with Norton Desktop you
will need to remove Norton Desktop as the Windows shell and replace it with the
Program Manager. Use the following steps to make this change.

1. Run the Windows 3.0 Notepad program.

2. Open the file SYSTEM.INI located in the Windows directory.

3. Edit the "SHELL=" line to read

         SHELL=PROGMAN.EXE

   instead of SHELL=NDW.EXE.

4. Save the modified file and exit Windows.

5. Run the Productivity Pack Setup program as you normally would.

6. You can then change the "SHELL=" line back once the Setup program has
   completed.
