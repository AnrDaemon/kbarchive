SUMMARY
=======

PC Tools PC Shell version 6.0 from Central Point Software may hang if MS-DOS is
loaded into the high memory area (HMA). The conflict occurs when PC Shell
verifies that all of DOS is loaded into conventional memory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The LOADFIX.COM file will resolve this conflict and should be used to launch PC
Shell when DOS is loaded into the HMA. To execute PC Shell with LOADFIX, execute
the following command from a DOS prompt:

   " loadfix pcshell " (without the quotation marks)

LOADFIX.COM is located in the DOS directory. It can also be found on the
Supplemental working disk, which is created with a setup to floppies (SETUP
/F).
