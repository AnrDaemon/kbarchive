TITLE   :FORMAT Parameters Versus DRIVPARM/DRIVER.SYS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you use the DRIVPARM command or DRIVER.SYS device driver in the CONFIG.SYS
file, it will override any parameters specified by the FORMAT command. For all
intents and purposes, the drive will become the type of drive specified by the
DRIVPARM and DRIVER.SYS commands; therefore, any attempt to format a disk using
the drive's true parameters will fail.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DRIVPARM command in the CONFIG.SYS file allows you to modify the parameters
of an existing physical disk drive. The settings specified in the DRIVPARM
command override any previous driver definitions, even those specified when
using the FORMAT command.

Example
-------

If you use the DRIVPARM command to redefine a high density (1.44 MB, 3.5-inch)
disk drive as a low density (720K, 3.5-inch) disk drive, the FORMAT command will
be unable to format a disk as high density when using the redefined drive. If
you try to do so, the following error message will be displayed:

   Parameters Not Compatible. Format Terminated.

For more information on the DRIVPARM command, see page 455 of the version 5.0
"Microsoft MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference."

The DRIVER.SYS device line in the CONFIG.SYS file allows you to create a logical
drive that can be used to refer to a physical floppy disk drive and/or to modify
the parameters of an existing physical disk drive. The settings specified in the
DRIVER.SYS device line override any previous driver definitions, even those
specified when using the FORMAT command.

EXAMPLE
-------

If you use the DRIVER.SYS device line to redefine a high density (1.44 MB,
3.5-inch) disk drive as a low density (720K, 3.5-inch) disk drive, the FORMAT
command will be unable to format a disk as high density when using the redefined
drive. If you try to do so, the following error message will be displayed:

   Parameters Not Compatible.
   Format Terminated.

For more information on the DRIVPARM command, see page 602 in the version 5.0
"Microsoft MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference."
