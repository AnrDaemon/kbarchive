 - Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows with Multimedia Extensions uses installable device drivers for
hardware-specific support. In addition to the standard device entries in the
SYSTEM.INI file, Windows with Multimedia Extensions introduces another
convention: the use of "driver specific" parameters on the driver entry.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, an entry in the SYSTEM.INI file might look like the following:

      [mci]
      cdaudio=mcicda.drv
      waveaudio=mciwave.drv 4

The "waveaudio=" entry has both the driver name, MCIWAVE.DRV, and an extra
parameter that is specific to the MCIWAVE.DRV driver (4). In this example, "4"
is the number of seconds of wave data the MCIWAVE.DRV should buffer.

Because this parameter can be stored here, MCIWAVE.DRV is not required to add
another section to the SYSTEM.INI file to store the number of seconds to
buffer.

This parameter can be changed through the Drivers application in the Control
Panel by choosing Setup for the MCIWAVE.DRV driver (in the Control Panel window,
select the Drivers icon, select the MCIWAVE.DRV driver, then choose the Setup
button).
