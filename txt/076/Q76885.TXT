The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows versions 1991 edition, 1992 edition, 1993 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows, graphic images that have hotspots cannot be
copied to the Windows Clipboard.

Graphics with hotspots are not device independent bitmaps. Because they are not
in a format that Windows Clipboard can understand they cannot be copied to the
Windows Clipboard.

Workaround
----------

Use the Windows ALT+PRINT SCREEN function.

For more information on using the Windows ALT+PRINT SCREEN function, refer to the
"Microsoft Windows User's Guide."
