SUMMARY
=======

When using Pyro!, a screen saver from Fifth Generation Systems, the Microsoft
MS-DOS version 5.0 Shell screen will blink after Pyro! has been activated.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the Pyro! screen saver is invoked, Shell will blink after the screen saver
has been used. This occurs when you press any key to return to normal operations
after the screen saver has been activated.

Task switching to another application and then going back to Shell will stop the
screen from blinking. Re-expanding the DOSSHELL.VID file has no effect on this
reaction.

The product included here is manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
