SUMMARY
=======

Once the Search Results window has the focus in any book of Bookshelf for
Windows, there are no keyboard interface to switch the focus back to the parent
book window. This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion
in a future release.


Alternate techniques for switching the focus, which overcome this limitation, are
as follows:

1. Press ALT+SPACEBAR to access the system menu of the search window and close
   it.

   -or-

2. Press ALT+SPACEBAR to access the system menu of the search window and
   minimize it. This is not recommended, however, because once the search window
   has been minimized, it relinquishes the focus to the parent book window, but
   there is no way for the search window to regain the focus by using the
   keyboard.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The History window has a similar problem. The focus can be switched from this
window to the parent book window with the ALT+TAB key combination, but doing so
will force the history window to become invisible as it will be positioned
behind the parent book window.
