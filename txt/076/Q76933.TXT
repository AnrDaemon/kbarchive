SUMMARY
=======

Resource script statements are documented in Chapter 8 of the Microsoft Windows
SDK version 3.0 "Reference Volume 2" and in chapter 13 of the Microsoft Windows
SDK version 3.10 "Programmer's Reference: Volume 4, Resources" These chapters
include statements such as the following:

   In addition to these styles, the style field may contain any combination
   (or none) of the BUTTON-class styles. Styles can be combined using the
   bitwise OR operator.

This statement, which is repeated a number of times throughout the chapter, is
incorrect; button styles cannot be combined.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The button style identifiers (BS_*) are defined in the WINDOWS.H file as
consecutive integers, not individual bits. If two button styles are combined and
the combination creates a legal button style, the button will be created with
that style. However, if two button styles are combined and the combination does
not create a legal button style, the button will be created, but will not be
painted on the screen.

NOTE: Button styles may be combined with window styles (WS_*) by using the
bitwise OR operator (|).
