TITLE   :FIX: JMP Jumps to the Proc When Using Duplicate Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.0a,6.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) versions 6.0, 6.0a or 6.0b, the JMP
instruction will jump to the procedure name rather than a local label if the
names of the procedure and the local label are identical. After the jump, the
procedure begins running rather than the code at the label.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the problem, create a local label with a name that is different
from the procedure name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM versions 6.0, 6.0a, and
6.0b. This problem was corrected in MASM for MS-DOS version 6.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The sample code below does not generate a syntax error for the identical
procedure name and label name because the label is local to the procedure it is
defined in. If the label is defined with a double colon (::) instead of a single
colon (:), it becomes a global label and causes the assembler to generate an
error. The assembler should generate code that jumps to the local label rather
than the procedure.

Sample Code
-----------

   ; Assemble options needed: none

   .MODEL small
   .STACK 4096

   .DATA

   .CODE
      .startup
      call myproc
      .exit 0

   myproc PROC
      jmp SHORT mylabel
   mylabel:
      ret  ; Should execute this
   myproc ENDP

   mylabel PROC
      ret  ; Shouldn't execute this
   mylabel ENDP

   END
