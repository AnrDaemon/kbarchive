TITLE   :Screen Repainting Problem with Microsoft Mouse Driver
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

   When LAN Manager version 2.0c is installed on MS-DOS version 5.0, netpopups
   halt screen repainting until the screen is cleared using CLS. Only then does
   the screen return to normal.

RESOLUTION
==========

   Replacing MOUSE.COM with the Microsoft Mouse version 7.04 or 8.0 resolves the
   netpopup problem. [Note: Microsoft Mouse version 7.0 resolves this problem;
   however, it is known to produce unrecoverable application errors (UAEs) with
   Windows.]

Additional query words: 2.00c 5.00 8.00
