-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If a disk is formatted with Norton Utilities Safe Format (versions 4.5 through
6.0) with a volume label specified, you may not be able to rename the volume
label with the Microsoft MS-DOS version 5.0 LABEL command.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you use a label with Norton Utilities Safe Format, the MS-DOS 5.0 external
LABEL command (LABEL.COM) cannot change or delete it unless the full syntax of
the label is typed at the prompt (for example, LABEL B:MYDISK).

In other words, if you enter only the LABEL command, the label cannot be changed
or deleted although the command prompts you for a name. If you press ENTER to to
delete the label name, the command carries out the action, but does not change
the name. If you type a name, the following error message is displayed:

   Cannot make directory entry

You can use the Norton Utilities Volume Label command to rename the volume
label.
