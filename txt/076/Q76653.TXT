SUMMARY
=======

Currently, scenery disks for Microsoft Flight Simulator for the Macintosh
versions 1.0 and 4.0 are available from two sources. Sublogic Corporation
produces scenery disks for Flight Simulator version 1.0 (the monochrome
version); contact Sublogic Corporation at (217) 359-8482. Bruce Artwick
Organization produces scenery disks for Flight Simulator version 4.0 (the color

MORE INFORMATION
================

Flight Simulator version 4.0 can load the older monochrome scenery files;
however, the older scenery files were designed for use in a monochrome program.
The colors do not display correctly if you use the older disks on a color
monitor. You may improve the appearance of these older files if you change your
window setting to monochrome by closing the window and then reopening the window
while simultaneously holding down the OPTION key. The new scenery disks work
correctly with Flight Simulator version 4.0.
