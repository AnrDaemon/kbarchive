If the sound interrupt is not set correctly, the sound driver plays
only the first part of the sound, represented by the first 2K of data.
If the sound is being played synchronously, Windows may hang as the
application waits for an event that will never occur.

You should make sure that the interrupt from the Sound Blaster card is
correctly specified in the Driver Setup in the Control Panel. Also,
make sure that the interrupt selected for the Sound Blaster does not
conflict with any other interrupt on your system.
