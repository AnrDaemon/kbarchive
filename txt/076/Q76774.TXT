SUMMARY
=======

The following information is contained in the Windows with Multimedia Extensions
version 1.0 README.TXT file. The Setup program copies this file to the Windows
with Multimedia Extensions directory.

This information does not apply to later versions of Windows.

USING WINDOWS 2.X DRIVERS WITH WINDOWS 3.0
==========================================

Windows 2.x display, mouse, sound, system, and communications drivers
run only in Windows 3.0 real mode. To run Windows 3.0 in standard and
enhanced 386 modes (that also support the Multimedia extensions), you
must update these drivers to run Windows 3.0.

To start Windows in real mode, type the following at the MS-DOS prompt
and press ENTER:

   win /r

If you use Windows 2.x printer drivers with Windows 3.0, you might see
a warning when you print. As with Windows 2.x applications, 2.x
printer drivers work reliably only if you run Windows 3.0 in real
mode.

NOTE: It is recommended that you install only the drivers provided
with Windows 3.0. If you want to use a special device driver that was
not provided with Windows, contact the manufacturer for an updated
driver that works with Windows 3.0.
