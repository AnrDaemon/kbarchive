The following information is contained in the Windows with Multimedia Extensions

USING THE SWAPFILE UTILITY
==========================

Windows 3.0 includes Swapfile, a utility that can dramatically improve
Windows' performance on some computers when you are running in 386
enhanced mode. Swapfile turns a portion of hard disk space into
additional memory. However, Swapfile cannot be used with all hard disk
drives because of the way some drives interact with MS-DOS.

If you want to run Swapfile, see Chapter 4, "Optimizing Your System,"
in Introducing Windows with Multimedia.
