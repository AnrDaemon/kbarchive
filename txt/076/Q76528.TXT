SUMMARY
=======

The tab feature in Microsoft Windows Write 3.0 does not work properly with the
Epson 9-pin driver. When you first edit a document, the tab stops at the Write
default of every half inch. Pressing your TAB key any time past the first hash
mark after the 1-inch mark results in text skipping the 1.5- inch tab stop and
stopping at the 2-inch mark when the Courier font is used.

When you use the Epson 9-pin drivers with Microsoft Windows Write 3.1 , the TAB
key skips tab stops when using Roman 10pt, Times New Roman, and Courier New
Type.The Truetype and Screen fonts in Windows 3.1 work correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you open a new document and you have the Epson 9-pin driver installed,
tabbing is only possible up to the 2.5-inch mark. Erratic tab behavior may occur
regardless of which font is used. The tabs in the Okidata 9-pin drivers stops at
4 inches, and some of the fonts like Courier, Avant Garde, and Bookman also tend
to skip tab stops. When tabs are manually inserted by choosing the Document
menu, the tab stops work correctly.
