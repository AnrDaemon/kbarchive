TITLE   :FIX: Undocumented Separator Property of a VB Menu Item
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::1.0,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may encounter an undocumented property for menu items that allows you to
toggle between the caption and a separator bar. A separator bar in a menu is a
horizontal line that separates menu item groups.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft did not intend to leave the Separator property in the Visual Basic
product.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Separator property is not documented in Visual Basic's manuals or online
Help. Microsoft recommends that you not use the Separator property in your
Visual Basic applications. The Separator property no longer exists in Visual
Basic version 3.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the products listed above. This
problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual Basic version 3.0 for Windows by
removing the Separator property.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Separator Property (Applies to Menu Items)
------------------------------------------

Description: Denotes if a menu item is a separator bar. Prevents
             or allows the value of the Caption property of the
             menu item to be displayed versus a separator bar.

Usage:       [form.][menuitem.]Separator[= boolean%]

Remarks:     The Separator property settings are as follows:

             Setting       Description
             -----------------------------------------------------
             True (-1)     Disables the display of the value of
                           the Caption property as the menu item.
                           Instead, a separator bar is displayed.

             False (0)     (Default) for all other menu items.
                           The menu item will display the value
                           of the Caption property for that item.

             When a menu item is created in the menu design window,
             the value of its separator property defaults to 0 unless
             the caption of that menu item is set to a dash (-), in
             which case, the Separator property defaults to -1 and a
             separator bar is displayed for that item instead of the
             value of the Caption property.
