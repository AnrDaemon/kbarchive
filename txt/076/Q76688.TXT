PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Resource Compiler (RC) is used to compile a resource script, it cannot
locate include files.

CAUSE
=====

The environment variable INCLUDE contains a path that ends in a backslash
(example, set INCLUDE=C:\).

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the declaration of the environment variable to remove the trailing
backslash.

This problem is often caused when the SUBST command is used to specify a logical
drive for a path.
