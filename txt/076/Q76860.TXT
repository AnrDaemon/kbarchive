If an application shortcut key has been assigned to an application
through the application's program information file (PIF), leaving the
Application Shortcut Key field blank does not remove the shortcut key
sequence.

To remove the application shortcut key assigned to an application, do
the following:

1. Double-click PIF EDITOR located in the Accessories group.

2. Open the PIF file for that application.

3. Go to the Application Shortcut Key field in the Advanced Options dialog box
   and press SHIFT+BACKSPACE. The word "None" will now appear in this field.
   (Note: The word "None" cannot be typed into the field by using the keyboard).

4. Save the revised PIF file.
