SUMMARY
=======

The following information is contained in the Windows with Multimedia Extensions
version 1.0 README.TXT file. The Setup program copies this file to the Windows
with Multimedia Extensions directory.

This information does not apply to later versions of Windows.

GIVING MAXIMUM PRIORITY TO AN APPLICATION
=========================================

Windows lets you set the specific amount of processing time your
applications will receive relative to other applications that are
running.

To ensure that a particular application receives all the processing
time it needs without interruption, set its Priority Foreground option
to 10000. With this setting, no background applications will be
allowed to run unless the foreground application is idle.

See the section entitled "Background and Foreground Priority," in the
HyperGuide PIF Editor Options for more information about this setting.
The PIF Editor is part of the Accessories Group in HyperGuide.
