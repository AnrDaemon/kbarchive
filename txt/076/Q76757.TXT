The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 3.1

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the 11-Voice FM Music (AdLib compatible) feature of the
Sound Blaster card hardware and how it works with Microsoft Windows with
Multimedia Extensions version 1.0 or with Windows version 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

FM stands for frequency modulation, which is how the sound is produced. The
Sound Blaster has 11 FM voices (11 notes polyphony), and unlike FM-stereo radio,
the sound is mono only. FM-synthesis produces slightly better sounds than square
wave synthesis, which is what the C/MS (creative music synthesizer) chip set
does.

Digital FM synthesis is used by AdLib, Creative Labs, and most other audio
adapter card producers. The Sound Blaster's FM synthesizer is AdLib compatible.
Both Adlib and Creative Labs (the manufacturer of Sound Blaster) use the FM chip
set produced by Yamaha. The AdLib driver in Windows with Multimedia Extensions
will work with any AdLib-compatible synthesizer, including the Sound Blaster.

The products included here (other than Windows and Windows with Multimedia
Extensions) are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or
reliability.
