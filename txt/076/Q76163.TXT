-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 5.0, 5.10, 5.10a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When using the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 5.0, 5.1, or 5.1a and
generating a cross-reference file, the listing file generated will contain line
numbers. These line numbers do not relate to the line numbers listed in the .MAP
file when specifying the /LINE linker option.

The line number information generated in the .MAP file with the /LINE option
relates to the source file and not to the listing file. Therefore, relying on
the .MAP file to give information relating to assembler-generated listing file
is not valid because listing files contain added information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The sample code below contains two NOP statements to show executable code lines.
The .MAP file contains line number information corresponding to the source
file's executable lines. This is the intended use of the line number information
generated by the .MAP file. It is not intended for these line numbers to relate
to the lines of the listing file.
