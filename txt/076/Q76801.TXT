======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

SideKick versions earlier than 2.0 may conflict with Microsoft MS-DOS version
5.0 or later. The machine may lock up when invoking SideKick or when running
programs such as MS-DOS Shell, MS-DOS Editor, or QBasic. SideKick version 2.0
may solve this problem. It is also recommended that you use the LOADFIX command
with SideKick 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Conflicts with MS-DOS 5.0 and later arise because SideKick versions earlier than
2.0 use file control blocks (FCBs) instead of file handles, which under MS-DOS
version 5.0 and later are handled differently. SideKick 2.0 uses file handles,
which eliminates this problem. Other conflicts may occur because the memory
resident portion of SideKick conflicts with programs such as Shell, Editor, and
QBasic. Shell is most likely to experience problems with earlier versions of
SideKick because it is also a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program.
