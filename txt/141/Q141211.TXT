SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a 32-bit Windows Sockets program that opens and closes multiple
threads in Windows 95, memory is gradually consumed.

Observable symptoms of this "memory leak" may include a swap file growing very
large while the program is running, page faults as Windows 95 tries to keep up
with the growing swap file, and an eventual system halt when all memory is
consumed.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
