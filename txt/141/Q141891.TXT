SYMPTOMS
========

If you have more than one presentation open at a time, and if you try to print
these presentations by clicking the Print button, you may receive the following
error message:

   This is not a valid page range.

Only one of the presentations is printed.

CAUSE

This error occurs if the starting slide number on one of your presentations is
set to something other than 1.

To change the starting slide number on a presentation:

1. On the File menu, click Slide Setup.

2. Change the number in the Number Slides From box.

3. Click OK.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you print a slide by clicking Print on the File menu, you can print each
presentation correctly. However, you have to print each presentation
separately.

You can also print multiple presentations by doing the following:

1. In My Computer or Windows Explorer, hold down the SHIFT key and click more
   than one presentation.

2. Using the right mouse button, click one of the presentations in the
   selection.

3. On the pop-up menu, click Print.
