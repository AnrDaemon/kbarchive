TITLE   :ADT/ODE: Invalid Page Fault in Module ACMSETUP.EXE
PRODUCT :Microsoft Access Distribution Kit
PROD/VER:7.0 97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create disk images for your application using the Setup Wizard, and you
include a shortcut for a Compact or a Repair And Compact of your database and a
shortcut for a Readme or Help file, you may receive an Invalid Page Fault in
module Acmsetup.exe because of a Compact command- line switch that is appended
to your Readme/Help file command line.

CAUSE
=====

The command line that causes the page fault will be in the following format:

   $(FilePath)\readme.txt /compact

-or-

   $(FilePath) \Help.hlp /compact

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, do one of the following:

In Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools:

On the Add Shortcuts Page, click the General Shortcut Properties tab, click "I
would like to specify my own custom command line," and then type
"$(FilePath)\Readme.txt" (without the quotation marks) or "$(FilePath)\Help.hlp"
(without the quotation marks), depending on the file type, in the Command Line
box for both your Readme and your Help file.

In Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit version 7.0:

Select "$"Specify My Own Custom Command Line" from the Command-Line Style section
for both your Readme and your Help file. In the command line, type
"$(FilePath)\Readme.txt" (without the quotation marks) or "$(FilePath)\Help.hlp"
(without the quotation marks), depending on the file type.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. On the ShortCuts screen of the Setup Wizard, click the Add button.

2. On the Database Shortcut Properties tab ( or in the Properties dialog box in
   the ADT version 7.0), select your database in the File To Open box.

3. Type "My Application Compact" (without the quotation marks) in the
   Description box.

4. Click Compact or Repair And Compact on the Database Shortcut Properties tab
   (or in the Database Shortcut Action in the ADT version 7.0).

5. Click Add.

6. Add either a Help file or a Readme file.

7. Type a description for the file.

8. Leave the default of Use Wizard-Provided Command-Line.

   NOTE: In the ODE Setup Wizard, you must click the General Shortcut Properties
   tab to see the default for the Command line.

9. From the list of Shortcuts, select your application's shortcut.

10. Click the Help or Readme shortcut. Note that the command line of the Help or
   Readme file has changed to $(FilePath)\readme.txt /compact or $(FilePath)
   \Help.hlp /compact.

11. Complete the Setup Wizard, and run setup for your custom application. Note
   that you receive an invalid page fault error.
