KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you download the time and time zone information to the Timex Data Link
Watch, the time downloaded to the watch will not match the time that is shown on
the computer.

CAUSE
=====

By default, when you export to the Timex Data Link Watch, the watch gets the
time from the computer prior to invoking the download routine. Depending on the
amount of time for the download of information, the time setting on the watch
may be from 5 seconds to 1 minute slower than the computer's time.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can add the following command to the DATALINK.INI file located in the
Windows directory to have a more accurate download:

      [Settings]
      SyncTime=1
