TITLE   :ADT2: ADT Setup Wizard Could Not Find MS Access Error Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Access Distribution Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.

Although you have a local installation of Microsoft Access, when you attempt to
use the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit Setup Wizard to create disk images,
you may receive the following error message:

   Setup could not find Microsoft Access 2.0 installed locally on your system.
   Please install Microsoft Access 2.0 before installing this application.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure you are using the UTILITY.MDA included with Microsoft Access 2.0. If
you are using a file from any other source, the Setup Wizard may fail.

Also, check the [Options] section of the MSACC20.INI file to be sure that the
path to the UTILITY.MDA is valid. To do so, open any text editor, such as
Notepad. Open the MSACC20.INI file. (This file is located in your Windows
directory). The [Options] section is the first section in the file. An example
of a valid path to the UTILITY.MDA is as follows:

   [Options]
   SystemDB=C:\MSOFFICE\ACCESS\system.mda
   UtilityDB=C:\MSOFFICE\ACCESS\utility.mda
   AllowCustomControls=1
   AllowOLE1LinkFormat=0
