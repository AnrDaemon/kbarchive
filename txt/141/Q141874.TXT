KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbualink97kbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the "Use Address Book" feature in a mail merge document, only some
fields from the contacts list are available to Word.

CAUSE
=====

Some fields in the contacts list do not contain messaging application program
interface (MAPI) properties; therefore, the converter (Wwpab.cnv) that Word uses
to interpret the information from the Personal Address Book does not recognize
these fields.


MORE INFORMATION
================

which address books they can be used with. A maximum of 12 properties can be
used at one time.
