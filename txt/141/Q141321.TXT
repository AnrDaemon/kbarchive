PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Dangerous Creatures for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you open a pop-up window when Dangerous Creatures is playing a movie clip,
the movie may stop and reset.

CAUSE
=====

Some pop-up windows contain sound. When the pop-up window opens, the sound
associated with the window is played automatically. The computer is not capable
of playing both the movie and the sound at the same time, so it stops and resets
the movie to play the sound.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, do one of the following:

1. On the button bar located on the bottom of the screen, click Options.

2. On the Options window, click Sounds.

3. In the Sounds window, remove the check mark from Narration.

   -or-

Avoid opening a pop-up window until the movie has finished playing.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Dangerous Creatures version 1.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you remove the check mark from the Narration option, sound will not play if
a pop-up window is activated, but the movie will continue playing.

Even if the Narration feature has been turned off, you can play the Narration in
the pop-up window at any time by clicking the speaker icon.
