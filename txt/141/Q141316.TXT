PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you relate two tables on a currency field in the data environment of a
report, incorrect data is displayed in a report. The same relation will display
data correctly in a form.

WORKAROUND
==========

Group on STR(<parent_table.currency_field>,20,4).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By running the One-to-Many Form Wizard on two tables using the currency fields
as the relating fields the correct data will be shown.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a new report.

2. Right-click the report, and select Data Environment.

3. Add two tables that contain currency fields (the child table needs to have an
   index on this currency field).

4. Click the currency field in the parent table, and drag it to the currency
   index expression in the child table. A relation is now set.

5. Set the OnetoMany property to True (.T.) in the Properties sheet for the
   relationship.

6. Add a Data Grouping that is based on the currency field. Place some fields
   from the parent table in the Group Header and some fields from the child
   table in the Detail band.

7. Right-click the report, and select Preview. Note that the data is displayed
   incorrectly with respect to the relationship.
