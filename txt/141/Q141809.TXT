If a Microsoft Excel worksheet is deleted before dropping the table in the
worksheet, the following error occurs on the second insert into a created table
of the same name as the deleted table:

If the table is dropped using the SQL statement "drop table table_name" before
the worksheet is deleted, then every thing works fine.

6. Fulldisconnect

7. In Microsoft Excel, open the workbook and delete the sheet that has the
   created table(appended at the end) and save the workbook.
