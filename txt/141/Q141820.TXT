SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to save a movie, you may receive the following error message:

   Due to technical difficulties, we can't save your movie right now

-or-

   Oops, we can't save your movie right now. This may mean you don't have
   permission to change this movie, or that there isn't enough memory or space
   to save it

RESOLUTION
==========

These messages may occur for several reasons. To resolve this problem, check for
one or more of the following:

 - Make sure that you have at least one scene in the movie you are trying to
   save.

 - Make sure that your computer's available memory is sufficient. (Try closing
   all other programs.)

 - Make sure that you have sufficient hard disk space. (Delete unnecessary
   files.)

 - Make sure that Virtual Memory is in use, and that the swap file is of
   sufficient size.

 - Make sure that you have sufficient privileges to write to the location on the
   disk or file server.

For more information on how to perform these tasks in Windows, see your Windows
on-line help or documentation.

If you are attempting to save a movie to a floppy disk, also check the
following:

 - Make sure that you have sufficient room on your floppy disk. (Delete
   unnecessary files.)

 - Check to see if you can save to a different floppy disk.

After you check for and correct any of the above issues, you should be able to
save your 3D Movie Maker file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When 3D Movie Maker saves files, it works with a temporary storage file which is
always saved first to the hard disk. It then copies the temporary file to the
specified folder or disk after the temporary file has been written correctly.
