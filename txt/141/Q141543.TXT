TITLE   :Selected Screen Saver Is Never Displayed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using user profiles in Windows 95, the screen saver you selected
may not consistently activate at the time specified in Display properties.

CAUSE
=====

Registry entries may not be properly updated when a screen saver is selected in
a specific user's profile when no screen saver is selected in the default
profile.


RESOLUTION
==========

Activate the screen saver in the default user profile. To do this, follow these
steps:

1. Restart the computer.

2. When you are prompted to log in, click Cancel. This logs you in as the
   default user.

   NOTE: If no login screen appears, you have chosen to use a blank password. You
   must rename your password list file (<username>.pwl) in the Windows
   folder and then restart Windows 95.

   NOTE: If you are using a personal certificate, you should export it before
   renaming your .pwl file. If you do not do so, it may be unavailable when you
   send e-mail. For more information, see the following article in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:

3. In Control Panel, double-click Display.

4. Click the Screen Saver tab.

5. Select the screen saver you want to use.

6. Click OK.

7. Restart the computer. Log in normally.


STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
