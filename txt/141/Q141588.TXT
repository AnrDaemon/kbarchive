TITLE   :Services Not Closed Properly During Forced Shutdown
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT services are forced to terminate immediately during shutdown.
Therefore some of these services are not closed properly. For example, a UPS
power outage may force a immediate shutdown while the services are running and
cannot properly close the services in less than 20 seconds (forced shutdown time
interval).


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
