SUMMARY
=======

When you double-click a word in Encarta 1996, the definition of the selected
word displays. If no match for the selected word is available, the closest
matching word is highlighted.

Encarta 1996 does not display a definition unless you select one of the listed
words.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by design.

For example, if you display the article discussing the Mexican War and
double-click the word Mexican, the dictionary runs and displays the highlighted
word Mexico. If you select the word Mexico, a definition appears.

Additional query words: multi media multimedia multi-media mmtitles wrong doesn't display show blank double click
