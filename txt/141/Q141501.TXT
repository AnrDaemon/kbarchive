SourceSafe for UNIX.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: SourceSafe for UNIX version 3.02 and Unix are manufactured by a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.

SourceSafe for UNIX version 3.02 requires a Um.dat file containing a valid serial
number. This number is entered by the installation script during the
installation of SourceSafe for Unix. SourceSafe for Windows version 3.04 does
not require a serial number but can use a Um.dat file that contains it. You can
use the following step-by-step procedure to add SourceSafe 3.02 for UNIX to an
existing SourceSafe for Windows 3.04 site:


Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Back up the existing database.

2. Update all existing SourceSafe file names and directory names to lowercase
   names.

3. Install SourceSafe version 3.02 for UNIX.

4. Set the SSDIR and PATH variables.

5. Run the following commands:

   %serializ data -s123-654-789
   %ddconv date

6. Reset the project and users rights if they are different from the default
   settings.
