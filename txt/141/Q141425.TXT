TITLE   :FIX: Toolbar Events Fire Differently When Using Dock Method
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The BeforeDock, Undock, and AfterDock events are not triggered in the same order
when a toolbar is docked interactively versus when a toolbar is docked under
program control.

When the dock position of a toolbar is changed interactively, the events fire in
the following order:

      BeforeDock, AfterDock

When the dock position of a toolbar is changed under program control with the
Dock method, the events fire in the following order:

      BeforeDock, Undock, BeforeDock, AfterDock

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.

WORKAROUND
==========

There is no way to prevent the events from occurring, or to trigger the events
under program control. However, if you have code for the BeforeDock and Undock
methods and do not want to call it when the Dock method is executed, follow
these steps:

1. Add a property to the class called lDockit.

2. In the Dock method, set the value of this property to true (.T.) as in this
   example:

      IF THIS.DockPosition != -1 && The toolbar is already docked
         THIS.lDockit=.T.
      ENDIF

3. In the event handler for BeforeDock, add the following:

      IF THIS.lDockit <> .T.
         <your code here>
      ENDIF

4. In the event handler for Undock, add the following:

      IF THIS.lDockit<>.T.
         <your code here>
         ELSE
         THIS.lDockit=.F.
      ENDIF

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Type CREATE CLASS in the Command window.

2. In the Create Class dialog box, enter the following information to create a
   class based on the Toolbar class:

      ClassName: TbrDock
      Based On : select Toolbar
      Store In : Clstbar

3. In the Class Designer, enter the following line for the AfterDock,
   BeforeDock, and Undock event handlers:

      =MESSAGEBOX(PROGRAM())

4. Save the class.

5. Create a toolbar object by typing the following code in the Command window:

      SET CLASSLIB TO clstbar
      oTrdock=CREATEOBJECT("TbrDock")
      oTrdock.Show

6. Use the mouse to dock the toolbar. The BeforeDock and AfterDock events fire.

7. From the Command window, call the Dock method to move to another docked
   position:

      oTrDock.Dock(1)

   The BeforeDock, Undock, BeforeDock, and AfterDock events are triggered.
