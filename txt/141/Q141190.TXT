TITLE   :Disk Administrator Stops When Zip Drive is Present
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When entering Disk Administrator, Dr. Watson appears and notes that there has
been an error in the application and that it will be closed. This occurs when a
zip drive is present and while the progress bar titled "Disk Administrator is
Initializing" is present.

CAUSE
=====

A zip drive is the only (or first) device on the SCSI controller with the lowest
base I/O address, making it the controller that is queried first by Disk
Administrator. The failure occurs only if there is not a disk in the zip drive.
Otherwise, the media will be properly reported as Drive 0, with its size and
appropriate logical drive letter.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are a few solutions:

 - Always insert a disk into the zip drive before launching Disk Administrator.

 - Connect the zip drive to the SCSI controller that the system's hard disk
   drives are connected to and remove the secondary controller.

 - If possible, set the I/O address of the secondary controller to be higher (in
   hexadecimal) than the address of the controller with the system's hard disk
   drive(s).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.


MORE INFORMATION
================

This occurs when two SCSI controllers are present in a system. PCI-based SCSI
controllers are given very high I/O addresses (such as FC00 - FCFF), so any
additional ISA or EISA SCSI controller present in the system will have the lower
address. When Disk Administrator cannot find the media for this first device, an
error occurs.
