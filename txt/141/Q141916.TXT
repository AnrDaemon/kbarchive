TITLE   :Command Button Properties Differ Between Versions
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbcode

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The default values of the FontSize, FontName, and FontBold properties of command
buttons differs between Far East versions of Visual FoxPro and other versions of
Visual FoxPro 3.0 and 3.0b.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following table describes how the FontName, FontBold, and FontSize default
values between Far East versions and the versions offered in other countries.

Property      World     Far East
FontName      Arial     Country specific
FontBold      .T.       .F.
FontSize      10        9

The following code displays the FontName, FontSize, and FontBold property values
on the Visual FoxPro desktop. The different property values between versions may
be of concern if developing an international version of an application. These
differences could potentially cause a display problem , such as, "Position is
off of screen" message, if the variance is not taken into account.

      tform = CreateObject("form")
      tform.AddObject("C1","commandbutton")
      ACTIVATE SCREEN
      ? "Fontname of commandbutton = "
      ?? tform.c1.FontName
      ? "Fontsize of commandbutton = "
      ?? tform.c1.FontSize
      ? "Fontbold of commandbutton = "
      ?? tform.c1.FontBold
