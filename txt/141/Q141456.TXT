-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1

SYMPTOMS
========

Pressing the F1 key on a compiler error or warning in the output window does not
bring up help for the error unless the caret is positioned on the error number.
If there is no match in Books Online for the word the caret is on, a message
similar to this appears:

   The keyword "<keyword>" was not found.
   Choose OK to see the closest match to "<keyword>" in the Visual C++
   Books Online 4.0 keyword index.

RESOLUTION
==========

To view the help text for an error message, make sure the caret is on the error
number, and then press the F1 key.

STATUS
======

This bug was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++, version 6.0.
