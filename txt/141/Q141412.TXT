SYMPTOMS
========

If your computer system has a Sound Blaster 8-bit sound card installed and you
attempt to run the Encarta 1995 MindMaze game, your system may hang (stop
responding). No error message is displayed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use one of the following two methods to turn the MindMaze Music and Sound
Effects off.

Method 1
--------

1. On the MindMaze menu, click the Sound Option.

2. Click the Off option for both Music and Sound Effects.

3. Click OK to close the Sound Options dialog box.

   NOTE: Method 1 only works if MindMaze does not hang when starting. If MindMaze
   hangs when starting, use Method 2 to turn off sounds.

Method 2
--------

1. Using a text editor such as Notepad in Windows 3.x, or WordPad in Windows 95,
   open the Encarta.ini file located in your Windows folder.

2. In the [Mindmaze95] section, change the following entries:

   SoundOn=0
   MusicOn=0

   NOTE: If your Encarta.ini file does not include a [MindMaze95] section, add
   the section with the above lines at the bottom of the file.
