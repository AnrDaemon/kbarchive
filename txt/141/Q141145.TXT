TITLE   :PRB: APPEND FROM to Logical Field Loads Literal t or y Values
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbcode

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the the following command saves literal "t" and "y" values as false in a
logical field:

      APPEND FROM <textfile> TYPE DELIMITED

CAUSE
=====

The APPEND FROM command does not recognize lowercase "t" or "y" as valid logical
values.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the table structure of the logical field to a character field. After
appending the records to the table, change the structure of the character field
back to a logical field.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce & Resolve Behavior
-------------------------------------

The following program converts all the logical fields in a table to character
fields. Records are appended to the table from a text file. All of the records
in character field are converted to uppercase and switched back to logical field
type.

1. Create a new text file called Mytext.txt. There should be no spaces, tabs, or
   periods on each line. Type the following exactly as shown:

   " T
   F
   t
   f
   Y
   y
   N
   n" (without the quotation marks)

2. Open a program file and type the following lines of code into it:

      CREATE TABLE TABLE1 (FIELD1 L)
      DIMENSION laMyarray(fcount())
      laMyarray=.F.
      FOR lnI = 1 TO FCOUNT()
         IF TYPE(FIELD(lnI)) = "L"
            laMyarray(lnI)=.T.
            lcFld=FIELD(lnI)
            ALTER TABLE TABLE1 ALTER COLUMN &lcFld c(1)
         ENDIF
      ENDFOR
      APPEND FROM mytext.txt TYPE DELIMITED
      FOR lnI=1 to FCOUNT()
         IF laMyarray(lnI)
            lcFld=FIELD(lnI)
            REPLACE ALL &lcFld WITH UPPER(&lcFld)
            ALTER TABLE TABLE1 ALTER COLUMN &lcFld L
         ENDIF
      ENDFOR

3. Save and close the program.

4. In the Command window, type:

      DO <Myprogram>
      BROWSE

   Notice that the logical fields now correctly display T or F.
