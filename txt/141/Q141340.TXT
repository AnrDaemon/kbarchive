======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you run a Simple Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI)
application that makes a call to MAPILogon in Microsoft Exchange, the profile
name must be passed in the Name field of the function.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MAPI version 1.0 messaging systems require the profile name. The profile name is
required, because it contains critical information, such as the mailbox name and
all transport providers supported by that session.

NOTE: Versions 3.x of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks require only the name field
to pass the mailbox name and only support one transport provider at a time.
