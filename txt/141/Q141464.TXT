 - Use underscores instead of spaces in the file name of the document the Word
   document is embedded in, as in the following example:

   The_name_of_a_new_sample_file.doc

   -or-

 - Use capital letters instead of spaces to delimit the words in the file name,
   as in the following example:

   TheNameOfANewSampleFile.doc

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Word 97 for Windows. This
problem was corrected in Microsoft Office 97 Service Release 2 (SR-2).

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you embed an unnamed Word document in another document, when the embedded
document is opened, Word uses the name of the container document in the window
title bar. If the name of the container document is 28 or more characters long
and contains one or more blanks, the name displayed may be blank or may be a
portion of the container document name that does not include the first
characters of the container document name.
