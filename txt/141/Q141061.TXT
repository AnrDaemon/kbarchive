SUMMARY
=======

Before you start a Simple Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI)
session with a MAPI application, you may need to determine if Simple MAPI is
available on the system.

One way to see if Simple MAPI is available is to check the [Mail] section in the
WIN.INI file for the MAPI entry. This entry will have a value of 1 if Simple
MAPI is installed; 0 if it is not installed. For example, the entry will be the
following if Simple MAPI is available:

   [Mail]
   MAPI=1

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the release of MAPI version 1.0, you should also check the MAPIX entry for
the availability of Extended MAPI, CMC entry for Common Mail Calls, and
OLEMessaging for OLE Messaging.

For example, the following entries are for Extended MAPI:

   [Mail]
   MAPI=1
   MAPIX=1
   CMC=1
   OLEMessaging=1

NOTE: Microsoft Windows 95 and Microsoft Windows NT use the WIN.INI file for
backward compatibility.
