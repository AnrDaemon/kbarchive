======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you add multiple SCSI adapters with Windows NT, it is possible to give disk
0 a drive letter other than C:.

This is because Windows NT gives the drive letters according to the order that
the SCSI device driver is loaded, which is determined by the tag order of that
driver. By changing the tag order of that driver, you can change the order of
which driver is loaded.

Step-by-Step Procedure
----------------------

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

   \System\CurrentControlSet\Services\%adaptername%

   You will see a parameter called TAG on the right-hand side of the split
   screen.

3. Select the TAG value, and press ENTER to open the DWORD editor.

4. Reset the values in the fields. The lowest number should be the adapter you
   want to have initialized first.

5. Shut down and restart Windows NT.

6. Run Disk Administrator to verify changes were made correctly.
