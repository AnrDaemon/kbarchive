MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form, and drop an OLE Container Control onto it. Select Insert
   Control for the OLE Container, and select Outline Control for the Control
   Type.

2. Add Vfp\Samples\Data\Employee.dbf to the Data Environment, and set the Order
   property of the Employee cursor to L_NAME.

3. Place the following code in the form's Init event:

      SELECT Employee
      GO TOP
      FOR lnI=1 to RECCOUNT()
        THISFORM.OLECONTROL1.ADDITEM(last_name,lnI)
        THISFORM.OLECONTROL1.INDENT(lnI)=1
        SKIP
      ENDFOR
      THISFORM.REFRESH

4. Inside the Outline Control's DBLCLICK event, type the following:

       =SEEK(THISFORM.OLECONTROL1.LIST(THISFORM.OLECONTROL1.LISTINDEX))

5. Open the Debug Window and type the following on the left side:

      RECNO()

6. In the Command window, type:

      SET STATUS BAR ON

7. Run the form.

8. Double-click any item in the outline control. The Debug Window correctly
   displays the current record number. The Status Bar isn't updated with the
   current record number. For the status bar to be updated, place the focus
   outside the outline control.
