The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

All methods are read-only at run time. You can, however, have several methods
and decide at run time which method to execute. This article shows you how.

================

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a new form.

2. Place a command button (Command1) on the form, and add the following code to
   its Click event:

      lcTemp=ThisForm.gcCurrentclk
      &lcTemp

3. Place an Option Group on the form, and add the following code to its Click
   event:

      IF This.Value=1
        ThisForm.gcCurrentclk="ThisForm.Click1"
      ELSE
        ThisForm.gcCurrentclk="ThisForm.Click2"
      ENDIF

4. Create a new form property called gcCurrentclk, and assign ThisForm.Click1 to
   gcCurrentclk.

5. Create a new Form method called Click1, and place the following in the
   Form.Click1 method:

      WAIT WINDOW "Click #1"

6. Create a new method called Click2, and place the following code in the
   Form.Click2 method:

      WAIT WINDOW "Click #2"

7. Run the form.

The option group determines which Click method for the command button will
execute.

NOTE: The Click event for the command button does not have to be a method of the
current form. For example:

   gcCurrentclk="DO myprog.PRG" would execute a program.
   gcCurrentclk="oMyclass.Click1" would execute a method of an external class.
   gcCurrentclk="WAIT WINDOW" would execute a wait window.
