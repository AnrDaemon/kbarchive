SYMPTOMS
========

In Encarta 1995, when you attempt to use the Copy or Print features from the
"Further Reading" section of an article, the functionality is not available.

CAUSE
=====

Copy and Print options are unavailable in the Further Reading section of an
Encarta 1995 for the Macintosh article.

RESOLUTION
==========

To print the Further Reading section in an Encarta 1995 article, do the
following:

1. Open the Further Reading window.

2. Press the SHIFT+APPLE+3 key combination.

   NOTE: The SHIFT+APPLE+3 key combination takes a picture of the screen and
   places the capture in a file located on your hard disk. The file is named
   Picture, followed by a number which corresponds to the number of pictures
   taken. In this example the file name is referred to as Picture 1.

3. Open a program that recognizes graphic files, such as Microsoft Works, and
   open the Picture 1 file from within the program.

4. Print the image from within the program you have chosen.

STATUS
======

The problem is corrected in Microsoft Encarta for the Macintosh, 1996 and later
versions.
