TITLE   :DHCP Client Reserved Name and Comment Changed by Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you reserve a client IP address in DHCP Server Manager and assign a "Client
Name" and/or "Client Comment" the fields change.

CAUSE
=====

When the client receives the reserved address from the DHCP server, the "Client
Name" field is replaced with the NetBIOS name of the client computer. This is
intentional. The DHCP database should always contain the actual client
information.

When the client requests the address, the contents of the "Client Comment" field
are eliminated under certain circumstances.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5, 3.51,
and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
