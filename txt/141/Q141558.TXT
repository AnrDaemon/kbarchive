TITLE   :FIX: WindowType Changed at Run Time Can't Be Changed Back
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You attempt to change the WindowType of a running form from modeless to modal
and then back to modeless. On the switch from modeless to modal, you succeed.
But the attempt to switch the now modal form to modeless fails.

WORKAROUND
==========

Although there isn't much call to do this at run time, the switch is one way
only. There is no way to programmatically change it back.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The WindowType of a form should be a property you set a design time; not run
time.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a new form, and set the form's WindowType property to Modeless.

2. Place a command button on the form. In the Click method, add the following
   line of code:

         THISFORM.SHOW(1)

3. Change the Caption property to Modal. Place a second command button on the
   form, and add the following code to its Click event:

         THISFORM.SHOW(2)

4. Change the Caption property to Modeless. Place a third command button on the
   form. Change its Caption property to Release, and add the following code to
   its Click event:

         THISFORM.RELEASE

5. Run the form. If you click the Release command button, the form closes as
   expected. If you click the Modal command button, the form becomes modal. You
   may test this by trying to click outside of the form and noting you are
   unable to activate anything outside of the form or access any other part of
   the Windows interface. If you then click the Modeless command button, the
   form does not return to a modeless WindowType. The form remains modal. The
   Release command button does not release the form. You must cancel the program
   to exit.
