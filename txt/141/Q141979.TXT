SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to legal-size paper on a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet IIP or
IIIP printer with a PostScript cartridge, you may experience one or more of the
following problems:

 - The document is not printed.

 - The top portion of the page is not printed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To print to legal-size paper on an HP LaserJet IIP or IIIP printer with a
PostScript cartridge, follow these steps:

1. Format the document for legal-size paper and select the Manual Feed paper
   source. Do not use the Auto Select Tray paper source. This source defaults to
   the size of paper in the standard paper tray.

2. Print the document.

3. When you see the message "MF FEED LEGAL" in the printer's display window,
   make sure that legal-size paper is loaded in the MP tray and then press the
   ONLINE button on the printer once. Do not press ALT+CONTINUE. Pressing
   ALT+CONTINUE informs the printer that you do not have the requested paper
   size and to use the default paper.

NOTE: The above steps have been tested with an HP PostScript cartridge. These
steps may or may not work with third-party PostScript cartridges.
