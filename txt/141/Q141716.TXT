SYMPTOMS
========

When using the 32-bit ODBC driver for Oracle that is distributed with Visual C++
4.0, you may see the following message in your debug output window:

   

   Warning: SQLExtendedFetch not supported by driver
   and/or cursor library not loaded. Opening forwardOnly.

You may also experience an unhandled exception accompanied by the following
messages in your debug output window:

   

   Error: failure updating record

   Function sequence error
   State:S1010,Native:0,Origin:[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager]

   First-chance exception in MyExe.exe (MFCD40D.DLL): 0xE06D7363:
   Microsoft C++ Exception

   Recordset is read-only

   First-chance exception in MyExe.exe (MFCD40D.DLL): 0xE06D7363:
   Microsoft C++ Exception

CAUSE
=====

You are attempting to open and use a CRecordset object as a dynaset.

The driver does not support the ODBC API function SQLExtendedFetch.
SQLExtendedFetch is required by SQLSetPos and SQLSetPos is required to provide
dynasets.

CRecordset::OnSetOptions() queries the driver to see if SQLExtendedFetch is
available. When it finds that SQLExtendedFetch isn't available, it opens the
recordset as forwardonly. This generates the first warning message.

The last two error messages listed occur when you call CRecordset::Edit() to edit
a record.

The rest of the error messages occur when you call CRecordset::AddNew() and
CRecordset::Update to add a record.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can use snapshots to create a scrollable, updatable recordset. The ODBC
Cursor Library is loaded when using snapshots, which provides the functionality
needed for a scrollable, updatable recordset.
