======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use the MS-DOS client 3.0 with the Cogent EM110 PCI network card,
TCPIP, NWLINK or NetBEUI does not work. However, the network interface card
(NIC) works fine with Windows NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Drvlib (currently Windows NT 3.51) does not have a driver for the Cogent
EM110 PCI network card. The one off the distribution disk that was shipped with
the Lan card must be used for the MS-DOS client. When using the three protocols
listed above, you will see the following symptoms:

   NetBEUI - Binds and loads, but is not be able to connect to anyone

   NWLink - Same symptoms as NetBEUI

   TCPIP - Hangs when loading TCPTSR.EXE.

WORKAROUND
==========

Cogent Tech support has a new NDIS2 driver on their BBS and CompuServe forum (GO
Cogent) that fixes this problem with their NDIS2 driver.

EM110 is manufactured by and is a trademark of Cogent Corporation, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this product's performance or reliability.
