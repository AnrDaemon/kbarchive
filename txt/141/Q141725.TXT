======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

By design, an AppWizard-generated MDI application will display a new MDI child
window on startup. To turn off this feature, an application needs to use
CCommandLineInfo::FileNothing as the shell command when calling the
ProcessShellCommand() function.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The enum value CCommandLineInfo::FileNothing is missing from the online
documentation of CCommandLineInfo::m_nShellCommand. However, its definition can
be found in the header file \Msdev\Mfc\Include\Afxwin.h.

The ProcessShellCommand() function is called by InitInstance() of any
CWinApp-derived class, so you can use the following sample code to disable the
creation of a new MDI child window at startup:

Sample Code
-----------

   BOOL CMyWinApp::InitInstance()
       {
       ...

       // Parse command line for standard shell commands, DDE, file open
       CCommandLineInfo cmdInfo;
       ParseCommandLine(cmdInfo);

       // Don't display a new MDI child window during startup
       if (cmdInfo.m_nShellCommand == CCommandLineInfo::FileNew)
         cmdInfo.m_nShellCommand = CCommandLineInfo::FileNothing;

       // Dispatch commands specified on the command line
       if (!ProcessShellCommand(cmdInfo))
           return FALSE;

       ...
       }
