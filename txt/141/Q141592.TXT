SYMPTOMS
========

Event ID: 56 appears in the SNA Server Application log when you have Distributed
Link Services (DLS) connected to an AS/400. Detail information from of the event
is:

   Event 56: Connection <connection> failed: XID rejected by remote
   computer

The connection becomes Pending, but never becomes active. The AS/400 shows an
error such as (use DSPMSG QSYSOPR to view AS/400 system operator messages):

   CPA575D: Controller CNIRV02 on line ETHLINE not contacted. Probable
   configuration problem.

Refer to Release Notes for Microsoft SNA Server V.2.11 Service Pack 1 for more
information on DLS.

CAUSE
=====

The AS/400 does not create a second controller for the same MAC address and the
same RSAP (Remote Source Access Point). This is defined in SNA Server as the
link service SAP in SNA Server Setup, not the connection's Remote SAP Address.
If there is a controller already created for a particular line that shares a MAC
address and RSAP with a pending connection, the AS/400 attempts to use the
existing controller. This does not present a problem if the SNA Server Control
Point Name and MAC address on the SNA Server match the Control Point Name and
LAN Remote Adapter Address respectively on the AS/400 controller description.
Otherwise, the AS/400 generates an error message that states that there was a
problem activating the offending controller.

RESOLUTION
==========

Either (1) reconfigure the controller on the AS/400 to match the desired
parameters, or (2) delete the controller on the AS/400 and allow it to auto-
create, or (3) match the Control Point Name of the SNA Server using the SNA
Admin tool only if the Control Point Name is not in use by any other device.
