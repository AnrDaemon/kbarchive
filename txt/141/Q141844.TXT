Installing Components
---------------------

To install new network components while another network configuration is
installed, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Network.

2. On the Configuration tab, click Add, click the type of component you want to
   add, and then click Add.

3. Click the appropriate manufacturer and model for the component you are
   adding, and then click OK. If there is no driver for the component you are
   adding, click Have Disk and install the driver from a disk supplied by the
   manufacturer of the component.

4. Click OK.

5. If you want to add other components, repeat steps 2-4.

Changing Computer Name or Workgroup Name
----------------------------------------

To change the computer name or workgroup name, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Network.

2. Click the Identification tab.

3. Type the names you want to use in the Computer Name and Workgroup boxes.

4. Click OK.

Choosing Share-Level or User-Level Security
-------------------------------------------

To choose share-level or user-level security (or access control) while a network
is installed, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Network.

2. Click the Access Control tab.

3. Click either the Share-Level Access Control or the User-Level Access Control
   option. If you choose the User-Level Access Control option, you must specify
   a server in the "Obtain list of users and groups from" box from which a list
   of users can be obtained.

   NOTE: You should choose user-level access control only if there is a Microsoft
   Windows NT workstation, Windows NT server, or Novell NetWare server on the
   network.

4. Click OK.
