TITLE   :FAX: Err Msg: Failure to Submit Fax
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax, version 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have insufficient rights on a Novell network environment or if the CAS
driver rejected a fax with an attachment, you may get the following error
message:

   Failure to submit fax

CAUSE
=====

The above error may be caused by the following situations:

 - In a Novell network environment, a new installation of the Microsoft Gateway
   to Fax may not work successfully. This problem may be caused by insufficient
   access rights.

 - If the Fax Gateway has been working, you can still get the above error
   message on the gateway screen and in the FAXGATE.LOG file. This may be
   related to specific faxed item(s) (with attachments rejected by the CAS
   driver during submission).

RESOLUTION
==========


In a Novell network environment:

1. Add the user FAXGTW to a user group granted the proper access rights.

   This group should have the RWCEM and F rights.

2. Give the FAXGTW individual account the RWCEM and F rights.

   If you are not on a Novell network environment, please see the following
   article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q130447 FAX: Err Msg: "Failure to Submit Fax!" on Every Faxout Cycle

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you get the above error message with a new installation, and the access
rights mentioned above are correct, then de-install and reinstall all the Fax
Gateway components. Make sure you delete and remove any previous occurrence of
the Intel SatisFAXtion files and any path referring to them. There should be
only one occurrence of those files.

Once you have installed the Intel SatisFAXtion software, you cannot move or copy
files to another location. The installation location is coded into the .EXE file
and can only be changed by reinstalling.
