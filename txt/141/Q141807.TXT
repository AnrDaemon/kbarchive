TITLE   :BUG: RPC NetBIOS Calls Fail over RAS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When RPC calls attempt to register a NetBIOS protocol sequence as an endpoint
with Remote Access Services (RAS) installed, you may receive error messages such
as error 1704 "The RPC protocol sequence is invalid" or error 1720 "The endpoint
cannot be created."

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs because RAS incorrectly enters some information in the
registry when installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Taking the RPC-related RAS entries out of the registry resolves this issue.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start the Registry Editor.

2. Select the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree.

3. Go to the SOFTWARE\Microsoft\RPC\NetBIOS key.

4. To the right you will see the protocol sequences that can be registered by an
   RPC application. For a machine with a single network card and RAS, you may
   see:

   ncacn_nb_tcp0
   ncacn_nb_nb0
   ncacn_nb_ipx0
   ncacn_nb_tcp1
   ncacn_nb_nb1
   ncacn_nb_ipx1

   These values will have a dword that signifies the binding order. If the
   network adapter driver was installed prior to RAS (most likely), remove all
   the sequences that end in 1. The sequences are written to the registry in the
   order the device driver was installed, so you must know the order in which
   network cards and RAS were installed. Once the RAS bound protocol sequences
   are removed, the RPC calls will always go over the RAS link when a call is
   made.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
