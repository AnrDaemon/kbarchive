The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2

SYMPTOMS
========

The Project Workspace window is not accessible from the toolbar, toolbar context
menu, View menu, or the keyboard ViewWorkspaceWindow command (ALT+0). Trying to
gain access to the workspace by using one of these methods causes an illegal
operation in MSDEV.EXE.

On Windows 95 the error reads:

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.

Selecting the details button reveals an invalid page fault in module MSVCSHL.DLL

On Windows NT version 3.51, the error reads:

   An application error has occurred

   MSDEV.EXE
   Exception: access violation (0x00000005), Address: 0x50012861


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, do not enable docking view for the Project
Workspace window while it is hidden.

STATUS
======

beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.
