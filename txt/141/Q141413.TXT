TITLE   :FIX: MSDEV Does Not Prompt for Executable for Debug Session
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0,4.1,4.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage kbDebug kbide kbVC500fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start a debugging session in Developer Studio (MSDEV) and
the target being debugged is a DLL or an OCX, Developer Studio will prompt you
for an executable for the debug session if you have not specified one. If
Developer Studio cannot find the executable you specify, it will display an
error message but will continue to try to use the incorrect executable name each
time you attempt to debug. So from this point on, Developer Studio will not give
you the opportunity to correct the name, it will just display an error message
each time you attempt to debug.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this behavior, you need to explicitly change the "Executable for
debug session" setting in the build settings for the project. On the Build menu,
click Select Settings, select the debug target, click the debug tab, and select
General in the Category box. You can now correct the name specified in the
"Executable for debug session" box. Be sure to include the .exe extension after
the name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.
