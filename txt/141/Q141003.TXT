======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In versions of Visual C++ older than 4.0, m_templateList was a public member of
CWinApp. Starting with Visual C++ 4.0 (MFC 4.0) m_templateList is no longer
accessible. m_templateList is a CPtrList object that contains a list of pointers
to an application's document templates (CDocTemplate). CWinApp now provides
public member functions for accessing the document templates
CWinApp::GetFirstDocTemplatePosition() and CWinApp::GetNextDocTemplate(). You
can use these functions to iterate through the list of CDocTemplate objects.

MORE INFORMATION
================

m_templateList is now a protected member of CDocManager, which is in turn a
public member of CWinApp.

Sample Code
-----------

   void CMyApp::DocTemplatesLoop()
   {
        // this section iterates through all document templates
        POSITION pos = GetFirstDocTemplatePosition();
        while (pos)
        {
             CDocTemplate* pTemplate = GetNextDocTemplate(pos);
             // use pTemplate
        }
   }
