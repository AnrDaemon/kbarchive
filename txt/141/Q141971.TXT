Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form.

2. Add a pageframe to the form.

3. Set the PageCount property of the pageframe to 0.

4. Create a new program file that contains the following code:

      SET PROCEDURE TO <this program>
      DO FORM <form name>
      _SCREEN.FORMS(1).PAGEFRAME1.ADDOBJECT("Page1","Page1")
      _SCREEN.FORMS(1).PAGEFRAME1.ADDOBJECT("Page2","Page1")
      _SCREEN.FORMS(1).REFRESH

      DEFINE CLASS Page1 AS PAGE
      ADD OBJECT command1 AS COMMANDBUTTON
      ENDDEFINE

5. Run the program. A form with two pages should appear.

6. In the Command window, type:

       _SCREEN.FORMS(1).PAGEFRAME1.PAGE1.PAGEORDER=3

   The error "Expression evaluated to an illegal value" appears

7. In the Command window, type:

       _SCREEN.FORMS(1).PAGEFRAME1.PAGE1.PAGEORDER=2

   No error appears
