TITLE   :FIX: FoxPro Quits When It Runs Out of File Handles
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:3.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When FoxPro runs out of file handles, it quits and displays the followin message
instead of giving an error message stating that there are too many files open:

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down

CAUSE
=====

FoxPro is trying to get another file handle to display the error message. Error
messages in version 3.0b are now memory-based instead of file-based, so the "too
many files open" message is displayed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual
FoxPro version 3.0b for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Run the following program:

      CLOSE DATA ALL
      ON ERROR *   && no error messages will be displayed
      FOR I=1 TO 255
        CREATE CURSOR "CURS"+ALLTRIM(STR(I)) (fld1 I, fld2 C(10))
      ENDFOR
      ON ERROR       && set error routines back to default

2. After the program runs, add a few lines to it such as wait windows, and then
   press CTRL+W to close the program.

You may need to run the program more than once to see the failure. Trying to open
other windows such as the debug window may also cause the error after the
program has run.
