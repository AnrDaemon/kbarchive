SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to configure Windows 95 so that double-clicking a
folder opens the Find tool, rather than opening a window displaying the contents
of the folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Causing the Find tool to open when you double-click a folder may be useful if
you often must find files or documents in folders containing a large number of
files.

Note that changing this setting affects all folders.

To cause the Find tool to open when you double-click a folder, follow these
steps:

1. Double-click My Computer.

2. On the View menu, click Options.

3. Click the File Types tab.

4. In the Registered File Types box, click File Folder, and then click Edit.

5. In the Actions box, click Find, and then click Set Default.

6. Click Close, and then click Close.

After you follow these steps, double-clicking a folder causes the Find tool to
open. To open a window displaying the folder's contents, use the right mouse
button to click the folder, and then click Open on the menu that appears.
