PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.10

KEYWORDS:kbBug kbISS

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 2.10 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG#: 3187 (ODBCSDK2)

SYMPTOMS
========

When 32-bit ODBC applications that call the Installer API (ODBCCP32.DLL) are run
under the Win32s subsystem in a Windows for Workgroups (WFW) version 3.11
environment, the following error occurs:

   Initialization of a DLL failed, the process is terminating abnormally, cannot
   run program, unexpected error: 21.

WORKAROUND
==========

The application will run successfully if ODBCCP32.DLL is replaced with the
version of the DLL file from the ODBC 2.0 components (these components ship with
Visual C++ 2.0).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in ODBCCP32.DLL (Thunking DLL)
version 2.10.2401. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To reproduce this problem:

Build the following program to create a 32-bit EXE file (Add ODBC32.LIB and
ODBCCP32.LIB to the link libraries in projectsettings):

   #include <windows.h>
   #include <sql.h>
   #include <sqlext.h>
   #include <odbcinst.h>

   int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hinst,HINSTANCE pinst,LPSTR szCmd,int nShow)
   {
      if (SQLConfigDataSource(NULL,ODBC_ADD_DSN,
         "SQL Server","DSN=Oof\0Server=Oof\0\0"))
      {
         MessageBox(NULL,"SQLConfigDataSource succeeded",
            "SQLConfigDataSource",MB_OK);
      }
      else
      {
         MessageBox(NULL,"SQLConfigDataSource failed",
            "SQLConfigDataSource",MB_OK);
      }
      return 0;
   }

Install the Win32s subsystem from the Win32 SDK on a WFW 3.11 computer. Run the
program on Win32s with the ODBC 2.10a or 2.10b components (these ship with VC++
2.1,2.2, and 4.0). It will fail to load with a message that a DLL could not load
or something similar (depends on the version of Win32s).
