TITLE   :PRB: Listbox Does Not Automatically Display Correct Row
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:3.00 3.00b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The list box does not initially highlight the correct row until it has received
the focus. The list box is always scrolled to the top of the list.

WORKAROUND
==========

Inside the list box Init event, type this code:

      THIS.REQUERY()

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form.

2. Add the following tables to the Data Environment:

      Customer   (Located in VFP/SAMPLES/DATA/)
      Orders     (Located in VFP/SAMPLES/DATA/)

   NOTE: The tables should not be related.

3. Add a text box to the form. The text box should prevent the list box from
   receiving the focus when the form is run.

4. Add a list box to the form, and change the following properties:

      ColumnCount    =  2
      ColumnWidth    =  0,100
      ControlSource  =  ORDERS.CUST_ID
      RowSource      =  CUSTOMER.CUST_ID,CONTACT
      RowSourceType  =  FIELDS

5. Run the form. Note that the list box is scrolled to the top and no row is
   highlighted. If you press the TAB key to move to the list box, the correct
   row is highlighted.
