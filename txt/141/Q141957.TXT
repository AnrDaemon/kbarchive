or whatever setting is appropriate.

1. Run the following code to create a sample table for use with the Form
   Wizard:

      SET SAFETY OFF
      CLOSE ALL
      CLEAR ALL
      CLEAR
      CREATE TABLE mytable (Project C(5), Company C(40), DolrAmt F(14,8))
      INSERT INTO mytable VALUES ("00001","Acme Inc.",1234567.23)
      INSERT INTO mytable VALUES ("00002","Weatherford Inc.",75232.33243)

   from record to record, the amount shown for Acme, Inc. will be displayed as
   asterisks.
