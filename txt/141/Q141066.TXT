-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you start Schedule+ version 7.0 in Microsoft Windows 95 with a Messsaging
Application Programming Interface (MAPI) mail-system installed, a Group Mode
dialog box appears, and asks you to choose one of the following options:

1. Yes, work in group-mode (default)

2. No, work alone

The dialog box also contains a Do Not Ask Again check box and three buttons: OK,
Cancel, and Help.

If you select the check box Do Not Ask Again, this dialog box will not appear
again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solve. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

To force Schedule+ 7.0 to ask the question about Group Mode requires changing an
entry in the Windows 95 registry.

In the Windows 95 registry, go to:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Schedule+\Application

If you see an entry for MAPIPresent=1, then you have selected the option Do Not
Ask Again. To be asked again, you can change the entry to MAPIPresent=0.

Try Schedule+ again, this time you are asked if you would like to work in Group
Mode or alone.
