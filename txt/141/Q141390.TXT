TITLE   :FIX: NOCONSOLE in Report Form Command Causes Erratic Behavior
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:3.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You experience erratic behavior when you use the NOCONSOLE parameter in the
REPORT FORM command.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in FoxPro 3.0b for
Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

Create and run the following program:

      REPORT FORM C:\vfp\samples\mainsamp\reports\listcat ;
                PREVIEW NOWAIT NOCONSOLE
      REPORT FORM C:\vfp\samples\mainsamp\reports\listcust ;
                PREVIEW NOWAIT NOCONSOLE

The NOCONSOLE clause prevents the NOWAIT clause from working. The next report
does not show up until the first report window is closed.

The NOCONSOLE clause in conjunction with the PREVIEW clause (with or without the
NOWAIT clause) causes the preview window's control menu to be dimmed although
you can still click an option and have it work.
