SUMMARY
=======

The Visual FoxPro Help file states that the SYS(1270) function returns a
reference for an object at the specified point, but it does not give an example
of how to use it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The return type for the SYS(1270) function is either an Object or Logical.
Because it could return an Object, you may receive a Data Type Mismatch error if
you type the following a in the Command window:

   ? SYS(1270)

If you don't include any coordinates when you issue a SYS(1270), it will use the
Mouse Pointer for the coordinates. The SYS(1270) function always returns a
Logical False if no object is under the mouse pointer or located at the
coordinates specified.

The following example uses a timer to call the SYS(1270) function and then
increment a counter any time the mouse pointer isn't over the FoxPro Screen
Object. (The Screen Object is the main Visual FoxPro Window. For more
information search for _Screen in the Help file.)

**************** Begin Code ******************* PUBLIC oMyScreen

oMyScreen = CREATEOBJECT('Form') oMyScreen.AddObject('Text1','TextBox')
oMyScreen.Text1.Top = 5 oMyScreen.Text1.Left = 5 oMyScreen.Text1.value = 1
oMyScreen.Text1.Visible = .T. oMyScreen.AddObject('Timer1','MyTimer')
oMyScreen.Show

DEFINE CLASS MyTimer AS Timer

   Interval = 1000  && Calls the Timer event every second.
   PROCEDURE Timer Event

   x=sys(1270) DO CASE CASE TYPE('x')='O' IF x.name != 'Screen' ** Increments
   the value by 1 if your mouse is over ** an Object that is not the FoxPro
   Desktop Thisform.Text1.Value = Thisform.Text1.Value + 1 ENDIF CASE TYPE('x')
   = 'L' ** Increments the value by 1 if your mouse is not over ** an Object
   Thisform.Text1.Value = Thisform.Text1.Value + 1 ENDCASE

   ENDPROC
