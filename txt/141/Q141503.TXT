   CREATE DATA mydata
   MODIFY DATA mydata

2. Right-click the Database Designer, and choose New Remote View. In the

   data sources.

   double-clicking it. Alternatively, you can select the file and click OK. Note
   that the Next button is disabled. After selecting the workbook, you will get
   the error message. Click OK to return to step 1.
