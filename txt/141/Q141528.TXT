PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Validation Text properties button in the Database Designer has a limitation.
When the text box is filled with the maximum of 253 characters, Visual FoxPro
will shut down. If the operating system is Windows for Workgroups, it will shut
down immediately, and if the operating system is Windows 95, you'll first
receive an Invalid Page Fault error message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Open a database (.dbc file) by using the MODIFY DATABASE command.

2. Click any table to select it. Then right-click, and choose Modify.

3. In the text box next to Validation text, enclose in as many characters in
   quotation marks as it will allow (253 characters).

4. Click OK. In Windows 95, an Invalid Page Fault will occur. In Windows for
   Workgroups, Visual FoxPro quits and sends you directly to the operating
   system without an error.
