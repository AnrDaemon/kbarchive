SYMPTOMS
========

If a copy of an executable is running on your computer, and you try to create a
new executable with the same filename, the following error message appears:

   Permission Denied "Project.exe"

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused by the fact that a copy of the project's executable file is
already running on the system. Microsoft Windows does not allow a file to be
written to or deleted when it is running.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, either rename the .Exe file when you create a new
executable, or exit from the executable that is currently running.
