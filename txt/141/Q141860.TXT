KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbdta kbconversion

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Japanese PowerPoint for Japanese Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft Japanese PowerPoint for Japanese Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Chinese PowerPoint for Chinese Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft Chinese PowerPoint for Chinese Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Korean PowerPoint for Korean Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open a presentation created in a Chinese, Japanese, or
Korean (Far East) version of PowerPoint, you may receive one of the following
messages:

   Sorry, the file cannot be opened with this version of PowerPoint.

   -or-

   Sorry, this type of file cannot be opened by PowerPoint.

This error occurs when you are using a non-Far East version of PowerPoint 4.0 or
7.0 to open a presentation created and saved in Far East PowerPoint format.

CAUSE
=====

The Far East languages use a different character set than non-Far East
languages. Because Far East languages have many, many characters, Far East
PowerPoint files must be stored in a double-byte format. The non-Far East
versions of PowerPoint save their files in a single-byte format.

The non-Far East versions of PowerPoint 7.0 can open the double-byte format, but
the non-Far East versions of PowerPoint 4.0 cannot.

RESOLUTION
==========

To open a Far East PowerPoint version 4.0 presentation in non-Far East versions
of PowerPoint listed at the beginning of this article, you must first save the
Far East presentation as a non-Far East PowerPoint version 4.0 file.

Non-Far East PowerPoint version 7.0 can open a file saved in Far East PowerPoint
version 4.0 or 7.0 format; however, you cannot read most of the content.
