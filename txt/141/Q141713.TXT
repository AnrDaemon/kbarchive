TITLE   :Mkecr5xx.sys Reports Wrong I/O in Registry for SoundBlaster 16
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience problems reading compact discs with a CD-ROM drive connected
directly to a SoundBlaster adapter if you are using Mkecr5xx.sys with the
default base I/O address listed in the documentation for the adapter.

CAUSE
=====

The base I/O address used by the SoundBlaster adapter is 10 higher than stated
in the documentation for these adapters. The base I/O address can be verified by
checking WinMSD or the Windows NT Registry.

RESOLUTION
==========

Reset the base I/O address to a different setting that no other device is using.
The address should be chosen so that it is free for 20 address spaces (for
example, 0x320-0x33F).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
