SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Sigma Designs' ReelMagic (also called RealMagic) drivers, the
system startup sound is played repeatedly when you restart your computer. If you
open the Sounds tool in Control Panel and play a wave (.wav) file, the sound is
played repeatedly.

CAUSE
=====

Sigma Designs' software looks for an "Int=" line in the [Sound] section of the
Fmpdrv.ini file in the folder in which you installed the ReelMagic software. If
this line is not present, the software defaults the audio IRQ setting to 5,
instead of using the IRQ setting you may have specified. Note that the
"Interrupt=" line in the Fmpdrv.ini file is not used to set the interrupt.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to edit the Fmpdrv.ini file and add the
line

   Int=<x>

to the [Sound] section of the file, where <x> is an available interrupt,
and then restart your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================
