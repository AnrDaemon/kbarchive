SUMMARY
=======

The Setup Wizard in Visual Basic version 4.0 creates SETUP1.EXE that when
executed displays a blue background with white letters that say, "<EXE
NAME> Setup," where <EXE NAME> is the name of your application. This
article explains how to change that message to something other than the default.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To change the display of <EXE NAME>, follow these steps:

1. Run the Setup Wizard as you normally would to create installation disks.

2. Insert the first installation disk into drive A.

3. Run Notepad.

4. Open the file "SETUP.LST" from the disk.

5. Change the item "Title" in the "[Setup]" group as shown below:

         [Setup]
         Title=YourNewTitle

6. Save the file.

7. Close Notepad.

If you have saved your Setup Wizard installation you can make the modification
permanent the next time you build a set of installation disks. Follow these
steps:

1. Run Notepad.

2. Open the .VBZ file that pertains to your application.

3. Change the item "AppTitle" in the "[Flags]" group as shown below:

         [Flags]
         AppTitle=YourNewTitle

4. Save the file.

5. Close Notepad.

This will automatcally be added to you "SETUP.LST" file the next time you build
installation disks from the Setup Wizard.
