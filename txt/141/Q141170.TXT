TITLE   :PRB: DBGrid Has No Default Property
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:4.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to use the default property of the DBGrid control results in the
error:

   Run-time error '438':
   Object doesn't support this property or method

CAUSE
=====

Despite what the Programmer's Guide and the online help say, the DBGrid control
has no default property. The default value for the standard, data unaware,
Microsoft Grid control is Text. That property was erroneously listed in the
Programmer's Guide as the default property for the DBGrid control.

RESOLUTION
==========

Refer explicitly to any properties of the DBGrid control you want to use.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce
------------------

1. Start Visual Basic.

2. On the File menu, click New Project.

3. Double-click the DBGrid icon in the Toolbox to add a new data-bound grid to
   your project.

4. On the Run menu, click Start (ALT, R, S) or press F5. Press CTRL+BREAK, or
   press the PAUSE button to pause execution of the program. In the debug
   window, type the following

         Print DBGrid1

   and press ENTER. Visual Basic should output the value of the default property
   of the DBGrid control. However, since the DBGrid control has no default
   property, Visual Basic will give the error mentioned above.
