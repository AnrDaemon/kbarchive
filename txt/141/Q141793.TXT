TITLE   :PRB: Disk Size Reported By Compaq Differs from Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.10 3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install a Compaq computer, the number of bytes recognized by Disk
Administrator may be substantially different from what is reported by the Compaq
disk utility.

For example, on a Compaq Proliant 4500, SmartScsi Controller with four 2.1
gigabytes drives, the available disk space was reported by Compaq Smart Start as
having 8 gigabytes available. However when Windows NT 3.5 was installed, Disk
Administrator reported available disk space at 6 gigabytes.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs when the disk is improperly formatted during setup. If a Compaq
computer has not been previously formatted using the FORMAT FOR NT option, the
size of the disk reported by disk administrator may differ significantly.

Windows NT uses a different method of calculating the disk sectors available. For
more information about this, please see the following articles in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   ARTICLE-ID: Q111045
   TITLE : Boot Partition Size Limit with Compaq SmartSCSI Controller

   ARTICLE-ID: Q138064
   TITLE : Search Order for OLE Servers

RESOLUTION
==========

In order for Windows NT's Disk Administrator to see the correct number of
sectors, the disk must be formatted under Compaq's EISA config utility, under
advanced options, option #4, NT 3.5 MAX Partition.
