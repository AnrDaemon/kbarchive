======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Music Central for Windows, 1996, 1997 edition 
 - Microsoft Music Central for the Macintosh, 1996, 1997 editions 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you search for a name containing punctuation, such as commas, percentage
marks, or periods, the name is not found.

Cinemania 97
------------

On the index view, Cinemania 97 has the same problem if you enter something after
a punctuation mark. For example, if you enter, "20,", it will find "20,000 Eyes
(1961)". However, if you enter, "20,0", it will not find the same movie, or any
movie, for that matter. It is somewhat irregular, but worth mentioning that you
may want to just enter the first few digits when searching. Searching for,
"Blind Man's Zoo" gets you the correct song. Some of the "Search for a Word /
Phrase" portion of search does slightly better. Searching for numeric items with
punctuation yields worse results, whereas alpha characters with punctuation are
unaffected.

Music Central 97
----------------

This is the same as Cinemania 97; enter, "10," and you get to
10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 (Midnight Oil). If you enter "10,000", you do NOT get
10,000 maniacs. If you enter 10000, you still do not get it.

RESOLUTION
==========

Type the name without punctuation.

For example:

Music Central 1996 and 1997:

Group Name                        Text Entered
----------                        ------------

10,000 Maniacs                    "10000 maniacs"

Cinemania 1996 and 1997:

Movie                             Text Entered
-----                             ------------

20,000 Leagues under the sea    "20000 leagues under the sea"
