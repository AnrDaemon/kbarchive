SYMPTOMS
========

When you send mail using the Send To command from the desktop or Windows
Explorer using Microsoft Exchange, the attachment icon may be missing when the
mail is received by a Microsoft Mail client (including the Microsoft Mail client
in Microsoft Windows for Workgroups).

This situation can also occur if you send the attachment using the Compose New
Fax Wizard and you send no text with the attachment.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you send an attachment with the Send To command, place text before or after
the attachment.

-or-

If the message has already been received, click the Forward button for the
message in the Microsoft Mail client to cause the attachment title to appear.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that the attachment icon is still missing even if you place text before or
after the attachment or you click the Forward button for the message. The file
name for the attachment is displayed and you can outline the attachment, but the
icon does not appear. You can open the attachment by double-clicking the
outline, or you can save the attachment by clicking Save Attachment on the File
menu.
