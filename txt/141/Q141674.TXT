The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start Microsoft Schedule+, you may see the following error:

   Cannot access your server. Do you want to work offline?

NOTE: You can continue to use Schedule+, and a local calendar file (.CAL) file
will be created if one does not exist. However, you will not be able to access
your server calendar file, and the Open Other's Appt. Books... option will not
be available.

CAUSE
=====

This often happens with a new user account, and the SCHEDULE.KEY file is locked
open on the server by another process. If the file is locked open, the new users
cannot write their hexid number to the file.

NOTE: The SCHEDULE.KEY file contains pointers to each user's hexid
<nnnnnnnn>.CAL file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To check for and release a file lock, do the following based on the Network
Operating System (NOS):

Microsoft Windows NT:

1. Open File Manager.

2. From the File menu, choose Properties. Then select Open by... This will tell
   you what user or process has the file locked open.

3. Stop the process or have the user log off to eliminate the lock on the file.

Novell NetWare:

1. Run the Monitor NLM at the server or RCONSOLE at a remote workstation.

2. Select File Open/Lock Activity from the Available Options.

3. Remove the lock from the file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The above error may also be caused by networking issues. For additional
