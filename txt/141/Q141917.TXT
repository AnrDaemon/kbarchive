PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use an Outline Control, the WAIT WINDOW will not deactivate when a
navigation key is pressed (keyboard or mouse).

WORKAROUND
==========

Click outside the outline control to deactivate WAIT WINDOW or select a key
other than keys used to navigate in the outline control (arrow keys, PGUP, or
PGDN).

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form, and drop an OLE Container Control onto the form. Select
   Insert Control for the OLE Container and Outline Control for the Control
   Type.

2. Add Vfp\Samples\Data\Customer.dbf to the Data Environment, and set the Order
   property of the Customer cursor to CONTACT.

3. In the form's Init event, place this code:

      ****** Begin INIT ******

      SELECT Customer
      GO TOP
      FOR lnI=1 to RECCOUNT()
        THISFORM.OLECONTROL1.ADDITEM(contact,lnI)
        THISFORM.OLECONTROL1.INDENT(lnI)=1
        SKIP
      ENDFOR
      THISFORM.REFRESH

      ******* End INIT *******

4. Inside the Outline control's DBLCLICK event, type:

      WAIT WINDOW

5. Run the form. Double-click any item inside the outline control. The Wait
   Window will not deactivate. You can move up and down the outline control list
   by using either the keyboard or mouse controls and the Wait window will still
   be active. You must select outside the outline control to deactivate the WAIT
   WINDOW.
