TITLE   :PRB: "Error #101 in addgraphdata(0)" in Query Designer
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0b,5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbvfp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With a laptop installation of Visual FoxPro for Windows, when you try to output
the results of a query to a graph, the following error message is returned:

   Error #101 in addgraphdata(0): cannot open file fxole30b.dll

CAUSE
=====

A laptop installation of Visual FoxPro for Windows does not install the
Fxole30b.dll file.

WORKAROUND
==========

A complete installation works correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A complete installation of a previous version of Visual FoxPro will install
Microsoft Graph. An upgrade of just the laptop version of Visual FoxPro will
leave the Microsoft Graph files there but will not install the Fxole30b.dll
file. This allows the Graph button under the Output Settings to be enabled, but
when you click the button, an error occurs. A complete installation of Visual
FoxPro installs Fxole30b.dll, so no error is generated.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a query.

2. Choose Graph under the Output Settings.

3. Run Query, and follow steps in Graph Wizard.

4. Click Finish, and the error message appears.
