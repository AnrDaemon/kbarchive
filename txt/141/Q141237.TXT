TITLE   :Site Configuration Manager Does Not Start After System Reboot
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbSCMan smssiteconfigman

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you shutdown and restart Systems Management Server, Site Configuration
Manager service does not start.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if your computer does the following:

 - Slow disk and memory throughout

 - Constant paging to disk as Windows NT and Systems Management Server services
   are loading

 - Many applications are starting during startup

Site Configuration Manager may time out due to the above configuration.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Start applications manually. Do not start applications during Windows NT
   startup.

2. Reduce the number of Windows NT Server services to start automatically. You
   may start the default Windows NT Server services automatically.

3. Increase disk and memory throughput. This may require hardware upgrades such
   as hard disk and controller with faster data transfer rate, and additional
   memory.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
