======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you change the order of the displayed icons in the Contents pane in Windows
Explorer before you finish renaming a file, the wrong file may be renamed.

CAUSE
=====

Windows Explorer renames files based on their position in the list of displayed
files. If you begin the process of renaming a file, change the order of the
displayed icons, and then finish renaming the file, the wrong file may be
renamed.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you have not performed any other action since renaming the file, click Undo
Rename on the Edit menu to restore the original file name. If you have already
performed another action, the Undo Rename command is not available and you must
manually rename the file to its original name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
