The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1

SUMMARY
=======

When a writable CD-ROM drive is attached to a system running Windows NT, the
device may not be recognized. This holds true not only for the ability to write
to the device, but reading from it may also not be possible.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A writable CD-ROM device can present itself to the SCSI adapter in one of 2
ways:

The device may present itself as a WORM (Write Once Read Many) device. Many
writable CD-ROM devices uses this means of identification to the SCSI host
adapter. Unfortunately, since Windows NT does not support WORM devices, this
means of identification prevents Windows NT from being able to access the
device.

More recently, writable CD-ROM devices have become available that present
themselves to the SCSI host adapter as a standard CD-ROM device. Such units are
likely to be compatible with Windows NT. Although compatibility of every such
device cannot be guaranteed, this manner of identification to the SCSI adapter
is one prerequisite that a writable CD-ROM device must meet. Assuming that the
device then behaves as does a standard CD-ROM drive, Windows NT should be able
to read from the CD-ROM drive as it would from any ordinary CD-ROM drive.

In order to write to the CD-ROM drive in the Windows NT environment, a CD-ROM
mastering package compatible with Windows NT should be obtained.
