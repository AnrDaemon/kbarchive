PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Attachmate's Extra! for Windows uses an MS-DOS TSR to interface with DLC. This
works fine on Windows for Workgroups, but not in Windows NT DOS/WOW. When
DLC.CLOSE.STATION is called, a 32-bit pointer is returned instead of a 16-bit
pointer. This pointer may point to code in KRNL386.EXE and causes a memory
access violation.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been corrected in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
