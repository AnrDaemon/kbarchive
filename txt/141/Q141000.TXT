1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Display.

3. Click the Settings tab, note the Desktop Area or Screen Area setting, and
   then move the Desktop Area or Screen Area slider all the way to the left (the
   640 x 480 setting).

4. Click OK, and then follow the instructions on the screen to keep the new
   display resolution setting.

5. Close Control Panel.

6. Start the Multimedia program.

7. Click Options, and then click the Run Full Screen check box to clear it.

8. Close the Multimedia program.

9. Repeat steps 1-4 to change the display resolution back to the original
   setting you noted in step 3.
