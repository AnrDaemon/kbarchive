The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

Below is the README from the updated Hewlett-Packard (HP) PCL5EMS drivers. At
the end of the document are locations for downloading the driver set.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PCL5EMS.DLL Version 3.30
------------------------

This release adds support for the following HP Model Printers:

 - HP LaserJet 5Si

 - HP LaserJet 5Si MX

 - HP LaserJet 5L

 - HP CopyJet

 - HP DeskJet 1600C

Requirements Before Installation
--------------------------------

These updated Drivers require that Service Pack 3 be installed before they will
work properly. In particular WINSRV.DLL was changed to handle large spool files
across the Lan.

The order of Installation is important. Please install in the following order:

1. Service Pack 3

2. Updated Printer Drivers.

In the event that you installed the Service Pack 3 last please do the following:

1. Select the Installed Printer from Print Manager

2. From the Printer Menu choose "Remove Printer"

3. Following the Installation steps listed in the section "Installation
   Instructions"

Known Issues:

In some cases, when printing to the HP Deskjet 1600c in 24bit color mode from 16
bit applications, the output received may not be in color. This does not occur
when printing in 8 bit (256 color) mode or the 3 bit (8 color) mode. This
problem can be worked around by printing to a lower color mode setting or, if
possible, printing from a 32 bit version of the application.
