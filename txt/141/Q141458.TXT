You cannot select a large amount of text in the disassembly window.

For example, start debugging an application and break at some location in the
program. View the source in the disassembly window. Start selecting text in the
window. The selection gets reset when it includes approximately 120 lines. If
the selection involves scrolling up, then the selection is reset after every
line.

STATUS
======

beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++ .NET.
