 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51

You can synch the password on the Netware server with the password on the
FPNW server by making sure that the password on the Netware server is the
same as the password on the FPNW before you run Setpass.exe or Chgpass.exe
from \Sysvol\Public on the FPNW server. If the passwords are not identical,
the FPNW will not ask you to synch the password on the Netware server and
as a result, the password on the Netware server is still the same.
