TITLE   :PRB: Changing _ASCIIROWS Modifies a Report
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you increase the value of the _ASCIIROWS system variable, the output of a
report to the text file does not look the way you might expect. There are more
blank lines in the report. It does not seem that more information is printed on
one page if the value of _ASCIIROWS is changed from 63 to 120, but there are
more blank lines.

CAUSE
=====

The value of _ASCIIROWS does not control the number of records that appear on
one page. This number is the same regardless of the output selected for the
report; it does not change when going from a graphical report to an ASCII
report. _ASCIIROWS defines the number of ASCII lines that the graphical report
is printed to. If the graphical report defines a page with less lines than the
ASCII result, blank lines are inserted between detail lines, and the report
looks double- or triple-spaced.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can combine increasing _ASCIIROWS with reducing the size of the Detail band
to increase the number of lines on one page. You can do this by using smaller
font sizes and collapsing the Detail band.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
