TITLE   :PRB: Setup Wizard Fails to Create Distribution Directory
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Visual FoxPro is installed on a shared Windows network running Novell
Netware 3.12 with a local workstation installation, the Setup Wizard fails if
the user selects the "create directory" option.

CAUSE
=====

Visual FoxPro was installed as a shared network installation and by design, the
workstation installation does not include the "Professional Features" option.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "Professional Features" option and associated programs of the "Application
Distribution" option, were not intended to be run on a shared network
environment. The Setup Wizard will function correctly with a local copy of
Windows 3.1, Windows for Worgroups, Windows NT, or Windows 95 and a local
installation of Visual FoxPro.

Additional query words: VFoxWin distrib workstation network
