TITLE   :PRB: APPEND BLANK on a Child Grid Does Not Display New Record
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:3.00 5.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp300 kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In a one-to-many form, when you want your form to have the ability to add child
records into the grid, you find that clicking the grid does not allow you to
scroll beyond the last record. Adding a button that uses APPEND BLANK to add a
new child record won't add a record to the grid.

CAUSE
=====

In a one-to-many form the grid only displays related records -- records that
have a key identical to the key of the parent. When you issue an APPEND BLANK
command, the key field in the new record is blank and is therefore not displayed
in the grid.

RESOLUTION
==========

After issuing an APPEND BLANK command, use REPLACE to write a value to the key
field. You can also use the INSERT command with the VALUES clause instead of
APPEND BLANK. For example, remove the asterisk from the code in step 4 below, or
use the command button in Step 5 to resolve the problem.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the following steps to create a one-to-many form with a command button that
calls APPEND BLANK and a command button that calls INSERT.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form.

2. In the Data Environment of the form add \Vfp\Samples\Data\Orders.dbf. Then
   add the table \Vfp\Samples\Data\Orditems.dbf

3. Drag some fields from the Orders table in the data environment onto the form.
   Click the title bar of the Orditems table in the data environment, and drag
   it onto the form to create a grid.

4. Add a command button to the form, and set its Caption property to Append. Add
   the following code to the Click event of the button:

      SELECT Orditems
      APPEND BLANK
      * REPLACE order_id WITH Orders.order_id
      SELECT Orders
      THISFORM.Refresh

5. Add another command button to the form, and set its Caption property to
   Insert. Add the following code to the Click event of the button

      INSERT INTO orditems (order_id) VALUES (Orders.order_id)
      THISFORM.Refresh

6. Add a final command button to the form, and set its Caption property to Exit.
   Add the following code to the Click event of the button:

      RELEASE THISFORM

7. Click the View Classes button on the form control toolbar. Select Add from
   the menu. In Visual FoxPro 5.0, double-click the file in
   \Vfp\Samples\Classes\Buttons.vcx. Or in Visual FoxPro 3.0, double-click the
   file in \Vfp\Samples\Controls\Buttons.vcx. Select the VCR control, and drop
   it onto the form.

8. Run the form, and click the Append button.
