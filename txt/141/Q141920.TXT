SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a fax using Microsoft Exchange, your fax may be returned
immediately as undeliverable. When you open the message, you see the following
explanation:

   The recipient's e-mail address is incorrect or does not exist. Be
   sure to type the address correctly, and try sending the message
   again. If the message cannot be sent, contact your administrator.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the fax client is behind the mail client in the
delivery order.


RESOLUTION
==========

Change the delivery order to place the fax client ahead of the mail client. To
do so, follow these steps:

1. Use the right mouse button to click the Inbox icon on the desktop, and then
   click Properties on the menu that appears.

2. Click the Delivery tab.

3. Click Microsoft Fax Transport, and then move it above Microsoft Mail using
   the arrows to the right of the box.
