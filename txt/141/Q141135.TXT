PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The MS Mail Connector Interchange (MSMI) logs a failure to process a Non-
Delivery Report (NDR) from Microsoft Exchange in the Windows NT event log when
it tries to send the NDR to an MS Mail user.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The NDR is coming back from an adjacent 1984 X.400 MTA and Microsoft Exchange is
acting as a messaging switch between MS Mail and the 1984 X.400 system. The NDR
is passed from Microsoft Exchange with an unknown content, therefore, the MSMI
cannot deliver the NDR to the MS Mail user.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack 2. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
