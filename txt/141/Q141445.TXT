======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This is the 32-bit version of this sample.

The Dlgdb32 code sample demonstrates how to have a CDialog derived class share a
CRecordset object that a CRecordView is already using. In addition, when used by
itself, the code sample also demonstrates how to select CRecordset object from a
CDocument without having a CRecordView.

NOTE: This sample assumes that ODBC has been installed and that the Student
Registration data source has been configured.
