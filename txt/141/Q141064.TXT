-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are on a network which operating system has the functionality of
adjusting for changes in daylight savings time, there will be a problem if you
also use the Automatically Adjust Clock for Daylight Savings Time Changes
feature in Microsoft Windows 95, particularly if all workstations on the network
are either not using Windows 95 or have disabled this feature in Control Panel,
Date/Time, Time Zone tab.

If you allow the network operating system as well as Windows 95 to adjust for
these changes, then you are no longer synchronized with the rest of the network
and entries made into other users' schedules will be changed to try to adjust
for this.

The following is an example of a Schedule+ problem that has been encountered:

Use Schedule+ to schedule meetings on a Novell network, running Windows 95 and
Office 95. The other workstations are running Windows for Workgroups. The
network operating system had adjusted all clocks on the system when there was a
change between daylight saving time and eastern standard time. When the Windows
95 user was asked if he or she wanted to have Windows 95 automatically adjust
for changing the clocks, the user chooses Yes. After this, all other schedules
on the network that had meetings scheduled, prior to the time change, for 1:00
P.M. found that the time has now been changed to 2:00 P.M.

CAUSE
=====

If the network operating system adjusts the time and then Windows 95 adjusts the
time. The Windows 95 machine is no longer synchronized with the other machines
on the network. It has actually had its time set back by one hour twice. The
workstation appears to be in a different time zone than the rest of the
machines. In an effort to synchronize the times, the scheduled appointment times
change.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, choose Date/Time from the Control Panel. In the Time Zone
tab, disable Automatically adjust clock for daylight savings time changes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you click the question mark (?) on Automatically adjust clock for daylight
savings time changes, you get an explanation of the feature as well as the
following warning:

   If you use more than on operating system, make sure that only one of then
   adjusts for daylight saving time.
