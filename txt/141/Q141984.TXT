SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the location of Microsoft Exchange, version 4.0, client
User Profiles.

MORE INFORMATION
================


When using the Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 95, the user profiles are
saved in the Registry under the following key:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\WINDOWS MESSAGING SUBSYSTEM\PROFILES


NOTE: The Microsoft Exchange user profiles contain binary information and should
not be modified in the registry. Editing the profiles this way can cause
irreparable damage to the profile. It will then have to be deleted and
recreated, resulting in the loss of all settings.


Additional query words: user profiles
