SYMPTOMS
========

When you draw ovals in the Painting Studio, there may be lines and/or ovals that
appear to the left of the finished oval. It is actually a small oval or an oval
on its edge, which makes it appear as a line on the screen.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, erase the objects using the vacuum tool.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Fine Artist for Windows, versions
1.0, 1.1, and 1.1a. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
