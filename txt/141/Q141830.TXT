TITLE   :NT Backup Cannot Back Up Microsoft Exchange Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1 3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows NT server acting as a centralized backup server is unable to back up a
Microsoft Exchange mail server in the Microsoft Exchange mail database
(Information Store and Directory) format if the server is not a Microsoft
Exchange mail server. This occurs using either the current Windows NT backup
utility or Arcada's NTBackup software.

CAUSE
=====

A Windows NT Server that is not running as a Microsoft Exchange mail server does
not have the three required DLL files that are new in Microsoft Exchange Mail
Server and the current NTBackup.exe cannot use these new DLLs.

Currently, NT Backup has no capability to distinguish a Microsoft Exchange mail
server from other computers and so cannot back up a Microsoft Exchange mail
server's files in the Microsoft Exchange Mail Server Database (Information Store
and Directory) format.

RESOLUTION
==========

To allow NT Backup to recognize and back up Microsoft Exchange mail servers,
close any opened backup window and do one of the following:

 - If you are copying files from an existing Exchange RC1 Mail Server:

   1. Rename or delete the current WINNT-WINNT-ROOT\SYSTEM32\NTBACKUP.EXE from
      the NT Backup Server.

   2. Copy Winnt-Winnt-Root\System32\NTBackup.exe, Edbbcli.dll, and Msvcrt40.dll
      from a Microsoft Exchange mail server to the Winnt- Root\System32
      subdirectory of the Windows NT backup server.

   3. Copy Exchsrvr\Bin\Edbback.dll from the Microsoft Exchange mail server to
      the Winnt-Root\System32 subdirectory of the Windows NT backup server.

-or-

 - If you are copying files from Exchange RC1 Mail Server CD-ROM:

   1. Rename or delete the current Winnt-Winnt-Root\System32\NTBackup.exe of the
      Windows NT backup Server.

   2. Copy NTBackup.exe, Edbbcli.dll, Edbback.dll and Msvcrt40.dll files in
      Setup\I386 (or MIPS or Alpha) on the Exchange Mail Server CD-ROM to the
      Winnt-Root\System32 subdirectory of the Windows NT backup server.
