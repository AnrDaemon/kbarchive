SUMMARY
=======

There are several search services on the Internet that allow you to enter
keywords, such as a company or product name, and receive a list of sites that
contain information on those keywords. This article provides the addresses of
two of the most popular sites.

To search for a company site, enter the complete name of the company on the query
line; if you fail to use the complete company name, you may receive unexpected
results. For example, if you query on the word "apple," the query returns hits
not only on Apple Computer, but also any hits on sites concerned with growing,
selling, or cooking with apples.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Lycos can be accessed at http://www.lycos.com/reference/faq.html. Lycos
considers the Internet a massive catalog of information, data, and documents.
They provide a catalog for this wealth of information and a means to search the
catalog. The Lycos FAQ page (at the http address above) provides a complete
introduction to the services and history of Lycos in the form of an FAQ.

The Lycos Home Page provides a query line, several Search options, and several
Display options, all of which you can choose from a list box. To query the Lycos
catalog, enter your query terms or keywords on the query line, and then click
Search. The /reference/search-help.html page provides instructions on how to use
the search features.

When your search is complete, Lycos displays the results of the search by number
of URLs containing your search terms, the number of documents containing your
search terms, and a relevancy ranking with the most relevant listings at the top
of the list.

There are also News, Hot Lists, Point Reviews, and Help jumps, each containing
current information on the subject category. Lycos claims to index over 90% of
the World Wide Web, and it includes FTP and Gopher sites.

YAHOO, or Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle, is one of the most popular
Web search sites and can be accessed at http://www.yahoo.com.

On the YAHOO Home Page you find a hierarchical listing of categories by subject,
a query line, and a Search button. To query on all listings, enter your search
terms on the query line and click the search button. To query in one subject
category only, click the category title and jump to the category page; then, use
the query line on that page. Near the Search button is the Options jump-text. If
you jump to this page, you can compose Boolean searches using AND and OR
operators.

When your search is complete, YAHOO displays the results of the search, organized
by category. Appended at the bottom of each search is an Other Search Engines
list that includes Lycos, Web Crawler, Inforseek, and DejaNews. Clicking on one
of these names takes you to that search service; these services are smaller, or
index a limited range of topics.
