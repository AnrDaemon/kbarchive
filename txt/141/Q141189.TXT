TITLE   :BUG: Wrong Error Code on NetBIOS Call When Using NWNBLNK
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbAPI kbNetBIOS kbSDKPlatform kbGrpDSNet

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using an application that communicates using NetBIOS and uses
NWLink as a protocol, the application may report incorrect error messages. The
errors indicate that the server application is not running although you can
confirm the server is running.

CAUSE
=====

When a client application uses NCBCALL to connect to a remote server application
there are several possible error conditions. One is when the server application
does not currently accept new connections (error code NRC_REMTFUL, 0x12) and
another error is when the application name the client looks for is not
registered on the remote computer (error code NRC_NOCALL, 0x14).

NWLink returns NRC_NOCALL for both cases so the client assumes the remote
computer does not have the server application running, whereas NRC_REMTFUL
indicates that a new connection attempt can be made later.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in the latest
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
