   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to add directory descriptions to inform FTP users of
the contents of directories on the server.

To annotate files, do the following:

1. Create a file called ~ftpsvc~.ckm in the directory where you want to annotate
   with the information to be displayed to the user.

2. In Windows NT File Manager, select the file and make it a hidden file so that
   directory listings do not display this file.

NOTE: This only works with the command line FTP on one line. If you are using
Microsoft Internet Explorer for FTP, and using directory annotation, Internet
Explorer will give you the following error message:

   Internet explorer could not open site address

Netscape browser does not give an error; however, it still does not work. This is
a client or browser problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Directory annotation can be toggled by FTP users on a user-by-user basis with a
built-in, site-specific command called ckm. This varies depending on the FTP
client used. For a Microsoft FTP client, the command "literal SITE CKM" toggles
annotations for the FTP client on or off.

To change the FTP Server service configuration in the registry, do the
following:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:
   SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\msftpsvc\Parameters

3. Add the entry: AnnotateDirectories Data type = REG_DWORD Range = 0 or 1
   (default = 0) 0, false - directory annotation is off 1, true - directory
   annotation is on The value, AnnotateDirectories, does not appear by default
   in the registry, so you must add an entry if you want to change its default
   value.

4. Set this value is 1 to enable directory annotation.

5. Choose OK and quit Registry Editor.

6. Shut down and restart Windows NT.
