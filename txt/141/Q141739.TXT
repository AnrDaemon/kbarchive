TITLE   :BUG: Sendmail.scx Hangs FoxPro If Mail Client Not Installed
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Sendmail.scx example runs under Windows 95 on a computer that does not
have Microsoft Exchange installed, Visual FoxPro hangs (stops responding). Also,
placing the Mapibtn.vcx class library on a form and running the form causes the
same behavior.

CAUSE
=====

The Mailbtn.vcx class library does not check for the installation of Microsoft
Exchange or a mail client. Also, the MapiSession control should not hang if the
SignOn method executes and no mail clients are installed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

WARNING: Close all running applications and save your data before following this
procedure. To close all open applications, press CTRL+ALT+DEL to open the
Windows Task List, and then close all the other applications you have running.
Note that following these steps may produce lost allocation units, lost
clusters, or cross-linked files.

On a computer running Windows 95 without any mail clients installed, type the
following in the Command window:

      SET DEFAULT TO SYS(2004)+"Samples\Ole"
      DO FORM Sendmail.scx

On a computer running Windows 95 without a mail client installed, an hour glass
appears and remains indefinitely. Press CTRL+ALT+DEL to invoke the Close Program
window, select Microsoft Visual FoxPro, and click End Task.
