TITLE   :PRB: AutoOpenTables/AutoCloseTables Ignored in Program
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When creating a form visually, you discover that the data environment's
AutoOpenTables property is set to True (.T.) by default and the tables and views
will automatically be opened when the form is run. If the data environment is
instantiated from within a program, the value of AutoOpenTables and
AutoCloseTables is ignored.

WORKAROUND
==========

Call the OPENTABLES or CLOSETABLES methods directly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new program file, and type the following code:

      ******* Begin Program **********

      public oData1
      oData1=CREATEOBJECT("MyData")  && Instaniate the Data Environment

      DEFINE CLASS MyData AS dataenvironment   && DataEnvironment Class
      Name = "Dataenvironment"
      AutoOpenTables=.T.
      AutoCloseTables=.T.
      ADD OBJECT "Cursor1" AS MyCursor     && ADD OBJECT for each
      ENDDEFINE                            && cursor in Dataenvironment

      DEFINE CLASS MyCursor AS cursor      && Cursor Class
      Alias = "author"
      Database = "C:\vfp\samples\data\testdata.dbc"
      CursorSource = "customer"
      Name = "Cursor1"
      ENDDEFINE

      ******* End Program *******

2. Run the program.

3. Check the View window. You will see that no tables are opened. The Data
   Environment's AutoOpenTables is ignored.

4. In the Command window type:

   " oData1.OpenTables " (without the quotation marks)

   NOTE: If the Testdata.dbc is not in your Path, you need to locate it.

5. Note that the table is opened.

6. Inside the Command window, type:

   " oData1.CloseTables " (without the quotation marks)

7. The OpenTables/CloseTables must be called directly because AutoOpenTables and
   AutoCloseTables are ignored.
