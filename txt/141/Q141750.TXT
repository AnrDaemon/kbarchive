The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows 1995 edition 
 - Microsoft Bookshelf 1996-97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you copy an article containing both text and a picture from Bookshelf 1995
or Bookshelf '96-'97 (16-bit), you are unable to paste the entire article into
Lotus AmiPro. Either the article text or the picture does not appear.

If you are using an early version of AmiPro, the program may stop responding
(hang).

WORKAROUND
==========

Copy and paste the article text and picture separately from Bookshelf.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you copy the article text, you must click Paste Special and select
Unformatted Text to paste the text into Ami Pro.

After you copy the picture, select either Device Independent Bitmap (.dib) or
Windows Bitmap (.bmp) to paste the picture into Ami Pro.

For more information about how to accomplish these tasks in Ami Pro, see your Ami
Pro user's guide.
