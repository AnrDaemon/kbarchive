SUMMARY
=======

An object property accessed from an Add-In returns a Properties collection, not
the object specified by the property. This gives you the ability to access
individual properties of the object as Property objects. However, this means
that you cannot set the object property to a new object.

In the case of a Font property, each of the individual properties of the Font
object can be changed from an Add-In. However, in the case of a Picture
property, each of the individual properties of the Picture object cannot be
changed. Therefore, any object properties of type Picture cannot be set from an
Add-In. For a form, this includes the Icon, MouseIcon, and Picture properties.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is not possible to set a picture property from an Add-In as follows, where
objFT is a FormTemplate object and VBInstance is the Application object passed
to the Add-In:

      Set objFT = VBInstance.ActiveProject.ActiveForm
      Set objFT.Properties("Picture").Value = LoadPicture("MY.BMP")

The Value property in this case returns a Properties collection not a Picture
object. You can use this Properties collection to examine and modify the
properties of the object. The following code shows three different syntaxes for
accessing the individual properties of a FormTemplate Picture property:

      Print objFT.Properties("Picture").Value("Handle").Value
      Print objFT.Properties("Picture")("Width")
      Print objFT.Properties!Picture!Height

The Picture object has Type, Handle, hPal, Height, and Width properties. It is
not possible to set all of these properties because they are not all read/write
properties. Therefore, you cannot construct a picture object by simply setting
all of its properties, as you can a font object.
