-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The working day (the hours between Day Starts At and Day Ends At) is limited to
half-hour values, even though you can set the time to minute precision.

CAUSE
=====

This is by product design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Even though users are able to set field values at minute increments, the Day
Starts At and Day Ends At time will always round down to the closest half hour
when minutes have been entered.

For example, if you set the Day Starts At time between 9:01 A.M. and 9:29 A.M.,
it the start time will reset to 9:00 A.M. If you set the Day Starts At time
between 9:31 AM and 9:59 AM, it will reset the start time to 9:30 A.M. The same
applies to the Day Ends At setting.
