TITLE   :SNA Server Admin "Select Domain" Dialog Box Suspended
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Server Admin "Select Domain" dialog box suspends until a full list of
domains is shown. Anything you enter in the Domain field is not processed until
the browse list of domains is returned.

NOTE: The SNA Server Admin "Select Domain" dialog box allows an administrator to
enter the name of an SNA Server or SNA Server domain to be administered.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated SNA Server Admin (SNAADMIN.EXE) to include a Low Speed
Connection check box that can be used to enable/disable browsing in the Select
Domain dialog box. If this check box is unchecked, SNA Server Admin does not
return a browse list of available domains.


Microsoft has updated the following files to correct this problem:

 - <snaroot>\SYSTEM\SNAADMIN.EXE

 - <snaroot>\SNAFILES.INF

 - <snaroot>\SNASFD.DLL


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
