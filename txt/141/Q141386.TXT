TITLE   :Using Send Command in 16-Bit Program Starts Microsoft Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Send command in a 16-bit program, Microsoft Exchange may be
started instead of the 16-bit mail program installed on your computer.

CAUSE
=====

The Send command is a Simple MAPI function. All 16-bit programs use Mapi.dll for
Simple MAPI. When you install Microsoft Exchange, Setup installs the Windows 95
version of the Mapi.dll file. When a 16-bit program calls Mapi.dll, Mapi.dll
calls Microsoft Exchange.

RESOLUTION
==========

To use the Send command in a 16-bit program with the 16-bit mail program
installed on your computer, replace the Windows 95 version of the Mapi.dll file
with the 16-bit mail program's version. Note that reinstalling the 16-bit mail
program does not resolve the issue because the Windows 95 version of the
Mapi.dll file is newer and is not replaced.

To replace the Windows 95 version of the Mapi.dll file, follow these steps:

1. Rename the Mapi.dll file in the Windows\System folder to Mapi.w95.

   NOTE: The Windows 95 version of the Mapi.dll file is 431K in size with a date
   of 7/11/95.

2. Obtain a copy of the 16-bit mail program's version of the Mapi.dll file and
   copy it to the Windows\System folder.
