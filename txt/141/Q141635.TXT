KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Symptoms for version 3.0 are different from those for version 3.0b. In
Visual FoxPro 3.0, the ToolTipText message does not display at all if it
contains more than 50 characters. In Visual FoxPro 3.0b, however, the
ToolTipText message displays the first 50 characters of the ToolTipText.

CAUSE
=====

The ToolTipText message is limited to 50 characters in length.

WORKAROUND
==========

In both Visual FoxPro 3.0 and 3.0b, limit the length of the ToolTipText to fewer
than 50 characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a new form, and set the ShowTips property of the form to true.

2. Place a text box on the form.

3. In the ToolTipText property of the text box, type "fifty-one (51) letter As"
   (without the quotation marks).

4. Run the form, and move the mouse pointer over the text box. In version 3.0,
   no ToolTipText message appears. In version 3.0b, the message is truncated
   after the 50th character.

5. In version 3.0, modify the form, and remove one of the letters in the
   ToolTipText property. Run the form, and the ToolTipText message appears.
