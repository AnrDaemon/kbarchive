TITLE   :Performance Monitor Reports Wrong Percent of Free Disk Space
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Performance Monitor reports the percent of free disk space incorrectly when used
on a system with a different number of physical disks than the system where the
workspace was originally created.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Go to a machine with one physical disk.

2. Using Performance Monitor, create a workspace in the alert log.

3. Add the counter %freespace to that log and make it <20% for drive 'C',
   parent '0'.

4. Save the workspace.

5. Load the saved workspace in Performance Monitor on a system with two or more
   physical drives.

The % of disk space is reported as 0% instead of the correct value and the parent
physical disk is reported as '--' instead of '0'. Performance monitor continues
to generate event log entries at the specified interval reporting disk space at
0%.

CAUSE
=====

Performance monitor does not correctly translate workspace settings for disk
space between two machines with a different number of physical disks.

WORKAROUND
==========

Create the workspace on each machine that has a different number of physical
disks. Performance monitor will then report correct percent of free disk space
for that system.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
