TITLE   :BUG: 'Z' Function on @ GET Doesn't Suppress Display of Zero
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0b,5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you have a format function code of 'Z' defined for an @...GET text box on
your screen, the value of '0' (zero) is still displayed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following information is taken from the Help file on the FUNCTION clause for
the text box. The FUNCTION parameter:

   Specifies a function code or picture code that determines how the text box
   output is displayed or printed. You can include the FUNCTION clause, the
   PICTURE clause, or both to create an editing mask. These clauses contain
   special codes that control how the memory variable, array element, or field
   is displayed and edited.

The Z function code is supposed to display the memory variable or field name as
blank if its numeric value is 0. In Visual FoxPro, when the text box has focus,
the display of the zero is not suppressed. In FoxPro for Windows, no zero is
displayed.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

   CLEAR
   Dept=0
   @ 2,2 GET dept FUNCTION "@Z"          ;
                  SIZE 1.000, 18.000     ;
