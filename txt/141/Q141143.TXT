The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The command _SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM.NAME tells you the name of the active form. There
is another way to determine the currently active form and to determine which
form was active before the current form.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Create three forms (Form1, Form2, and Form3).

2. Open the debug window and type the following:

      _SCREEN.FORMS(1).NAME
      _SCREEN.FORMS(2).NAME
      _SCREEN.FORMS(3).NAME
      _SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM.NAME
      _SCREEN.FORMCOUNT

3. Inside the Command window, type the following:

      DO FORM FORM1
      DO FORM FORM2
      DO FORM FORM3

   Note the following from the debug window:

      _SCREEN.FORMS(1).NAME         FORM1
      _SCREEN.FORMS(2).NAME         FORM2
      _SCREEN.FORMS(3).NAME         FORM3
      _SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM.NAME       FORM3
      _SCREEN.FORMCOUNT             3

      Note that _SCREEN.FORMS(3)= _SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM

4. Select Form1, and note the following changes from the debug window:

      _SCREEN.FORMS(1).NAME         FORM2
      _SCREEN.FORMS(2).NAME         FORM3
      _SCREEN.FORMS(3).NAME         FORM1
      _SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM.NAME       FORM1
      _SCREEN.FORMCOUNT             3

Notes
-----

_SCREEN.FORMS(_SCREEN.FORMCOUNT) always references the active form object.

_SCREEN.FORMS(_SCREEN.FORMCOUNT).NAME references the name of the active form.

_SCREEN.FORMS(_SCREEN.FORMCOUNT).CAPTION references the caption of the active
form.

_SCREEN.FORMS(_SCREEN.FORMCOUNT -1) always references the previously active form
object.

_SCREEN.FORMS(_SCREEN.FORMCOUNT-1).NAME references the name of the previously
active form.

_SCREEN.FORMS(_SCREEN.FORMCOUNT -1).CAPTION references the caption of the
previously active form.
