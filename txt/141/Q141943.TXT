SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a graphic image or video clip into WordPad, the colors on the
screen may change briefly and then return to normal.

CAUSE
=====

The color change occurs because WordPad changes the color palette so that it can
display the colors in the graphic image or video clip. This behavior occurs only
with a color setting of 256 or fewer colors.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent the brief color change, increase the number of colors in the color
palette. To do so, change the Color Palette setting on the Settings tab in
Display properties to High Color (16-bit) or True Color (24-bit). These settings
produce 65,000 or 16.8 million colors, respectively. Before changing the Color
Palette setting, make sure your display adapter and monitor are capable of
displaying more than 256 colors.

To change the Color Palette setting, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Display.

2. Click the Settings tab.

3. In the Color Palette box, click the setting you want.

4. Click OK.

5. When you are prompted to restart your computer, do so.
