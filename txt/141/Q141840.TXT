TITLE   :Ml3xec16.exe Causes GP Fault in Microsoft Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Microsoft Exchange, you may receive the following error
message

   Ml3xec16.exe caused a General Protection Fault in <file name>

where <file name> may be User.exe, Kernel32.dll, or a .dll file.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur if a 16-bit .dll file that is being called from one of the
following files is damaged or is using an old, undocumented, extended MAPI call
that is not supported:

 - Msmail.ini

 - Msmail32.ini

 - Shared.ini

 - Shared32.ini

 - Exchng32.ini

RESOLUTION
==========

Rename the Msmail.ini, Msmail32.ini, Shared.ini, Shared32.ini, and Exchng32.ini
files to prevent the error from occurring. Then, rename the files one at a time
to their original names to determine which file is calling the .dll file. You
can determine which .dll file is causing the error by not loading any of the
.dll files and then adding them one by one until the error occurs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Shared.ini and Shared32.ini files are located on network shares and are
pointed to in the Msmail.ini and Msmail32.ini files. For example:

   sharedextensionsdir=\\uncname

If the Shared32.ini file exists in the same directory as the Shared.ini file,
only the Shared32.ini file is used.

The following .dll files are known to cause problems and are not loaded by
Microsoft Exchange:

   Attmail.dll
   Bcc.dll
   Confcore.dll
   Confplus.dll
   Cssmdel.dll
   Emptyw32.dll
   Emptywb.dll
   Faxopt.dll
   Impexp.dll
   Impexp32.dll
   Msrmt.dll
   Msrmtui.dll
   Pabchk.dll
   Pablist.dll
   Pabsync.dll
   Rename.dll
   Schedmsg.dll
   Schmsg32.dll
   Wgpomg32.dll
   Wgpomgr.dll
