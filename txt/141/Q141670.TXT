TITLE   :FIX: Profiling May Fail If Install Dir Contains Long File Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:4.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbide kbVC kbVC410fix kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The information in this article is included in the documentation starting
with Visual C++ 5.0. Look there for future revisions.

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have installed Visual C++ in a directory that has a long file name like
this one:

   C:\Microsoft Program Files\Development Platforms

you will get the following error message when you attempt to profile a project:

   VcSpawn is a utility program required by Visual C++ Development
   Environment.
   prep failed.

NOTE: This problem only occurs if the long file name contains spaces.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the problem, you can run the profiling tools from the command
line rather than through Developer Studio. Start a command prompt, and run the
Vcvars32.bat file in the Bin subdirectory of your Visual C++ installation. This
will ensure that the profiling tools directory is included in your PATH
environment variable. Now you can run one of the standard profiling batch files,
such as Fcount.bat, to profile your project. For more information on the
standard batch files, refer to Profiler Reference in the online documentation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ 4.1.
