TITLE   :Err Msg: No Such File or Directory Using FC.EXE
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Windows NT 3.51 file compare utility (FC.EXE) to compare two
identical files, the following error message appears:

   FC: cannot open C:\<file_name> - No such file or directory

This error occurs only if the first file has only the Compressed bit set. If any
of the other Attribute bits (Hidden, System, Read-only, or Archive) are set in
addition to the Compressed bit, the operation completes without an error.
Attribute bits set on the second file do not effect the compare operation.

CAUSE
=====

File compare does not support the compressed file attributes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A fix
to this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.
