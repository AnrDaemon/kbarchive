SYMPTOMS

After you change the Install Directory during the setup process, an error
similar to the following occurs.

   The instruction at "0x00415900" referenced memory at "0xa6375ebf".
   The memory could not be read.
   Click on OK to terminate the application.
   Click on CANCEL to debug the application.

On Windows 95:

   The program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

Pressing the details button reports:

   ~VCxxxx caused an invalid page fault in module ~VCxxxx.TMP at 0137: 00415900.

NOTE: "xxxx" represents a random number.

CAUSE
=====

The total length of the installation directory exceeded 248 characters.

STATUS
======

This bug was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++, version 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION

after which it is erased.
