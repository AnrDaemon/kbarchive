PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program to change the
alias of a recipient, the e-mail address associated with that mailbox is not
changed.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can create a new proxy address for the recipient in question, while keeping
the old address active.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The functionality to automatically change e-mail addresses is not available in
Microsoft Exchange Server. After an e-mail address has been assigned for a
particular recipient, it will remain until the Administrator explicitly changes
it.

Additional query words: aliasing
