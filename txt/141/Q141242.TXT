======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

In the Windows NT "Concepts and Planning Guide," Chapter 7, Page 17, titled
"Managing fault tolerance and UPS," the section, Testing Your Newly Created Boot
Disk, states:

   After creating your fault-tolerant boot floppy disk, you can perform the
   following simple test to reassure yourself that it will work when needed.

1. Insert the fault-tolerant boot floppy disk and restart the computer.

2. If your boot selection correctly specifies the alternate ARC path to the
   secondary mirrored partition, your system should begin to boot and then fail
   with the following STOP message:

   ***STOP: 0x0000006B (0xC000000D, 0x00000002, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)
   PROCESS1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED

MORE INFORMATION
================

You may experience a different stop message than the one listed above, but this
also indicates that the FT boot floppy is working correctly:

   *** STOP: 0x0000001E (0xc0000006,0x801Abe58,0x00000000, 0x00000000)
   KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED

To fully test the Fault-Tolerant Boot disk to ensure it will boot from your
mirrored drive, disable the primary NT drive by removing power to the drive.

Keep in mind that it will be necessary to change the rdisk(x) entry in the
Boot.ini file to compensate for the missing drive if the rdisk(x) value is
greater than (0) on the fault-tolerant disk.
