TITLE   :PRB: "Invalid argument" with dbAttachedTable or dbAttachedODBC

KEYWORDS:kbProgramming kbDAOsearch kbDatabase kbMFC kbVC

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), included with:
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When trying to pass dbAttachedTable or dbAttachedODBC as arguments to the
CDaoTableDef::Create() function or the CDaoTableDef::SetAttributes() function,
you will receive this DAO error:

   Error Code = 3001
   ....
   Description = Invalid argument.

CAUSE
=====

The Visual C++ documentation is incorrect. The values dbAttachedTable and
dbAttachedODBC cannot be passed as arguments. These attributes are read- only
attributes that are set internally by DAO based on the information provided in
the connect string of the table.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not try to set these attributes. DAO will set the attributes based on what is
contained in the connect string for the table. For example, look at this code:

      td.Create(_T("Table1"),0,_T("Table1"),
         _T("FoxPro 2.6;DATABASE=d:\\mydatabase\\"));

DAO will set the dbAttachedTable attribute flag for that table. A call to
CDaoTableDef::GetAttributes() will show the flag has been set.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
