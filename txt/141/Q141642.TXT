TITLE   :Mac Dangerous Creatures: No Help Window Opens; Computer Beeps
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Dangerous Creatures for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the Help menu to open a window, no window is displayed. All
subsequent attempts to open a window cause the computer to beep.

CAUSE
=====

Dangerous Creatures was designed to center certain windows on the main window.
This can be a problem when the main window is off the screen because the
centered windows are also off the screen.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do the following:

1. Press RETURN.

2. Move the window back to a normal on-screen position.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The window centered off the screen, along with the main window, contains an OK
button. You can't perform any function until the OK button clicked and the
Troubleshooting window closes.

When you press the RETURN key, the program interprets the action the same way it
would if you clicked. The Troubleshooting window closes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Dangerous Creatures version 1.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
