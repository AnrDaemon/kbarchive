SUMMARY
=======

The SNA Server Administration utility has been enhanced to allow you to specify
the domain or server you wish to administer using a command line parameter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A new command line parameter has been added to SNAADMIN.EXE to specify the
subdomain or server to administer. The /NET: parameter has the following
syntax:

   SNAADMIN /NET:<name>

where <name> is the name of a domain or server you wish to administer.

Admin uses this domain or server name to connect with instead of the local
domain. In previous versions, it was necessary to start SNA Server Admin at the
local domain and then specify a "remote" domain using the Select Domain option
from the File menu. No validation is done on the given name.

If admin fails to connect, then the appropriate error message box is eventually
shown. If the string "/NET:" is incorrectly typed, then the message
"Configuration file not found" is displayed. This same message is also displayed
for any other syntax error on the command line.

The /NET:<name> parameter cannot coexist with the /OFFLINE argument or the
filename parameter. In either of these cases, the /NET:<name> parameter is
ignored, and Admin is started in offline mode. The /NET: parameter can coexist
with /READONLY and /NO3D.
