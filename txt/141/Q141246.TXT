SYMPTOMS
========

If you select several objects on a slide and your selection includes the Title
object and/or the Body Text object, the Group command on the Draw menu (on the
Drawing toolbar) is unavailable (dimmed).

RESOLUTION
==========

If you want to make a group that includes the Title or Body Text objects, copy
all the existing objects on the slide to a new slide using the blank AutoLayout
and then you can group them.

1. On the Edit menu, click Select All.

2. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

3. On the Edit menu, click New Slide.

4. In the New Slide dialog box, choose the Blank AutoLayout.

5. On the Edit menu, click Paste Special, then click Objects.

You can now select any combination of the objects on this slide and group them
together.

NOTE: Empty Title and Body Text placeholders cannot be grouped together or
grouped with other objects, even when copied to a new blank slide.
