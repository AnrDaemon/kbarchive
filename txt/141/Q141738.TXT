If you use the REPORT FORM TO FILE ASCII command when the Report form's page
layout is set to landscape and you're using legal size paper (8 1/2 x 14), data
that lies outside the first 11 inches is truncated in the ASCII file. The REPORT
FORM TO PRINT command prints correctly.

the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.
