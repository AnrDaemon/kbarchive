SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a presentation created in a Japanese, Chinese, or Korean version
of PowerPoint (hereinafter referred to as Asian PowerPoint), all the Asian
characters are changed to special characters or symbols. Also, you may receive
the following error message in PowerPoint 7.0 when opening an Asian PowerPoint
presentation:

   This presentation may contain non-displayable text and formats from the Far
   East.


CAUSE
=====

The Asian versions of PowerPoint use a double-byte font set that cannot be used
in the non-Asian versions of PowerPoint. When a non-Asian version of PowerPoint
opens an Asian file, these fonts are translated into symbols, because there is
no matching font set.
