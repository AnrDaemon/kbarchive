SUMMARY
=======

Jet is the default database engine for Visual Basic as well as other Microsoft
applications such as Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel, Project, and Microsoft
Foundation Classes (MFC). Which version of Jet you are using can be unclear
because Visual Basic and other applications using Jet are continually being
updated. The tables and explanations in this article are intended to help you
identify the version and components of Jet that you are using for the given
application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The list below displays which version of Jet is shipped with each of the
following products:

Compatibility Among Versions
----------------------------

With each new version of Microsoft Jet, enhancements in functionality and changes
to the structure of the database file cause problems with backward
compatibility. Wherever possible, efforts have been made to ensure an easy
migration path among versions. However, incompatibilities do exist. The
following table illustrates how database files and objects can be used among
different versions of Microsoft Jet.

Jet Version
                         1.0   1.1   2.0   2.5   3.0   3.5   3.51

-----------------------------------------------------------------
MDB Version      1.0     Y     Y     Y     Y     Y     Y     Y
                 1.1     N     Y     Y     Y     Y     Y     Y
                 2.0     N     N     Y     Y     Y     Y     Y
                 2.5     N     N     N     Y     Y     Y     Y
                 3.0     N     N     N     N     Y     Y     Y
                 3.5     N     N     N     N     N     Y     Y
                 3.51    N     N     N     N     N     N     Y

A "Y" indicates that the database can be used without conversion; "N" indicates
that the database cannot be used or converted. With DAO code you can open any
version of any database up to the same version of Microsoft Jet. However,
Microsoft Access can open only those databases with the same version as itself,
but it can link to tables with the same or earlier version. In other words, if
you upgrade to Microsoft Jet 3.0, you will still be able to read version 2.x
databases.

Notice that Visual Basic 3.0 is capable of using three different versions of Jet
each requiring a separate set of dynamic link libraries (.dlls). This can cause
problems when your Visual Basic application expects to use Jet 2.0 for example,
and then another Visual Basic application using an earlier version of Jet gets
installed on the same system replacing some of the version 2.0 .dlls with
version 1.1. Typically the problem .dll in this situation is VBDB300.DLL because
it determines which version of the Jet engine will be used.

The following table should help you solve any version conflicts and help you
identify the version of Jet you are using. You may use the Wps.exe utility
shipped with Visual Basic to find out which version of Jet you currently have
loaded in memory. Wps.exe is located in the \VB\CDK directory of Visual Basic
3.0 Professional, and in \TOOLS\PSS directory of the Visual Basic 4.0 CD. Pay
special attention to the version information obtained from File Manager (File,
Properties) in Visual Basic 3.0, and Microsoft System Info. in Visual Basic 4.0
32-bit.

The following files are required by Visual Basic to use the Jet Database Engine:
