After starting Setup.exe to install the 16-bit version of Visual Basic 4.0, you
receive the following message:

   This setup program is not intended to be used with this version of Windows.

After starting Setup.exe to install the 32-bit version of Visual Basic 4.0 you
receive one of the following messages:

   The 32-bit version of Visual Basic requires the released version of Windows
   NT 3.51.

-or-

   The 32-bit version of Visual Basic requires the released version of Windows

CAUSE
=====

Visual Basic 4.0 is designed to run only on the released versions of Windows 95,
Windows 98, and Windows NT 3.51 (build 1057) or later. Setup.exe gives you the

of either operating system.

RESOLUTION
==========

Upgrade your operating system to the released version of Windows 95, Windows 98,
Windows NT 3.51 or later.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

Steps to Reproduce

On a machine running Windows NT 3.5 or earlier or a beta copy of Windows 95, run
Setup.exe from the VB 4.0 CD-ROM, or disk 1.

Immediately after starting Setup.exe you will receive one of the error messages
discussed above.
