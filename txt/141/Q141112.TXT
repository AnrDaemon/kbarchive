======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Non Microsoft LPR client prints a Postscript job to a print queue on a
Windows NT Server running the LPD Service, the output is Postscript code instead
of the desired formatted output.

CAUSE
=====

The LPR Client is not sending the correct control code to the Windows NT LPD
Server as defined in RFC1179. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q124735 How Windows NT LPD Server Implements LPR Control Characters

RESOLUTION
==========

If configuring the LPR client is not possible, create a print queue using the
Generic / Text Only driver and direct the output of the queue to the Postscript
printer. This will pass the job through to the Postscript printer unaltered,
except for added carriage returns which Postscript ignores, and the printer will
format the document properly. This queue will only work correctly when sending
Postscript jobs.
