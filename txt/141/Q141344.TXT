TITLE   :Network Connections Refused Over NetBT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You experience problems connecting to Windows NT computers over NetBT (NetBIOS
for TCP/IP). Attempting to connect to the server produces the message:

   System error 53 has occurred
   The network path was not found

Alternatively, attempting to logon to a Windows NT domain from a Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 client may produce the error:

   The password you specified is incorrect or your account is inactive. See your
   network administrator for the password or to activate your account.

This occurs despite providing the correct password, and the account being active.
Stopping and restarting the server service on the affected server resolves the
problem temporarily.

CAUSE
=====

NetBT issues a TCP connection reset (RST) on receipt of a session request
message from the client. This was because NetBT ran out of free connections to
the underlying transport (TCP).


RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been corrected in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
