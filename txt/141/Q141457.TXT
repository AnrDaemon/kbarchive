PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbcode kbCompiler kbCPPonly kbVC kbVC410fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), included with:
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Compiling a C++ file that contains an explicit call to a base class conversion
operator, with the /FR compiler option (create Browser information) may result
in the following fatal compiler error:

   C:\Test\Test.Cpp(22) : fatal error C1001: INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR (compiler
   file 'msc1.cpp', line 899)

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two possible workarounds:

 - Turn off "Generate browse info" or remove /FR compiler option.

-or-

 - Provide an implicit call to the base class conversion operator as
   demonstrated by the following sample code.

Sample Code
-----------

   /* Compile options needed: /FR
   */ 

   class   Base
   {
   public:
       operator int()
       {
           return 0;
       }
   };

   class   Derived : public Base
   {
       int fun()
       {
           return  Base::operator int();

   // The following line is a workaround for the
   // previous line that fails.

      //  return  int(*((Base*)this));
       }
   };
