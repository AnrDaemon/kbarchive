SYMPTOMS
========

When you back up an Exchange Mail Server with Arcada NTBackup or any backup
software without running two required services on the server, one of the
following two error messages appears:

   The specified computer is not a Microsoft Exchange Server or its services are
   not started

or,

   The specified computer cannot be found.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the user fails to run BOTH Directory Service AND
Information Service on the server to back up. These two services are required
for Exchange Server backup.

RESOLUTION
==========

Activate Directory Service and Information Service by performing the following
procedure:

1. Go to the Start Service dialog box.

2. In the Backup Window, choose Operations then choose Microsoft Exchange.

3. In the Server box, type the server name.

4. Select Start Service to enable the Service box.

5. Choose Directory and then Information Store.
