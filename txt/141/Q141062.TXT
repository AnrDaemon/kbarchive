The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2, 3.5 
 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have installed Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows on Microsoft Windows NT,
and you are using the 32-bit version of Mail included with Windows NT, when you
run a Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) application, you may
receive the following error:

   MS MAIL32 Notification: MAPISRV.EXE - Bad Image. The application or
   DLL\DosDevices\C:\WINNT35\system\MSRMT.DLL is not a valid Windows NT image.
   Please check this against your installation diskette.

CAUSE
=====

The error occurs when MAPI calls are thunked to MAPI32.DLL (32-bit MAPI service
provider) that looks for a 32-bit store and transport provider, and they did not
find one because MSRMT.DLL is a 16-bit transport provider.

RESOLUTION
==========

Copy the 16-bit MAPI.DLL (size 53,536 bytes, dated 04-06-93) that came with
Microsoft Remote Mail from the SYSTEM directory to the SYSTEM32 directory.

For example:

   c:\
   cd \winnt\system32
   ren mapi.dll mapi.sav
   copy c:\winnt\system\mapi.dll
