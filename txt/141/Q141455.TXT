KEYWORDS:win95 appscomp kbAppCompatibility

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install Visio Technical version 4.0, standard or Business
Edition, in Windows 95, you may receive the following error message:

   Setup Has Encountered a Problem Please report File='COMMON\LIST1.C' Line =
   1052 To Microsoft Product Support Services Report.

Note that this error message is generated by the Visio Technical Setup program,
not by Windows 95.


CAUSE
=====

According to Visio Technical Support, the error occurs because the CD-ROM drive
is using real mode drivers.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use any one of the following methods:

 - Install protected-mode drivers for the CD-ROM drive if protected- mode
   drivers are available.

 - Copy the Install folder from the Visio Technical CD-ROM to a folder on a
   local or network drive and then run Setup.exe from that folder. This method
   bypasses the CD-ROM drive altogether and should result in a successful
   installation. After Setup is finished, delete the Install folder from the
   local or network drive.

 - The Visio Technical 4.0 package may contain both a CD-ROM and floppy disks.
   If floppy disks are included, run Setup from the floppy disks.
