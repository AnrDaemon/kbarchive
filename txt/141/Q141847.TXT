TITLE   :PPT7: New Slide Dialog Box (AutoLayout) Does Not Appear
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start a new presentation, the New Slide dialog box (where you
can choose an AutoLayout) does not automatically appear.

CAUSE
=====

There are two reasons this behavior can occur:

 - You disabled the Show New Slide Dialog option in the Options dialog box.

   -or-

 - The Blank Presentation.pot file or the template you are using to create the
   presentation already has a slide in it.

   If you create a new presentation based on a presentation that already has a
   slide, the first slide will have the same AutoLayout as the first slide of
   the template. Blank Presentation.pot is the template that PowerPoint uses
   unless you select a different template.

RESOLUTION
==========

Check to see if the Show New Slide Dialog option is selected:

1. On the Tools menu, click Preferences.

2. Click the General tab.

3. See if the Show New Slide Dialog check box is selected. If it is not checked,
   the New Slide dialog box will not appear.

If this box is checked but the New Slide dialog box does not appear when you try
to create a new presentation, follow these steps:

1. On the File menu, click Open.

2. In the Files Of Type list, click Presentation Templates (*.pot).

3. Choose the file called Blank Presentation.pot located in the Microsoft
   PowerPoint:Templates folder, and then click Open.

4. On the Edit menu, click Delete Slide.

5. On the File menu, click Save As.

6. In the Save As Type list, click Presentation Templates (*.pot).

7. Click the existing Blank Presentation.pot file in the folder list box (so
   that it appears in the File Name box).

8. Click Save, and then click Yes.

You can also use these steps to delete the slides from other templates that
contain slides.
