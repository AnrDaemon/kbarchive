SYMPTOMS

If you send an attachment where the first 126 bytes (or more) are null, and the
recipient saves the file to his or her hard disk, it will be saved as a 0 byte
file.

Additionally if you try to run the attachment by double-clicking it, you will
receive the following error message:

   The application for the attached file 'filename' (or one of its components)
   could not be found.


STATUS

for Windows. A fix for this problem is in development, but has not been
regression-tested and may be destabilizing in production environments. Contact
