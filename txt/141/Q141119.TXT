TITLE   :PRB: SMC8432BT-E Fails GetBackUpList Request
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Browsing is very slow when using the SMC8432BT-E network card with NWlink. The
SMC8432BT-E network card is a different card from the SMC8432BT card supported
on the HCL. The SMC8432-E requires a different driver that does not respond to
the GetBackUpList request. As a result of the GetBackUpList request failing, an
election is force each time a browse list is requested. Transport protocols
TCP/IP and Netbeui do not display this problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the SMC8432BT card, another NIC or use the SMC8432BT-E in a computer which
is not a browser.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SMC8432BT-E card is physically different, the most obvious difference is the
EPROM socket located on the card. This socket provides re-boot support for
diskless workstations. SMC has not clearly marked this card as a different card
from the SMC8432BT. However, a loose leaf sheet added to the orginal SMC8432BT
manual is included.
