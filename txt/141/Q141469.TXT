-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 SP1, 3.51 SP2, 3.51 SP3, 3.51 SP4, 3.51 SP5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51 SP1, 3.51 SP2, 3.51 SP3, 3.51 SP4, 3.51 SP5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to install a Windows NT Service Pack over the network using the
UPDATE.EXE program located on the DISK1 of the Service Pack floppy disk set, the
installation fails with the following error:

   An error has occurred. Unable to open the file X:\disk1\BROWSER.DLL.

   You may continue (ignoring the error), retry the operation, or exit Setup. If
   you choose to ignore the error, Setup may not be able to completely and/or
   correctly install the software. If you exit, you will have to repeat the
   Setup process from the beginning.

   Ignore Retry Exit Setup

(where "X:" is your redirected drive)

CAUSE
=====

UPDATE.EXE is not supposed to be used over the network. The UPDATE.EXE program
uses an UPDATE.INF file which contains Source Media Descriptions to disk
directory labels. When the program recognizes the install is not from floppy
disks, it expects all files to be in the same directory. This is expected
behavior.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, copy all files from the Disk X directories into a
single directory on a local hard drive or network share. Then run the UPDATE.EXE
program from that common directory.
