PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When previewing the Customer listing report in the Tastraders application, you
may notice that the date or page number has been truncated.

CAUSE
=====

This is typically caused by the printer driver that is being used, although the
date output may also be affected by the CENTURY setting in Visual FoxPro. If
Century is turned on, you may only see 19 and not the complete date.

WORKAROUND
==========

You may need to move some of the report objects away from the outer edges of the
report or consider using a somewhat smaller font.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.
