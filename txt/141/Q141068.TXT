-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install Electronic Forms Designer (E-form) on a Microsoft
Windows 95 computer, you may get the following error message after you run
SETUP.EXE:

   Error could not execute C:\WINDOWS\CMDKINST.EXE 2

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur if the E-forms Setup disk has been updated to a newer
version and the CMDKINST.EXE file is not present in the Windows directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: The file sizes and dates for Electronic Forms Designer Setup files on Disk
1 are:

SETUP.EXE         15,360       9/20/93      12:59pm
USERINST.EX_      37,205      10/13/93       5:58pm

You can use one of the following workarounds when you get the above error
message:

1. Get the newest version of the updated Setup files, version 1.03 from Product
   Support Services.

   File sizes and dates for latest updated Setup files:

    SETUP.EXE            15,360        4/24/95        3:24pm
    VER.DL_               9,696        11/1/93        5:11am
    CMDKINST.EXE         71,240        4/27/95        8:23pm
    CMDKINST.EX_         31,231        4/27/95        8:23pm

2. Use the expand command and expand a new version from the E-forms Setup disk
   that you are using. This can be done because the setup files (version 1.01)
   does not expand the CMDKINST.EX_ correctly; however, you can correctly
   manually expand the file yourself. The following syntax is required for a
   manual expand:

   expand a:\cmdkinst.ex_ c:\<windir>\cmdinst.exe

3. Rename the C:\<WINDIR>\CMDKINST.EX to C\<WINDIR>\CMDKINST.EXE and
   restart the E-forms Setup program.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 1.0 of Microsoft
Electronic Forms Designer. A fix for this problem is in development, but has not
been regression-tested and may be destabilizing in production environments.
Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information on the
availability of this fix.
