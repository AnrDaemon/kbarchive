TITLE   :XCLN: Err Msg: Form You Selected Could Not be Displayed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may get the following error message when you try to compose or read a
Microsoft Exchange Electronic Forms Designer form:

   The form you selected could not be displayed. There is not enough disk space
   to copy the form to your computer. Close some forms to increase the maximum
   space for forms using the option command on the tools menu. [80040119]

CAUSE
=====

The problem can be caused by insufficient temporary storage space allocated for
the form. The default size permitted is 1024 kilobytes (KB). Therefore,
electronic forms larger than approximately 1 megabyte (MB), the temporary
storage size, will have to be increased.

RESOLUTION
==========

To increase the temporary storage space for forms in the Microsoft Exchange
client, select Tools, Options, Exchange Server page, and increase the Temporary
storage for forms field.
