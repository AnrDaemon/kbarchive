KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows 1995 edition 
 - Microsoft Bookshelf '95 for Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Bookshelf 1996-97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you perform a search using QuickShelf, you cannot spell check search items,
even if the Automatic Spelling feature is turned on in Bookshelf. After you
select a misspelled word and click the All Books Find button, you receive the
message:

   No articles were found that match the criteria you selected.

If you click the All Books Contents button, the entry closest to the highlighted
word (in alphabetical order) is selected. If you are using Microsoft Windows
3.x, you might receive the following error message:

   The word(s) could not be found in the Table of Contents.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Bookshelf programs listed at
the top of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

WORKAROUND
==========

To spell check while searching, use Bookshelf instead of QuickShelf.

Start Bookshelf and keep the program minimized while you use other programs. This
way you have quick access to Bookshelf and can easily start your search.
