-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You drag a field from a form's data environment to a grid you are editing and an
error occurs that gives the following message:

   Parent object will not allow this property setting for
   Formset1.Form1.Grid1.Column1.Text1.ControlSource.

   -or-

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down. If the
   problem persists, contact the program vendor.

NOTE: the error wording is from Windows 95. In other versions of Windows, a
general protection (GP) fault occurs with different wording.

The first error occurs if:

 - You drop the field on an exposed column in the grid and you are using Visual
   FoxPro version 3.0 for Windows.

 - You drop the field on any part of the grid and you are using Visual FoxPro
   version 3.0b for Windows.

The second error occurs if you drop the field on the area of the grid other than
an exposed column and you are using Visual FoxPro version 3.0 for Windows.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Drag and drop succeeds in placing the TextBox object into the exposed column but
does not allow the ControlSource to be set.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a new form, and place a grid on the form from the Form Designer
   toolbar. Set the grid's ColumnCount property to 1.

2. Right-click the form, and select Data Environment. Then right-click the Data
   Environment window, and select Add.

3. Select a table and add it to the Data Environment.

4. Right-click the grid, and select Edit.

5. Drag a field from the table in the Data Environment, and drop it on the
   exposed column in the grid. At this point, the first error occurs. If you
   examine the Column in the Property Sheet Object list box, you may note the
   added text box is now present but the ControlSource property for that text
   box is not set.

6. Drag a field from the table in the Data Environment, and drop it anywhere on
   the grid other than the exposed column. At this point, the second error (a GP
   fault) occurs in Visual FoxPro version 3.0 for Windows.
