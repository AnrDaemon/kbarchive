TITLE   :File & Print Services for NetWare Volume Disappears After Reboot
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you reboot your Windows NT computer running File & Print Services for
NetWare (FPNW), after creating FPNW volumes the new volumes disappear. In some
cases you may also lose existing volumes after reboot.

CAUSE
=====

If the FPNW Service Account does not have at least minimum access rights to the
directory, then after rebooting, the FPNW volumes will be inaccessible to the
NetWare clients.

If you attempt to create an FPNW volume on a directory with a very 'limited'
access, FPNW will allow you to create the volume, but after reboot the volume
will disappear.

In a different scenario, if you attempt to restrict the directory permissions on
an NTFS volume, which is also configured as an FPNW volume, it may become
inaccessible to the NetWare clients after you reboot your machine or stop and
start the FPNW service.

WORKAROUND
==========

To workaround this problem, give the local Administrators group, Everyone or
FPNW Service Account at least "List" rights to the directory where you want to
create an FPNW volume.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT File & Print
Services for NetWare version 3.51. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

NetWare is manufactured by Novell, Inc., a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
