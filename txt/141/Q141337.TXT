SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Exchange Clients, the following error message may be displayed when
you try to open a typical message (IPM.Note):

   The item could not be displayed. The form could not be loaded. Launching
   default form instead.

CAUSE
=====

This error message can occur if the Frmcache.dat and Frmcache.bak files are
missing from the Windir\Forms folder. Windir is the Windows subfolder, and
Frmcache.dat is the Microsoft Exchange Electronic Forms Designer cache that is
used to pass information to Microsoft Exchange Server regarding message item
types. Frmcache.bak is a backup file to Frmcache.dat that is updated and always
contains electronic forms cache information prior to the last update.

RESOLUTION
==========

Replace Frmcache.dat by restoring the file to the Windir\Forms folder.
