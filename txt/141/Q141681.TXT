and your Visual Basic program ends due to an application error:

   This item's control has been deleted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start the 32-bit version of Visual Basic 4.0 or if it is already running, on
   the File menu, click New Project.

2. Add a ListView control to the Form1 form.

3. Add the following code to the Form1 code window:

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            Call ListView1.ListItems.Add(, , "Edit this Line")
         End Sub

         Private Sub ListView1_AfterLabelEdit(Cancel As Integer, _
                                               NewString As String)
            ListView1.ListItems.Clear
         End Sub

         Private Sub ListView1_Click()
            'Without this line in this event, you have to triple-click
            'in order to edit the listitem
            ListView1.StartLabelEdit
         End sub

4. Press the F5 key to start the program. Click the ListItem in the ListView
   control.

5. Delete the ListItem text by pressing the DEL key, and then press the ENTER
   key. The Windows Common Controls dialog box with the message, "This item's
   control has been deleted." displays. Click the OK button. An application
   error occurs with one of the following messages and Visual Basic stops with
   an application error:


   

      Windows NT 3.51-An application error has occurred and an application
                      error log is being generated. VB32.exe. Exception:
