SYMPTOMS
========

In Dangerous Creatures, you hear a slight sound distortion prior to hearing new
sounds and narration when you click Back after you have made jumps to new
articles.

The sound distortion is minor and does not affect all articles.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do the following:

1. On the main article menu, click Options. The option is located at the bottom
   of the screen.

2. Click Sounds.

3. Remove the check mark from the Sound Effects box. The check mark indicates
   Sound Effects are active.

   NOTE: Removing the check mark turns off all the Dangerous Creatures background
   sound effects. This does not affect the narrations associated with different
   articles, however, the sound effects are a major portion of the program. It
   is recommended that you leave the option turned on.

4. Click OK.

5. Close the Options dialog box.
