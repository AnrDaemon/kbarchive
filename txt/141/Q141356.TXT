TITLE   :FIX: PageFrame Refresh Fails with Stacked Pages
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During design mode in the Form Designer when all of the following conditions are
true, the display will not refresh properly unless you press ALT+TAB to move
away from Visual FoxPro and come back to it again:

 - A PageFrame on the form

 - The TabStretch property set to 0 (Stack).

 - You have several rows of pages.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in FoxPro 3.0b for
Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. In the Command window, type the following command:

   " CREATE FORM myform" (without the quotation marks)

2. Add a PageFrame object to the form, and set the following properties:

   PageCount = 5
   TabStretch = 0 - Stack

3. Edit the PageFrame object, and decrease its horizontal width so that there
   are three rows of pages.

4. Change the Caption property of each page to be just the page number (1, 2, 3,
   and so on).

At the point at which the pages fit back into a single row, the refresh is
incomplete. To refresh the form, press ALT+TAB to move away from Visual FoxPro
and then return to it.
