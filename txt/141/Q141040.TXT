TITLE   :BUG: Step Out in Debugger Ignores Try/Catch Scope
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDebug kbide

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Integrated Debugger, used with:
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The debug Step Out command does not step you to the expected function when used
within try/catch blocks.

RESOLUTION
==========

As an alternative to Step Out, use one of the other debug step options such as
Run to Cursor or Step Over.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you debug an application that uses either the C++ try or catch keywords or
the MFC TRY or CATCH macros, attempting to step out of the try or catch block
results in popping two frames off the stack. While executing code within the try
block or the catch block, Step Out should step you out of the block and into the
function that contains the try/catch blocks. Step Out instead takes you to the
function that called the function containing the try/catch blocks.
