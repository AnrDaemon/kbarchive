TITLE   :FIX: Distributed Application Allows Setup /a
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:3.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The setup program created by the Visual FoxPro Setup Wizard is not intended to
be used to set up a Visual FoxPro application to run from a network server.
Although the setup program will allow the administrative setup option (Setup
/a), the application will not be installed correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The option for an administrative install is provided through the setup table
files (*.stf). There are three different .stf files, one for each supported
platform. They are located in the disk 1 or netsetup directory. The .stf files
and their associated operating systems are listed below.

   .STF File Name    Operating System
   --------------------------------------------------------
   Setup16.stf       Windows or Windows for Workgroups 3.11
   Setup32.stf       Windows NT
   Setup95.stf       Windows 95

WORKAROUND
==========

The .stf files can be modified to disable the administrative setup option. by
using any standard text editor such as Notepad. Locate the following line in the
Setup16.stf file:

      Admin Mode Root Object ID     7:02

Delete all text on this line, but do not delete the line itself. There should be
a blank line left in place of the text. Repeat this process for the other two
.stf files (Setup32.stf and Setup95.stf). All three of the .stf files must be
changed to disable this option on all three supported operating systems. Once
the .stf files have been modified and saved, setup displays the following error
immediately after an attempt to run Setup /a as it should:

   Setup does not support being run in this mode.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual FoxPro 3.0b
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Using the setup wizard, create a set of distribution disks.

2. Run Setup /a from the distribution disks. Setup continues as though it is
   performing an administrative install even though it does not support this
   option.
