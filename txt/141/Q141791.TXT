SYMPTOMS
========

In the User Manager for Domains you get the following error message when trying
to manage a user or group account with a name created with the ADDUSERS.EXE
utility included in the Windows NT Resource kit:

   User Manager for Domains

   %user/group name%:

   The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.
   The user/group properties cannot be edited or viewed at this time.

CAUSE
=====

When you used the ADDUSERS.EXE utility to create a user or group account name
containing one or more invalid characters, the utility failed to check for
invalid characters and give you an error message.

A Windows NT user name or global group name can be up to 20 characters long. It
can contain any upper case or lower case character except the following:

   " / \ [ ] : ; | = , + * ? >.

In addition to the above characters, a Windows NT user name or group name can not
contain a tab entry.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Windows NT Workstation and Server version
4.0.

To work around this problem:

 - Delete User accounts with invalid names by using ADDUSERS.EXE with the /e
   switch. Use ADDUSERS /? for more details.

 - Restore a good accounts database from a backup tape.

NOTE: User or Group accounts with invalid names can not be deleted from the User
Manager for Domains. The ADDUSERS utility can delete the user and group accounts
with invalid names. You will receive the following error when attempting to
delete the invalid accounts:
