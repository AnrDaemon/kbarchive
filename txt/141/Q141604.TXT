The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

There are at least two ways to bring Harvard Graphics for Windows slides into
Microsoft PowerPoint. Both methods require that Harvard Graphics and PowerPoint
be installed on the same computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Method 1: Use a Copy and Paste Operation
----------------------------------------

From Slide Sorter view in Harvard Graphics, copy a slide, and then paste it onto
a blank slide in PowerPoint.

Method 2: Insert the Slides as OLE Objects
------------------------------------------

1. In PowerPoint, click Object on the Insert menu.

2. In the Object Type list, click Harvard Graphics Slide(s).

3. Click the Existing Slide(s) button.

4. In the Open For Embedded dialog box, switch to the folder containing the
   Harvard Graphics file and select a .prs file.

5. Switch to the desired slide and click Update <filename> on the File
   menu. If you don't do this, you receive an image of the first slide in the
   .prs file when you return to PowerPoint.

6. On the File menu, click "Close and Return to PowerPoint."

7. Resize the Harvard Graphics object to fill the PowerPoint slide.

Both of these methods bring in only one Harvard Graphics slide at a time.

Microsoft PowerPoint ships with translators for opening Harvard Graphics versions
2.3 and 3.0 for DOS. PowerPoint does not ship with translators for any version
of Harvard Graphics for Windows.
