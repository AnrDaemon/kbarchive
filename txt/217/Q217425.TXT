SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Posting Acceptor is a server add-on component in the Windows NT Option
Pack (NTOP) that enables the use of HTTP Post (RFC 1867) to publish content to
your Web site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To get Posting Acceptor to work with as few steps as possible, perform the
following steps:

1. Install Posting Acceptor using one of the following methods:

    - Install Posting Acceptor during the NTOP installation.

   -OR-

    - Run the NTOP setup and specify Add/Remove.

2. In either of the above methods, specify the installation of Posting Acceptor,
   by doing the following:

   a. Select Microsoft Site Server Express 2.0.

   b. Click Show Subcomponents.

   c. Select Publishing - Posting Acceptor.

   d. Click OK and complete the wizard.

3. Verify that the Cpshost.dll file is in your Scripts folder.

4. Create a new directory named Uploads and give it at least NTFS Add
   permissions to valid users, but ensure that the "Everyone" and
   IUSR_COMPUTERNAME accounts do not have rights to the folder.

5. Create a new virtual directory that points to the new Uploads directory with
   write access.

6. Create a new text file named Postacpt.asp in your Scripts folder and paste
   the following HTML code into it:

   <SCRIPT RUNAT=SERVER LANGUAGE="JavaScript">
    if (Request.ServerVariables("LOGON_USER") == '')
      Response.Status('401 Access Denied');
   </SCRIPT>
   <html>
   <body>
   <form enctype="multipart/form-data" action="/scripts/cpshost.dll?PUBLISH" method="POST">
    <center><table>
      <tr>
        <td align="left">File to upload</td>
        <td align="left"><input name="file" type="file" size="20"></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="left">Destination URL</td>
        <td align="left"><input name="TargetURL" value="/uploads/" size="20">
        <input type="Submit" value="Upload..."></td>
      </tr>
    <table></center>
   </form>
   </body>
   </html>

   Notes on the above code sample:

    - The JavaScript code forces a browser to authenticate. You can remove this
      code to allow anonymous posting, otherwise you will need to add
      users/groups as specified in the step above.

    - The form uses a new input of type "file" that should display a Browse
      button on the Web page.

7. Browse the page at "http://localhost/scripts/postacpt.asp" and upload a file
   to verify the correct functionality.
