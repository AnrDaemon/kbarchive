PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Internet Mail Service sends notification to the Administrator mailbox for an
Unknown recipient for which this option is not selected in the Internet Mail
Service Notification window in the Exchange Administrator program.

CAUSE
=====

The Diagnostic and Reason codes for the option "email address could not be
found" are being improperly set to match the Diagnostic and Reason codes for the
option "destination host not found". Therefore, the Administrator's mailbox
receives notification for this type of mail delivery failure.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
