TITLE   :GetHostByName API Returns Unbindable Addresses
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4, Windows Sockets applications
using the "bind()" function with IP address information retrieved using
"GetHostByName()" to return localhost IP addresses may fail and return the
following error message:

   10049 (WSAEADDRNOTAVAIL)

CAUSE
=====

A change was introduced in Service Pack 4 that causes NDISWAN Services to return
IP addresses in the order in which they are bound. This change resulted in IP
addresses not currently bound to the TCP/IP stack to be returned when making a
call to the Winsock API function GetHostbyName(). Sockets applications using the
"bind()" function for individual addresses returned from "GetHostByName()" on
systems running the RAS (Remote Access Server) Service may experience this
problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
