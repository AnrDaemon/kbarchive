PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbservicepack kbCompiler kbVC600 kbVS600sp2 kbVS600SP1 kbVS600sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Virtual Device Driver (VxD) or driver built with Visual C++ fails to load or
run.

CAUSE
=====

The /ZI compiler option (debug info for Edit and Continue) uses the the compiler
option /GF (constant string pooling) which places strings in .rdata. It is the
presence of .rdata that causes the VxDs to fail. This option is turned on by
default when a project is ported from Visual C++ version 5.0 to version 6.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the /ZI compiler option or use /Zi instead.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information
