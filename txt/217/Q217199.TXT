TITLE   :Static WINS Entries Cause the Network Name to Go Offline
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2000,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Cluster Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Datacenter Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you add static entries in the WINS database for a server cluster virtual
server, the network name resource may fail to come online.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) attempts to dynamically create WINS entries for
Network Name resources when they are brought online, if the entries cannot be
created (in this case because static entries already exist) then the cluster
service will fail the resources.

MSCS virtual servers use static IP addresses, static WINS entries are not
necessary. Using static WINS entries will prevent failover from occurring.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, remove static entries for the clusters network name
resources from the WINS database.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WINS entries from a WINS replication partner may cause the static WINS entries
to be replicated back to the server from which the entries have been removed.
Verify that all static mappings in WINS that reference the clusters virtual
network names are removed from all WINS servers.
