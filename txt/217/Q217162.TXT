======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server 2.0 requires Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 4 or
later to be installed on the computer. As a convenience, the Windows NT Server
4.0 Service Pack 4 files are included on the Systems Management Server 2.0
distribution media. However, the directory containing these service pack files
is incorrectly named "Nt4sp4a", which implies that it is a newer, updated
version of the Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 files.

Additionally, the initial Systems Management Server 2.0 Setup screen incorrectly
has an option to "Install NT 4.0 SP4a", and the Systems Management Server 2.0
Release Notes incorrectly refers to "Service Pack 4a for Windows NT Server 4.0".

CAUSE
=====

These are all typographical errors in the Systems Management Server 2.0 media.

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 included with Systems Management Server 2.0 comes
with Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01 Service Pack 1a; this is the probable
source of the confusion.

WORKAROUND
==========

References to "Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 4a" should be ignored and
considered to be "Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 4" instead.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because Systems Management Server 2.0 is distributed internationally, the
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 files included on the Systems Management Server
2.0 distribution media are the 40-bit encrypted versions. Using these files is
not required to use Systems Management Server 2.0; that is, you can use the
128-bit encrypted Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 4 files if you obtain them
from another source (for example, a Web download, an internal share point, and
so on).

This error will be corrected in a future release of Systems Management Server
2.0.
