TITLE   :XCON: DRAS Fails with Event 9322
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect two Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 computers using
the Dynamic RAS (DRAS) connector over TCP/IP, and the servers are in two
different, untrusted domains, the Exchange Server computer that dials may log a
9318 and a 289 message transfer agent (MTA) event in the application log. The
Exchange Server computer that is being dialed into will log a 9322 event with a
Windows NT/MTA error of 5:

   9322: MSExchangeMTA
   An interface error has occurred. An MtaBindBack over RPC has failed.
   Locality Table (LTAB) index: %1, NT/MTA error code:5.
   Comms error %3, Bind error %4,Remote Server Name %5, Protocol String %6 [%7 %8
   %9 %10]

CAUSE
=====

A Windows NT error code of 5 signifies that there is a security problem between
the two servers.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Create a new Windows NT user account called RASCON. Repeat this process on
   each of the untrusted domains.

2. Give the new RASCON accounts the exact same password.

3. Add the RASCON account to the Domain Admins group.

4. Verify that the RASCON account has permission to log onto the Exchange Server
   computer. This is done using the Windows NT User Manager.

5. Within the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, give the new RASCON
   account Service Account Admin permission at the Organization, Site, and
   Configuration levels of the Exchange Server computer.

6. Adjust the RAS Override tab of the DRAS connector to use these new accounts
   on both Exchange Server computers.

7. Retest mail flow over the DRAS Connector.
