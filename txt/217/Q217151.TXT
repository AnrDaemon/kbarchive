   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

Index Server reports that the catalog is corrupt after the index process is
completed. This can occur as soon as the indexing process has completed, or
several minutes later.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs when a file is unfilterable and the Filter Retries is set to a
number greater than 4. When this happens, the information that the filter
process sends to the Content Index Service (CISVS) causes the CISVS to report
that the in-memory catalog information is corrupt, even though the data on the
drive is fine.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Change the value of the following registry key to a value of 4 or less:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\system\currentcontrolset\control\contentindex\FilterRetries

After you change this value, restart Index Server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Index Server version 2.0.
