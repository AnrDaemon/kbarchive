The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server version 4.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Manage Electronic Mail console provides a summary of e-mail flow and
management in a BackOffice Small Business Server-based network. When Microsoft
Exchange Server is installed on the Small Business Server computer, the Outgoing
E-mail displays the number of outbound messages awaiting delivery in the
Internet Mail Service Outbound Queue and the Incoming E-mail displays the number
of inbound messages awaiting delivery in the Internet Mail Service Inbound
Queue.

Messages from the Internet are received by the Internet Mail Service. The
Internet Mail Service processes the messages by delivering mail to the
appropriate Exchange recipient mailbox. Because the Internet Mail Service
processes these messages quickly, this value generally reads "0" unless your
organization receives large quantities of Internet mail.

Messages awaiting delivery to the Internet will appear more often because the
Internet Mail Service connects on a scheduled basis and this queue reflects
messages waiting to be delivered externally.

MORE INFORMATION
================

These values are automatically updated every 15 minutes. To update the values
manually, press F5, or right-click the page and then click Refresh.

This behavior is modified from previous versions of Small Business Server where
the page refreshes as frequently as every five seconds.
