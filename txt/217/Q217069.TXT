TITLE   :Serial Printer Communication Fault Pop-up Notification Available
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When serially connected printers experience a communication break or an out of
resource condition such as out of paper on Windows NT 4.0, this is not
communicated back to the server through a dialog box or a pop-up message. It
simply stops printing to the printer, and continues spooling the print job in
the spooler until it is finished being sent from the client. The print job will
now sit in the spooler until someone resolves the communication or resource
problem. If the print job is restarted before the printer problem is resolved,
it is possible for the spooler to think the printer problem is resolved and send
the spooled up print job to the bit bucket.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0. This problem was
first corrected in Windows NT version 4.0 Service Pack 5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The updated code now creates a pop-up message when a communication error occurs.
The user can respond to the fault when it has been resolved. If the fault is
resolved but you cannot get to the server to respond, the system will
automatically retry approximately every 5 seconds, and, if successful, will
remove the pop-up message.
