TITLE   :XFOR: How to Enable DBCS Support on the Exchange Notes Connector
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

With the release of the new and enhanced Exchange Notes Connector in the Web 2
update, Double Byte Character Sets (DBCS) between Exchange Server and Lotus
Notes is now supported. Most Asian languages are DBCS-based, such as the
following:

 - Chinese-Simplified
 - Chinese-Traditional
 - Japanese (Kanji)
 - Korean

DBCS support is seamlessly integrated with the U.S. English versions of the
Exchange Notes Connector and Exchange Server. This article explains the steps
needed to get this working.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On the Exchange Server Computer with the Exchange Notes Connector
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Locate the DBCS language you want from the Langpack folder on the Windows NT
   4.0 CD.

2. Right-click on the .inf file, and click Install; this adds the DBCS language
   you want to the list in regional settings.

3. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and double-click
   Regional Settings.

4. On the Regional Settings tab, select the language you want from the list, and
   click to select the "Set as system default locale" check box.

5. Click the Input Locales tab.

6. Select the locale you want, and click the "Set as Default" button.

7. Reboot the computer running Windows NT Server.

8. Install the U.S. English version of Exchange Server with Service Pack 1 or
   later.

9. Install the U.S. English version of the Exchange Notes Connector (Service
   Pack 2).

10. Install the international version of the Lotus Notes client 4.5.<x> or
   4.6.<x>.

11. On the Options tab of the Notes Connector Property pages, select the Notes
   server language based on the DBCS client language you want, and not on the
   actual language of the corresponding Notes server.

12. Follow the normal procedures for completing the configuration of the
   Exchange Notes Connector.

On International Notes Server
-----------------------------

1. The Notes server does not have to be the same DBCS language as specified on
   the Notes Connector Options tab. It appears that installing the U.S. English
   version of the Notes server preserves the DBCS information for the Notes
   user.

2. Create a Notes user ID for the connector. Note that the Security Type should
   be International for non-U.S. English versions of the Notes server, not North
   American. Otherwise, the ID file is not usable by the Notes client.

After you finish the configuration of the Exchange Notes Connector, all DBCS
information in the message header or body, and directory information is
preserved between Exchange Server and Lotus Notes.
