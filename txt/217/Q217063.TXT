TITLE   :Terminal Server Hangs and Does Not Allow Network Connections
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:_IK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT Server, Terminal Server Edition may stop responding (hang). Even
though you may be able to ping the computer, you cannot perform a NET VIEW or
make any connections to the it. At this point, you must turn off and then turn
the computer back on (hard reset).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal
Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT Server 4.0,
Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To verify that you are experiencing this issue, a kernel debugger needs to be
attached to the computer and you would need to look at the following to identify
this issue:

   Dd ExWorkerQueue+10 l1	// flink pointer to Critical Queue
   Dl flink

The fourth dword should be the function. Generally, most systems are configured
for about nine threads to work off the queue. So, if you see a block of greater
than nine to the same function at the top of the queue, that is a good indicator
that there is potentially a problem.

Run the system a little and see if the top nine addresses change at all. If not,
trace through the functions and see if there is any way that the thread could
block waiting on additional work to be done in the queue.

If so, and if a system runs fast enough (multiprocessor systems) to block all
nine, you have a hung system that is running into this problem.
