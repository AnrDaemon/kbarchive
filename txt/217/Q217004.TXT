TITLE   :BackOffice Installer Tool Does Not Delete Password Cache File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use BackOffice Server version 4.0 to install Microsoft SQL Server,
Microsoft Exchange Server, or Microsoft Transaction Server, you are required to
provide a user account and password during the installation of each product.
This information is stored in the Reboot.ini file to automate part of the
installation process. However, upon completion, the installation tool does not
delete the Reboot.ini file and the file can then be accessed if:

 - A user has security permission to log on to the server locally.

 - The folder containing the Reboot.ini file is shared and a user has security
   permissions to that shared folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent the Reboot.ini file from being read by an unauthorized user:

1. At a command prompt, change to the Program Files\Microsoft BackOffice folder
   on the partition where the BackOffice server was installed.

2. Type "del reboot.ini" (without the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

NOTE: It will not be necessary to repeat this process at any future time unless
the BackOffice installation tool is used again.
