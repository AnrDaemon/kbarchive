TITLE   :FIX: Application Crashes When Run in Debugger
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler

KEYWORDS:kbservicepack kbVC600 kbVS600sp2 kbVS600SP1 kbVS600sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An application runs as expected outside of the debugger but causes an
application error like this when run in the debugger:

   System Process - Application Error
   The Application failed to initialize properly (0xc00000005)

Another symptom appears if the reserve value specified for the HEAP linker option
is smaller than the commit value: The reserve value is silently increased to the
commit value.

CAUSE
=====

The heap reserve size is smaller than the commit size. This means that
applications that rely on these values (such as the debugger) are not able to
load the binary image.

RESOLUTION
==========

The heap reserve size should always be greater than or equal to the commit size.
The linker provided in Service Pack 3 checks these values. If the reserve value
is less than the commit value, the linker generates a fatal error. For example,
linking with the option /HEAP:0x400,0x1000 causes this error:

   LNK1229: Commit size greater than the reserve size in "/HEAP"

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information
about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

To view the reserve and commit values for an executable, use the dumpbin
utility:

   dumpbin /headers filename.exe
