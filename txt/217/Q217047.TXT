TITLE   :PRB: CD Key Invalid for Visual Basic 6.0 Deluxe Learning Edition
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbVBp600 kbLEdition kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Setup program of the Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Deluxe Learning Edition from
Microsoft Press requires a 10-digit CD key. However, the CD key sticker on the
back of your jewel case may contain an 11-digit CD key.

NOTE: This applies to the Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Deluxe Learning Edition
only.

CAUSE
=====

Initially, the wrong type of CD key stickers were used with this product.

RESOLUTION
==========

It is possible to use the 11-digit CD key that was included with the Visual
Basic 6.0 Deluxe Learning Edition CD-ROM. To do this, you must remove the last
digit from the first group of four numbers. In other words, if the CD key
reads:

   1234-5678907

Remove the "4" and enter the CD key as follows:

   123-5678907

This allows the product to install correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0
Deluxe Learning Edition.
