SUMMARY
=======

This article describes a virtual private networking (VPN) solution called
Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), which allow clients located on the
Internet to connect to a private corporate network on a Remote Access Service
(RAS) or a Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) server that is multihomed
with two network adapters.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In this configuration, one network adapter is attached to the private corporate
network and the other is attached to an Internet service provider (ISP)
network.

The default gateway must point only to the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the
router located on the Internet side. This ensures that all IP traffic sent to
clients located on the Internet is properly routed.

For IP traffic sent to clients located on the private corporate network, it may
be necessary to add static routes or a routing protocol on a RAS or RRAS server
to ensure traffic is properly routed.
