TITLE   :Unable to Bring New Network Name Resource On Line
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbnetwork kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Cluster Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you create a network name resource on a Microsoft Windows NT-based server
running Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4, when you try to bring the resource on
line, it may fail over to the other node. When this occurs, it may fail between
both nodes until it goes off line.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the "Enable NetBIOS for this IP address" feature is
disabled for your network name resource. Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 enables
the "Enable NetBIOS for this IP address" feature, and if this feature is
disabled, any network name resource that depends on that Internet protocol (IP)
address does not work when you try to bring it on line. Note that this behavior
can inadvertently be caused by using the Cluster Administrator tool on a
computer running Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 to administer a cluster that has
been updated to Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, verify that the "Enable NetBIOS for this IP address"
feature is enabled for your network name resource or resources by using the
version of Cluster Administrator that is included with Windows NT 4.0 Service
Pack 4.


STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
