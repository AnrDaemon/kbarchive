SUMMARY
=======

The Data Access Object (DAO) documentation that comes with Microsoft Access and
Visual Basic Online help shows how to open a Paradox table. However, it does not
show how to open a table that is password protected.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To open a Paradox table, the documentation states that you must specify Paradox
3.x, Paradox 4.x, or Paradox 5.x in the connect string. However, the
documentation omits the PWD argument in the connect string. PWD is used to
specify the Paradox password, just as it is used when opening password-protected
ODBC or Jet tables.

The following code samples show the correct use of the PWD option when opening
password-protected Paradox tables. In each of the samples, the table is
C:\MYDATA\Table1.DB and the password is "ABC".

NOTE: The period in the Paradox file name needs to be replaced by the # symbol.
This is because Microsoft Jet uses the period to separate database and table
names and to separate table and field names. For example, Table1.DB needs to be
written as Table1#DB when referring to the table in Jet.

Attaching/Linking a password-protected table:
---------------------------------------------

   Dim db As DAO.Database
   Dim td As DAO.TableDef
   Dim rs As DAO.Recordset

   Set db = OpenDatabase(App.Path & "\NWIND.MDB")

   Set td = db.CreateTableDef("Table1")
   td.Connect = "Paradox 4.x;PWD=ABC;DATABASE=C:\MYDATA;"
   td.SourceTableName = "Table1#DB"
   db.TableDefs.Append td

   Set rs = db.OpenRecordset("Table1")

Opening directly using a Database object:
-----------------------------------------

In this case, the database is the directory where the tables reside. If all
tables have the same password, you can open them from the same Database object.
If the tables have different passwords, you will need to open a different
Database object for each unique password.

   Set db = DBEngine(0).OpenDatabase("C:\MYDATA", 0, 0, "Paradox 4.x;PWD=ABC;")

   Set rs = db.OpenRecordset("Table1#DB")

Referencing a Paradox table directly in SQL statements
------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Jet allows use of an IN clause or the [Database].[Table] syntax to
reference a table outside the current database. The [Database].[Table] syntax is
preferred.

   Set db = OpenDatabase(App.Path & "\NWIND.MDB")

   Set rs = db.OpenRecordset("SELECT * FROM [Paradox 3.x;DATABASE=C:\MYDATA;PWD=ABC].[Table1#DB]")
   '
   ' Or
   '
   Set rs = db.OpenRecordset("SELECT * FROM [Table1#DB] IN '' [Paradox 3.x;DATABASE=C:\MYDATA;PWD=ABC]")
   '
   ' Or
   '
   Set rs = db.OpenRecordset("SELECT * FROM [Table1#DB] IN 'C:\MYDATA' [Paradox 3.x;PWD=ABC]")

You can also use action queries with the same direct SQL technique:

   ' Make a new table Access "LocalTable" from data in Paradox table.

   Set db = OpenDatabase(App.Path & "\NWIND.MDB")

   db.Execute "SELECT * INTO LocalTable FROM [Paradox 3.x;DATABASE=C:\MYDATA;PWD=ABC].[Table1#DB]"

   ' Append data into an Access table "LocalTable" from Paradox table.

   db.Execute "INSERT INTO LocalTable SELECT * FROM [Paradox 3.x;DATABASE=C:\MYDATA;PWD=ABC].[Table1#DB]"

   ' Append data into a Paradox table from an Access table "LocalTable". 

   db.Execute "INSERT INTO [Paradox 3.x;DATABASE=C:\MYDATA;PWD=ABC].[Table1#DB] SELECT * FROM LocalTable"

   ' Delete records from a Paradox table.

   db.Execute "DELETE FROM [Paradox 3.x;DATABASE=C:\MYDATA;PWD=ABC].[Table1#DB] WHERE Field1 = 55"
