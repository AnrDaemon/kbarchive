TITLE   :INF: Default Schema to be Used with ODBC Driver for DB2 and OLE
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2, version 4.0 SP2 
 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2, version 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Default Schema is the name of the DB2 collection where the driver or the
provider looks for catalog information. This is an optional parameter that can
be specified while configuring ODBC and OLE DB Data Sources for DB2 to restrict
results sets for popular operations, such as enumerating a list of tables in a
target collection (for example, ODBC Catalog SQLTables).

If this paramater is not specified (left blank), the driver or the provider uses
the default values depending on the platform that DB2 is running on. For DB2 (on
Mainframe), it defaults to SYSIBM, for DB2/400 it defaults to QSYS2, and for UDB
the default value is SYSCAT.

Retrieving all the tables within these global defaults could be time consuming
for the driver and the provider, therefore, it is recommended that you specify
the name of the target collection whenever possible.

Additional query words: AS/400 MVS OS/390
