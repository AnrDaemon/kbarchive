TITLE   :XADM: Error -1206 Starting Database
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the information store or directory, you may receive any of the
following error messages:

   -1206
   0xfffffb4a
   fffffb4a
   4294966090

All of the above are the same error, JET_errDatabaseCorrupted.

CAUSE
=====

This is a relatively generic error that occurs when the database engine is
unable to access critical information in the database file during database
startup. The database may not actually be damaged, but may be the wrong version
(for example, an Exchange Server 5.0 database runs against an Exchange Server
5.5 computer), or may be inaccessible because it is held open by another
process.

WORKAROUND
==========

Before concluding that the database is actually damaged, a full backup is always
recommended and further troubleshooting should be done to determine the cause of
the error.

Check for corresponding events in the application event log leading up to or
during the stop of the service. Such events may indicate a more precise cause of
the stop.
