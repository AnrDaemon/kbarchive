    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT

SYMPTOMS
========

If you change between standard time and daylight saving time in the Microsoft
Exchange Client, the date and time fields of every mail message may change one
hour forward or backward.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Client, Microsoft Schedule+, and related components are designed to
use the local file time-conversion utilities provided by the operating system.
Therefore, the time change behavior is dependent upon the operating system
settings.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION

You may want to consider upgrading to Microsoft Outlook, which does not exhibit
this behavior.
