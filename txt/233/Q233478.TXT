PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbservicepack kbRDO kbVS600sp2 kbVS600sp3fix kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message will display using Visual Basic 6 and RDO 2.0:

   "Object collection: couldn't find item indicated by text"

This will occur if you are using the RDO 2.0 version that shipped with Visual
Basic 6.0, and using the Microsoft Oracle ODBC Driver to pass Input or Output
parameters to a stored procedure within an Oracle package.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information
about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q194022 INFO: Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, What, Where, Why

MORE INFORMATION
================

After installing Visual Studio 6.0 SP3, the VB6 About screen should display
"Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 (SP3)" clearly. Previous Visual Basic 6 service
pack installations didn't display service pack versions in the About Screen. The
only way to tell if a service pack is installed was by checking some file
versions as described in the following article:

   Q194295 HOWTO: Tell That Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs Are Installed.
