SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses how to configure Exchange Server permissions to allow an
end user, like a secretary, to use the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator
program (Admin.exe) to create, modify, and delete mailboxes in the Recipients
container.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To configure an end user to be allowed to create mailboxes using the view-only
permissions in Exchange Server:

1. At the Site level, give the Windows NT account View-only Admin permissions.

2. At the Site's Recipients container, add the Windows NT account with Admin
   permissions under "Windows NT accounts with permissions."

To ensure the Permissions tab is visible for all objects in the Exchange Server
directory:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. Click the Permissions tab.

3. Click to select the "Show Permissions page for all objects" and "Display
   rights for roles on Permissions page" check boxes.

4. Click OK to close the dialog box.

For additional information, please refer to the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q161495 XADM: Setting Up Exchange View-Only Administrators

NOTE: An Exchange Server administrator with View-only permissions needs at a
minimum Account Operator permissions to create a new Windows NT Account. If the
administrator does not need to create new Windows NT accounts, Domain User
permissions are sufficient.
