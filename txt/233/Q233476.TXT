The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you compose a message offline using the offline Address Book, the message
may be sent to the wrong recipient. For example, User A sends an e-mail message
to User B and in the Sent Items folder, the mail may be shown as having been
sent to User C. When you check the properties for User C in the Sent Mail
folder, they are those of User D.

CAUSE
=====

When a name in a message is resolved from the Global Address List in an offline
Address Book, that name coincides with an entry ID in the Global Address List.
If address additions or modifications cause new X.500 address information or
SMTP domains in the online Address Book, the client offline Address Book
information may contain domain name offsets that do not match the server
offsets. Thus, the display name is right but the resolution is wrong, resulting
in a misrouted message.

RESOLUTION
==========

A combination client/server fix for this issue exists and must be deployed to
resolve this issue in the following manner:

1. Install Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2 on all the Exchange
   Server 5.5 computers. The service pack can be downloaded at:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/exchange/exchange-public/fixes/Eng/Exchg5.5/SP2/

2. Quit Outlook.

3. Apply the Archive Patch on each desktop computer. The patch can be downloaded
   at:

Outlook 98:

   http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/9798/arch98en.aspx

Outlook 97:

   http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/9798/arch97en.aspx

On the computers that use offline Address Books:

4. Delete all the offline Address Book files (all files ending in .oab).

5. Start Outlook.

6. Perform a complete offline Address Book download with full details.

The following files will be updated by the Archive Patch:
