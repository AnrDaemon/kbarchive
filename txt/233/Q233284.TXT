TITLE   :XADM: Event Service Causes Unwanted Public Folder Replication
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Scenario:

You perform a custom installation of two Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 computers
in two different sites with no event service, for example, ServerA in SiteA,
ServerB in SiteB. You set up directory replication with an X.400 Connector
between SiteA and SiteB. Then, you create a public folder on ServerA/SiteA and
replicate it to ServerB/SiteB.

Problem:

When you install Microsoft Exchange Event Service on ServerA/SiteA, the Exchange
Server Administrator program shows the replica of the system folder
EventsRoot\EventConfig_ServerA for ServerA/SiteB to ServerB/SiteB.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by the fact that the parent EventsRoot folder is treated
"specially" by the information store. If you start the Exchange Server
Administrator program on a brand new server and site and try to view this
special folder before replication from other servers and sites has occurred, a
new (local) replica of the parent EventsRoot folder will be added. Over time,
this parent folder may have a lot of servers in its replica list. Whenever a new
child EventConfig_XXX folder is created, it automatically inherits this replica
list.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

STATUS
======

version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.
