SUMMARY
=======

A client may not be successfully authenticated on a Windows NT 4.0 RAS server
using the Security Dynamics Secure Windows NT Domain Access system if the user's
SecurID user name and Windows NT user name do not match. The Security Dynamics
Secure Windows NT Domain Access system consists of the ACE/Server and a SecurID
authenticator. SecurID authenticators can be in many different form factors,
including smart cards, hand-held hardware tokens and key fobs, and software
tokens.

When this occurs, event ID 20100 is generated on the Windows NT Server that
attempted to authenticate the user:

   Event ID: 20100
   Source: Router
   Description: The user was authenticated as <user name 1> by the third
   party security host module but was authenticated as <user name 2> by
   the RAS security. The user has been disconnected.
