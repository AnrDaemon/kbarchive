TITLE   :WD97: Word Hangs with DocProperty "Characters" Field in Header
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word8 word97

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a DocProperty "Characters" field into the header or footer of a
document, Microsoft Word may stop responding, or you may notice the CPU usage is
at or near 100 percent.

NOTE: Inserting a DocProperty "Characters" field into the body of a document does
not cause Word to stop responding.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use a NumChars field to insert the number of
characters contained within the document into a header or footer.

For more information about the NumChars field, click the Office Assistant, type
"NumChars field" (without the quotation marks), click Search, and then click to
view "Field codes: NumChars field."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Microsoft Help is not installed on your computer, click the
