SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start Personal Interviewer in Microsoft Business Planner,
you may receive the following error message:

   Some components of the Wizard Engine are missing. Please reinstall Microsoft
   Business Planner by running Setup from Microsoft Office 2000 Disc 2.

When you click OK, this error message remains on the screen. If you click OK
again, you receive the following error message:

   There is not enough free space left on this disk. Free some space on this
   drive before continuing with the wizard.

If you click OK, the initial error message reappears on the screen, and you are
forced to click through the same series of error messages.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you specify a read-only path, such as a folder marked
with the read-only attribute or a CD-ROM drive, as the default file location for
Business Planner.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, set a folder that is not marked with the read-only
attribute as the default file location for Business Planner. To do this:

   There is not enough free space left on this disk...

   click the Close button in the upper-right corner of the error message dialog
   box.

2. On the Go menu, click Options.

3. In the Default File Location box, type the path to a folder that is not
   marked with the read-only attribute.
