TITLE   :XFOR: Migration Wizard Stops Processing Messages Too Soon
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Migration wizard stops migrating a user's files from a Lotus
cc:Mail post office before finishing all messages.

CAUSE
=====

The Export utility provided by Lotus creates entries that contain binary data in
the text file used to import the users messages. The binary data can
inadvertently contain bytes that have text equivalents.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Migration Wizard

+--------------------------+
| File name   | Version    | 
+--------------------------+
| Mlmig32.dll | 5.5.2611.0 | 
+--------------------------+


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3. Microsoft has created an updated version that can in many cases work
around the incorrect information in the text file provided by the Export
utility.
