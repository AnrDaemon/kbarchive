TITLE   :Business Planner: Data Lost After Low Disk Space Warning Appears

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Business Planner 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you enter data in a Microsoft Business Planner wizard, you may be warned
that insufficient hard disk space is available, and the data you entered may be
lost.

If you minimize Business Planner, increase the amount of available space on your
hard disk, and then return to the wizard, the data you entered in the wizard may
be lost.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if both of the following conditions are true:

 - You navigate to a page outside of the wizard, and then attempt to navigate
   back to the wizard.

 - Less than 50 megabytes (MB) of space is available on the hard disk on which
   Microsoft Windows is installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this issue from occurring, always maintain at least 50 MB of
available space on the hard disk on which Windows is installed. Windows requires
this disk space to provide virtual memory for both Windows and Windows-based
programs.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Business Planner.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although you are able to navigate back to the wizard after receiving the low
disk space warning, you are returned to the previous or the next step in the
wizard. You are unable to return to the data entry step until you increase the
amount of available space on your hard disk.
