SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft Encarta 98 on a Macintosh computer running Mac OS
System 8.5 or later, a duplicate AppleScript extension appears when you restart
the computer. This extension is superimposed by a red "X" and is not loaded.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because both Encarta 98 and the Macintosh operating system
install an extension named AppleScript.

Although the extension installed by Encarta is trademarked, the Macintosh
operating system does not recognize that the two extensions are identical. As a
result, the computer attempts to load both AppleScript extensions at startup,
causing the conflict described in the "Symptoms" section of this article.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, disable the trademarked AppleScript extension that is
installed by Encarta. To do this:

1. Click the Apple menu, point to Control Panels, and then click Extensions
   Manager.

2. Under Extensions, click to clear the check box next to the trademarked
   AppleScript extension.

   NOTE: The version of the trademarked AppleScript extension that is installed
   by Encarta is 1.1.

3. Click Restart.
