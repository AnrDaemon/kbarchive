SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses some third-party monitoring tools you can use to monitor
applications and ports.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT Load Balancing Service (WLBS) monitors cluster integrity using the
periodic exchange of heartbeats between cluster members. Heartbeat exchange
ensures the server is available on the network, but does not include any
checking at the port or application level.

You can use third-party monitoring tools to control cluster membership based on
content availability. Some tools allow a command to be executed after detecting
an application failure at a server. For example, if an application being load
balanced on a server fails, the monitoring tool could execute the following
command

   wlbs stop <IPaddress>:<HostID>

where IPaddress is the IP address for that cluster and HostID is the host ID or
dedicated IP address of that server.

For information about the command line syntax, type "wlbs" (without the quotation
marks) at an MS-DOS prompt.

Some examples of third-party tools that monitor cluster membership are listed in
the following table.
