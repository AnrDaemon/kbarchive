CD-ROM: Readme.txt Instructions For Decker Presentations May Not Work
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The steps presented in the Readme.txt for viewing the Decker Presentation Center
Video workshops from the companion CD-ROM may not work for all systems (notably
Windows 95, and possibly some NT 4.0 systems and Windows 2000 system).

On some systems, typing D:\Presentation Center in the Start-Run menu will return
the following error:

   cannot find the file 'd:\presentation' or one of its components

The instructions in the Readme.txt should be modified as follows:
3. Type "D:\Presentation Center" (where D is your CD-ROM drive letter) and press
the Enter key. The statement must be enclosed in quotation marks.
4. This will open a Windows Explorer window.

Note: The instructions presented in the book, pages xviii-xix, which are slightly
different, will work on all systems.


Pages 64-65: Add First Step and Renumber Steps Accordingly
----------------------------------------------------------

Add a new first step to the procedure "Collapse and Expand the Outline."

Add:
1. If necessary, on the View menu, point to Toolbars, and then click Outlining to
display the Outlining Toolbar.

Then renumber the rest of the current steps 1-7 to be steps 2-8.
