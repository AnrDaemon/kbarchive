TITLE   :XGEN: Using Windows2000 Encrypted File System to Encrypt Mdbdata
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you want to encrypt the Mdbdata folder with the Windows 2000 Encrypted File
system, you need to be logged on as the Exchange Server service account.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You must use the Exchange Server service account to encrypt the Mdbdata folder
or the information store will not start. You must use the service account
because this is the account which actually accesses the files within the Mdbdata
folder. Users actually interface with the Information Store Service to access
the Priv.edb, Pub.edb, and other files within the Mdbdata directory. The
Information Store Service uses the security context of the service account to
access the files.

You may notice that the Information Store Service starts more slowly than usual
after you apply the encryption because the files are being decrypted while the
Information Store Service starts. After the files are decrypted, they remain
decrypted as long as they are in use by the information store.

If you get the following error message while starting the information store, it
means that the file encryption attribute was not set using the service account.

   Windows could not start the Microsoft Exchange Information Store on Local
   Computer. For information, review the System Event Log. If this is a
   non-Microsoft service, contact the service vendor, and refer to
   service-specific error code -1032

You may also see the following errors in the application log when you try to
start the Information Store Service.

   Event ID 145 - MSExchangeIS((1856)) could not access the file called
   Exchsrvr\Mdbdata\Edb.chk
