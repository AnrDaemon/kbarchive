SYMPTOMS
========

When you close a Microsoft Excel template opened by an Excel wizard link in
Microsoft Business Planner without making changes to the template, you receive
the following message:

   Do you want to save the changes you made to <filename>? Microsoft Excel
   recalculates formulas when opening files last saved by an earlier version of
   Excel.

CAUSE

This behavior occurs because the Excel templates created for Business Planner
were created prior to the release of Microsoft Excel 2000.

MORE INFORMATION

   Do you want to save the changes you made to <filename>? Microsoft Excel
   recalculates formulas when opening files last saved by an earlier version of
   Excel.
