TITLE   :XFOR: Notes Connector Event ID 1: DXANOTES Failed to Initialize
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5, after you start the Exchange Connector
for Lotus Notes service, Event ID 1 is constantly logged in the Event Viewer
application log. Some of these events include the following description:

   LME-NOTES-DXANOTES(020d)1 64002:error[Invalid configuration:failed to
   initialize notes directory exchange agent].

-or-

   Default queue route of Q does not exist.

If directory synchronization between Exchange Server and Lotus Notes is
configured, it does not work, but mail flow functions correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The Q directory is missing for %Exchsrvr%\Connect\Exchconn.

RESOLUTION
==========

Open Windows NT Explorer and create the directory %Exchsrvr%\Connect\Exchconn
\Q.

As soon as you create the directory, the Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes
service will automatically create the following Q subdirectories:

   Archive
   Badmif
   Dxamex.in
   DXAmex.out

Restart the Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes service, and the Application Log
events should stop, and directory replication will resume.
