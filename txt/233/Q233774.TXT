TITLE   :Access Violation Using Component Builder's Import COBOL Wizard
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsna400sp2

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 4.0 SP2 
 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You receive the following access violations when you use the Import COBOL wizard
of the COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS (COMTI) Component Builder
(CB).

   The instruction at "0x6c117061" referenced memory at "0x00000000". The memory
   could not be "read".

   -and-

   'Unhandled exception in ComponentBuilder.exe (DTCOB390.DLL): 0xC0000005:
   Access Violation.

CAUSE
=====

The COBOL program used for processing with the wizard is incomplete. It contains
statements belonging to the program's WORKING-STORAGE SECTION followed by a
LINKAGE SECTION statement, an 01 DFHCOMMAREA statement, and finally, a PROCEDURE
DIVISION statement and PROCEDURE DIVISION contents. However, the WORKING-STORAGE
SECTION contents are not preceded by a WORKING-STORAGE SECTION statement.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the entire COBOL program source with the wizard or use a text editor to
remove all the COBOL statements contained in the source that are not required
for defining the COMTI component library. Start the CB, and use the modified
COBOL source with the wizard.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0
Service Pack 2.
