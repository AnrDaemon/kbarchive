TITLE   :NET SEND <MyComputer> May Not Work with Disabled Network Adapter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you have a computer with two network interface cards in it, and you use a
hardware profile to boot the computer with one of the interfaces disabled, you
may not be able to run a "NET SEND" (without the quotation marks) command to the
local computername.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Netbt.sys driver maintains an internal name
table, visible using the "nbtstat -n" (without the quotation marks) command.
When you run a "NET SEND" (without the quotation marks) command to the local
computername, Service Pack 4's Netbt.sys file used the first name/address
mapping in the local name table, without validating it to make sure it was a
legitimate address.

RESOLUTION
==========

NetBT has been fixed to check for a valid (non-zero) IP address when looking up
an IP address in the local name table.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or the
