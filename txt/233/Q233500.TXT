The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

There are known year 2000 issues for IBM PS/1 ValuePoint computers that have
Windows NT 4.0 installed. To fix these known issues, you must upgrade the
Ntdetect.com file in order to resolve known year 2000 issues in older versions
of the file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In previous service packs, the Ntdetect.com file is located in a separate Ps1
folder. In Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5 (SP5), the Ntdetect.com file is now
located in the i386 and Alpha folders that contains this fix. The Ps1 folder no
longer exists in the SP5 folder structure.

Installing SP5 updates the Ntdetect.com file on your computer. Alternatively, you
can copy the Ntdetect.com file from the CD to your computer's primary boot
partition. You do not need to restart your computer for the change to take
effect.
