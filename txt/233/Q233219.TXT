KEYWORDS:exc55

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install the Internet Mail Service on an Exchange Server
computer, the following error message may be displayed:

   Self registration of the DLL c:\winnt\system32\inetcomm.dll failed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Manually register the Inetcomm.dll file located on your hard disk. To do so,
   click Start, click Run, type "regsvr32 c:\winnt\system32\inetcomm.dll"
   (without the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

2. Restart the computer, and then attempt to install the Internet Mail Service
   again.

If the problem still occurs, you may need to replace the Inetcomm.dll file on
your hard disk with the version of the file on the Exchange Server 5.5 CD-ROM.
To do so:

1. Rename the Inetcomm.dll file in the Winnt\System32 folder on your hard disk
   to Inetcomm.old.

2. Copy the Inetcomm.dll file from the Exchange Server 5.5 CD-ROM to the
   Winnt\System32 folder on your hard disk.

3. Manually register the Inetcomm.dll file as described above, restart the
   computer, and then attempt to install the Internet Mail Service again.
