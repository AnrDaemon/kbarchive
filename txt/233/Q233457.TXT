SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to print selected rows from a table in Microsoft Business
Planner, you may experience one of the following symptoms:

 - If you select one row of the table, an empty, shaded area may be printed
   instead of the selected row.

 - If you select two or more rows of the table, you may receive two copies of
   the printout.

   NOTE: The first copy of the printout is printed properly. The second copy of
   the printout is shifted to the left margin of the page, and some columns may
   be missing or truncated.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue:

1. Select two or more rows of the table.

2. On the File menu, click Print.

3. Under Page Range, click Selection, and then click Print.

4. Discard the second copy of the printout.

STATUS
======
