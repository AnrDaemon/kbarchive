TITLE   :Cannot Retrieve UserName Property in Windows Script Host
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbProgramming kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to retrieve the UserName property using the WScript.Network
object in a Windows 95/98 logon script, you receive a null value. In some cases
you may also receive an error code of 800704DD.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because a Windows 95/98 logon script is run before the logon
process is complete.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, use a While loop to continue to retrieve the value as
long as it remains null.

The following VBScript code is a sample of how to implement the workaround.

   On Error Resume Next
   Dim strUserName
   Set WSHNetwork = CreateObject("WScript.Network")
   While strUserName = ""
       strUserName = WSHNetwork.UserName
   WEnd
