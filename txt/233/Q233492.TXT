SUMMARY
=======

This articles discusses some major differences between Network File System (NFS)
version 2 and version 3.

NFS Version 2 is documented in RFC 1094 and was published in March 1989. NFS
Version 3 is documented in RFC 1813 and was published in June 1995.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: Services for Unix 2.0 supports both NFS versions 2 and 3.

The major differences between the NFS versions 2 and 3 are:

 - Version 2 of the NFS protocol limited file offsets to a 32-bit quantity,
   which limited the size of files accessible by clients to 4.2 GB. For users
   who regularly gain access to larger files, this was a severe limitation. NFS
   version 3 extended the file offsets and a number of other fields to 64-bits.

 - NFS Version 2 limited the data transfer size to 8 KB. No single read or write
   request could exceed 8 KB. This limits performance on high-bandwidth networks
   because it artificially increases the number of NFS requests to transfer a
   given amount of data. NFS version 3 removed that limitation and allows the
   client and server to negotiate a maximum transfer size.

 - Version 2 NFS servers must commit data written by a client to stable storage
   (a disk or NVRAM) before responding affirmatively to the client.

 - NFS version 3 provides a new COMMIT operation that allows a client to perform
   unstable writes to a server followed by a COMMIT request. The server is
   required to verify that client data is on stable storage only when it
   receives the COMMIT operation. A mechanism is provided that allows the client
   to detect server loss of uncommitted data and recover.
