SUMMARY
=======

In IIS 4.0, the SSIEnableCmdDirective registry property is set to TRUE by
default. However, in IIS version 5.0, the default value of the
SSIEnableCmdDirective registry property is set to FALSE. This value is set to
FALSE to prevent running unauthorized server-side executables.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To set the value to TRUE or enable the SSI CMD directive, follow these steps:

1. Start the Registry Editor (Regedit.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3SVC\Parameters

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. On the Edit menu, click New, and then DWORD Value.

4. Specify "SSIEnableCmdDirective" (without the quotation marks) for the name.

5. Specify "1" (without the quotation marks) for the value.

6. Close the Registry Editor.

7. Restart IIS.
