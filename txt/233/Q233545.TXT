KEYWORDS:kbsms120 kbsms120bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you take Remote Control of a Windows NT Workstation computer from another
computer that is running Windows NT, the UDP packets appear to get out of
synchronization. After a few minutes, the client no longer receives input from
the administrator. The administrator can still see the client mouse and keyboard
input, but can no longer update the client. The administrator keyboard and mouse
are non functional at that point.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Systems Management Server service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services

support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
