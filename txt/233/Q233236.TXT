SYMPTOMS
========

Messages sent from Microsoft Mail to Exchange Server through the MS Mail
Connector Interchange (MSMI) using a Chinese Outlook client are not delivered to
their destination. The sender receives a non-delivery report (NDR) similar to
the following:

   

   Your Message
  	  To:   <somebody@microsoft.com>
     Subject:   Test Message From Chinese Outlook/MSMail

   Was not delivered for the following reasons:

     Delivery failed to MS:MICROSOFT/SITE/SOMEBODY
     Reason: 0 (transfer failed)
     diagnostic: -1 (no diagnostic).
     MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:SITE:SERVER.

   Original message body follows...

The following events are logged in the event log:

   PDU dump reference 5 [MTA SUBMIT 17 74] (14)

   Event ID: 290
   Source: MSExchangeMTA
   Description:
   A non-delivery report (reason code transfer-failure and diagnostic code Omit
   any diagnostic code) is being generated for message C=US;A=
   ;P=Microsoft;L=MICROSOFT-SITE-00000287. It was originally destined for
   DN:/o=Microsoft/ou=SITE/cn=Recipients/cn=Somebody§ (recipient number 1), and
   was to be redirected to . [MTA DISP:RESULT 20 136] (12)

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the Microsoft Exchange Server information store
receives the message from the message transfer agent (MTA) and detects that
there are two MAPI Properties for strings within the message that have
conflicting code page IDs. The information store sends an NDR for the message
because of the discrepancy.

This problem will not occur if the Chinese Exchange client is used instead of the
Chinese Outlook client because the Chinese Outlook client includes four
additional MAPI Properties for the TNEF portion of the message, one of which is
an additional string property containing a code page ID.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
