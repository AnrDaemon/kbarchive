======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Systems Management Server version 2.0 does not communicate with Novell NetWare
version 5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Systems Management Server version 2.0 supports interaction with servers running
Novell NetWare versions 3.x and 4.x in bindery and NDS mode. Systems Management
Server version 2.0 and 2.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1) do not successfully communicate
with servers running Novell NetWare version 5.

Also, you cannot communicate with servers running NetWare versions 3.x or 4.x
that are part of the NetWare 5 tree. This occurs because when you install
NetWare 5 into an existing NetWare 4.x NDS tree, the NetWare 5 server takes
ownership of the master copy of the NDS database. When NetWare 5 converts the
NDS database, it adds extensions to the NDS tree to which Systems Management
Server 2.0 cannot connect.

When Systems Management Server version 2.0 attempts to create a client access
point (CAP) or distribution point on a NetWare 5 server it cannot authenticate
the tree. This occurs even if your credentials are valid.

For more information about integration with NetWare and supported redirectors,
please review the Microsoft Systems Management Server Version 1.2 and 2.0
Interoperability white paper at the following Microsoft Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/smsmgmt/deployment/

Please review the release notes from later service packs for any additional
supported redirectors.

New Support for NetWare 5 Integration with Systems Management Server 2.0 SP2:

Refer to the Readme_operations.htm file that comes on the Systems Management
Server 2.0 SP2 image. Later service packs may change the requirement for the
supported redirector. Refer to the Readme_operations.htm or Readme.htm file that
is supplied with each service pack for changes to supportability.

Systems Management Server 2.0 SP2 adds the following NetWare support:

Systems Management Server 2.0 SP2 site servers can use the Novell intraNetWare
Client for NT 4.7 to communicate with site systems running NetWare 4.x or 5.x.
See Known Issues Regarding Novell NetWare Client v4.7 for Windows NT/2000 for
issues with using the Novell 4.7 redirector.
