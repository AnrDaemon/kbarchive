PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

An Exchange Client or Outlook client may receive an e-mail message that contains
a sent time that matches the received time, even if the e-mail message was sent
several minutes or hours before the message was received.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This behavior does not occur if you use
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem only occurs when the following conditions exist:

 - The Outlook client has two profiles set up, one for Internet mail and one for
   Exchange Server mail.

 - The Internet mail profile is set to receive mail from a UNIX-based server by
   using the Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) protocol.

 - The Outlook client is set to deliver incoming mail to an Exchange Server
   version 5.0 mailbox. If the Outlook client is set to deliver incoming mail to
   a personal folder file (.pst), the sent and received times may be correct.
