When you start Workgroup Mail for the first time and choose to set up
your own account, the default account name is the same name you used
when installing Windows for Workgroups version 3.1.

Workgroup Mail in Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 reads the
customer name information from the USER.EXE file located in the
WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory for the default account name.

The account name can be changed during the setup process of
Workgroup Mail.
