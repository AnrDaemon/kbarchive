MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start Visual Basic or from the File menu, choose New Project (ALT, F, N) if
   Visual Basic is already running. Form1 is created by default.

2. From the File menu, choose Add File (ALT F, A), and add MSMASKED.VBX to your
   project.

3. Place a Masked Edit control (MaskedEdit1) on Form1.

4. Set the BorderStyle Property of MaskedEdit1 to 0 - None.

5. From the Run menu, choose start (ALT, R, S), or press the F5 key to run the
   program.

6. Visual Basic will generate an "Invalid Property Value" error. Click OK in the
   error message to return to Visual Basic.

7. Set the Mask Property of MaskedEdit1 to #### and set the BorderStyle Property
   back to 1 - Single.

8. Now check the Mask Property. It contains unusual characters, but it should
   still contain ####.
