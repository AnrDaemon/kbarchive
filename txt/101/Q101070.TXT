In order for the title of your custom Microsoft Access application to
appear in the Microsoft Windows Task List, you need to provide a Title
Bar setting in the application's .INI file. The setting should be
included in the [Run-Time Options] section of the .INI file and should
have the following format:

   [Run-Time Options]
   TitleBar=<MyApplicationName>

Substitute the name of your custom application for <MyApplicationName>
in the example above.

Restart your custom application after making this change to the .INI
file. The application's name will appear in the Task List.

Additional query words: nxml
