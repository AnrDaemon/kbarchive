The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to delete a directory and all of its files succeeds, even when you
have only Read permission to access the files.

CAUSE
=====

If you have Full Control permission for a directory, you have an implied
FILE_DELETE_CHILD permission. This permission enables you to delete a directory
and all the files it contains (its children), even if the files are read-only.

RESOLUTION
==========

To remove file delete privileges, remove Full Control privilege from the
directory, and grant each privilege in the Other field of the Special Access
menu.
