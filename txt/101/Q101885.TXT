Microsoft Backup for MS-DOS (MSBACKUP.EXE) fails to restore files to a different
machine than the one you originally used for backup. Attempting to restore using

menu program. To work around this problem, exit Microsoft Backup and the menu
program and then run Microsoft Backup from an MS-DOS command prompt.

3. Select the correct drive letter from which to rebuild and then choose OK.

4. After rebuilding, choose the Load button to load the new file, then continue
   with Restore.
