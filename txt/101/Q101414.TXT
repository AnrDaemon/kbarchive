TITLE   :BUG: OpenFile() Fails When UNC Name Longer Than 11 Characters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonlykbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

OpenFile() successfully opens files with universal naming convention (UNC) names
when the server portion of the name is 11 characters or shorter, but fails to
open files when the server name is longer than 11 characters. Error code number
2, "File not found," is placed in the nErrCode member of the OFSTRUCT structure
passed to OpenFile.

CAUSE
=====

OpenFile() validates filenames before opening them, and in the case of UNC
names, allows server names that are 11 characters or shorter only. No attempt is
made to open a file with a UNC name longer than 11 characters.

RESOLUTION
==========

To open files with UNC names when the server name is longer than 11 characters,
use _lopen().

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Windows SDK versions 3.1 and
3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

This is not a problem under Windows NT WOW or under Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem also affects the File Open common dialog box, because
GetOpenFileName() calls OpenFile().
