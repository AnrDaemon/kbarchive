SYMPTOMS
========

When using multiple configurations, the MENUDEFAULT timer option does not work
for submenus if the timer for the top-level menu is interrupted. This operation
is by design.

The MENUDEFAULT timer is designed to give you a certain amount of time to select
a configuration of your choice. If you do not respond within the allotted time
period, the assigned default configuration is executed. However, if you select a
submenu before the timer reaches zero, the timer for the submenu is not
available.

NOTE: The MENUDEFAULT timer can be put under the submenu options. This gives you
an additional timer count for the new MENUDEFAULT choice.

Additional query words: 6.22 6.00 menu multi config multiconfig 6.20
