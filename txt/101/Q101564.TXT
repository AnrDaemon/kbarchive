TITLE   :Stacked Floppy Disk Drives Interfere with Stacker Conversion
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

DoubleSpace may be unable to convert a Stacker 3.0-compressed hard disk drive if
a floppy disk drive is identified as a Stacker- compressed drive in the
CONFIG.SYS file. In this case, the following error messages may occur when you
run the Stacker conversion:

 - Drive A: is not a Stacker drive.

 - DoubleSpace was not able to convert your Stacker drives to DoubleSpace
   format.

Because the conversion was unsuccessful, Stacker remains installed on your
system. Press ENTER to reboot your computer and reenable Stacker.

CAUSE
=====

These errors occur if you identify a floppy disk drive on the Stacker device
line in your CONFIG.SYS file. For example:

      device=c:\stacker\stacker.com c:\stacvol.dsk a:

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, remove the reference to your floppy disk drive from the
Stacker device line in your CONFIG.SYS file. For example:

      device=c:\stacker\stacker.com c:\stackvol.dsk

Now, run the Stacker conversion again.
