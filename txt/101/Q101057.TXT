TITLE   :PRB: "Variable Not Found" or Public Variables Acting Private

KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for Macintosh, version 2.01 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Adding memory variables to a report, or changing the scope of memory variables
from private to public after a report is created, can cause a variety of
problems in FoxBASE+/Mac, including the following:

 - Issuing a "Report Form XXX" command returns the error message

   Variable not found

   when you are using a report created with public memory variables.

 - Variables in a user-defined function (UDF) that were originally defined as
   private may still function as private variables after the UDF is changed to
   declare the variables as public.

CAUSE
=====

When a report and environment is initially saved in FoxBASE+/Mac, a view file is
created. The view file contains the memory variables currently defined in memory
at the time the report is initially saved.

Subsequent modifications to the defined memory variables are not saved in the
view file, even if the environment is cleared and resaved. When the report form
is printed, the view file restores memory to the state initially saved with the
report. A variety of problems can occur, including memory variables appearing to
be missing or being defined with an incorrect scope.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following steps will resolve problems related to the view file:


1. From the File menu, choose Open and select the report form. This will restore
   memory to the state originally saved with the view file.

2. Switch to the Command window. Make any necessary modifications to memory
   variables (such as declaring new variables or releasing private memory
   variables and declaring them as public).

3. Switch to the View window. From the File menu, choose Save, and save the view
   with the same name as the report.
