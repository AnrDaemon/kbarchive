SUMMARY
=======

This article provides instructions to manually install Microsoft Musical
Instruments version 1.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

These instructions assume:

 - Your hard disk is drive C

 - Your destination folder is C:\Msinstr

 - Your Windows folder is C:\Windows

 - Your CD-ROM drive is drive D

If your hard disk drive, destination folder, Windows folder, or CD-ROM drive
letters are different, replace the drive letters and folder names throughout
this article with the drive letters and folder names on your computer.

NOTE: The following instructions discuss copying, editing, and modifying folders
and files. For more information about accomplishing these tasks in Windows, see
your Windows printed documentation or online Help.

1. Create a folder named Msinstr on the hard drive (C:\Msinstr).

   For example, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER
   at the end of the line:

   "md c:\msinstr" (without the quotation marks)

2. Copy all files in the D:\Bin folder to the C:\Msinstr folder. The files are:

   - Mi.hlp
   - Msinstr.exe
   - Msinstr.the

   For example, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER:

   "copy d:\bin\*.* c:\msinstr" (without the quotation marks)

   NOTE: On later versions (9/93) of Musical Instruments, the Bin folder has been
   replaced with the Xfiles folder. If your CD-ROM has a Xfiles folder,
   substitue Xfiles for Bin in this step.

3. Copy Readme.txt from the D:\ folder to C:\Msinstr.

4. If you are using Windows 3.1x, copy the following files from D:\Drivers to
   C:\Windows\System:

   - Msacm.drv
   - Msadpcm.acm

   NOTE: Do not perform this step if you are using Windows 95 or Windows NT.
   Allowing system files to be overwritten in Windows 95 or Windows NT may cause
   improper system performance.

5. Use a text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad, to make the following changes
   to the Msinstr.ini file, which is located in the Windows folder. If the
   Msinstr.ini file does not already exist, create one in the Windows folder
   with these entries:

         [Music]
         CD=D:
         Command=C:\msinstr\msinstr.the
         Window=62,24

6. Use a text editor to make the following changes to this Windows
   initialization file, which is located in the Windows folder:

   Changes to the System.ini File

         [Drivers]
         wavemapper=msacm.drv
