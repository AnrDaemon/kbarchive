OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Inbox Shadowing is not recommended when using version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
Remote for Windows because of possible problems accessing the same mailbox as
the one being used by Microsoft Mail for Windows.

NOTE: For more information on Inbox Shadowing, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q96718 PC Win: Description and Use of Inbox Shadowing

CAUSE
=====

The Windows client is the controlling client. Therefore, if you delete messages
with another client such as Mail Remote for Windows or Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks, MS-DOS workstation, the Windows client does not reflect the
deletions.

For example, after you delete a message with Mail Remote for Windows or the
MS-DOS client, the inbox shows 85 headers or messages.

However, when you run the Windows client, it tells you that there are 127
messages in the Inbox.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
