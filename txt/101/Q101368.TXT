-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.2 
 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: MS-DOS 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows and Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation, implement private folder storage
in different ways. The Windows client stores private folders in the
Mail message file (.MMF) and the MS-DOS client stores folders in the
.FLD files within the postoffice database structure.

It is best for users who use both the MS-DOS and Windows clients to
use private folders in only one of the clients. However, a workaround
exists if private folder access is required from both clients.
 
 
The following are the steps to the workaround:

NOTE: A side effect of this workaround is that the group will now
appear in the postoffice address list as well as the global address
list on the postoffice where the group resides. Use this workaround
with discretion.
 

1. Sign on to the Administrator program as Admin and select Local-Admin, Modify
   to grant group folder privileges to the user who requires private folder
   access from both clients.

2. Select Local-Admin, Group, Create to create a global group specifying the
   sole member of the group as the user who requires private folder access from
   both clients.

   NOTE: DO NOT include the group in directory synchronization.

3. Sign on to the MS-DOS client as that user. Select Options, Folders, Create to
   create a group folder for that group. Make sure you specify the folder mode
   to Group.

   NOTE: Group folders can only be created in the MS-DOS client.

Because the individual is the only person who has access to the group
folder, the folder now behaves like a private folder. The
administrator must be careful not to assign additional members who
also have group folder privileges to the group.

The group folder is stored in a .FLD file that can only be accessed by
the Windows client when it is connected to the postoffice. This folder
is not accessible when working offline.

In the Windows client, all group folders appear in the shared folder
panel. The group folder will NOT appear in the private folder panel.

NOTE: Group folder access was not available in the Windows client in
versions earlier than 3.0b.
