-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Not having a LastDrive statement in the CONFIG.SYS file or setting the LastDrive
statement to a "low" (that is, alphabetically early) drive letter (such as E)
limits the number of network drive connections available when you are using
Microsoft LAN Manager version 2.0, 2.1, or 2.2 and Novell NetWare (when you are
using a monolithic workstation redirector [NETX.COM or NETX.EXE]).

MORE INFORMATION
================

LAN Manager Versions 2.0 and 2.1
--------------------------------

If the LastDrive statement in the CONFIG.SYS file is not present, LastDrive is
set to a default of E. If drive E is being used by a physical partition or for
some other purpose, the default LastDrive setting needs to be increased.

If LastDrive is set to a low drive letter and all drive letters become used,
Windows may hang at startup or may display the error message "Cannot read from
drive x:."

LAN Manager Version 2.2
-----------------------

If the LastDrive statement in the CONFIG.SYS file is not present, LAN Manager
sets LastDrive to E by default unless the last physical partition on the local
drive is greater than E; in that scenario, LastDrive is set to the letter value
of the last physical partition on the local drive. Once the number of drives in
use equals the letter value of LastDrive, LastDrive does not allow connections
to additional drive letters. This limitation of available drives also occurs if
the LastDrive statement is set to a low drive letter and all the network drives
are in use.

When all network drives are in use, File Manager does not allow additional
network drive connections. Usually, the Drive Letter box automatically
increments to the next available drive letter. However, if all network drives
are in use, the Drive Letter box remains blank because no more network drive
letters are available.

To correct this problem, edit the LastDrive statement in the CONFIG.SYS file so
that it reads "LastDrive=Z" (without the quotation marks) and then restart your
computer.

Now, when you connect to a new network drive the Drive Letter box should
increment to the next available drive letter.

Novell NetWare Using a Monolithic Workstation Redirector
--------------------------------------------------------

Novell NETX.COM and NETX.EXE use the LastDrive statement to determine at which
drive letter network drives are available. For example, if LastDrive=Z, then it
is impossible to log on to Novell.

To correct this problem, edit the LastDrive statement in the CONFIG.SYS file so
that it uses the last physical drive on the local workstation and then restart
your computer.

This should allow you to log on to the Novell server successfully.
