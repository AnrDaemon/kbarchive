PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, with the option Connect on
Exit of Mail selected, the following incorrect error message may appear if you
do not have mail to send in your Outbox when you exit:

   This Microsoft Mail Remote driver is not compatible with your messaging
   system.

This message is incorrect and misleading.

If you have mail waiting in your Outbox, this error message does not appear.

This problem is also documented in the README.TXT file under section 2J. The
README.TXT file is located on Disk 1.

NOTE: To find the Connect on Exis option, click Session Setup on the Mail menu.
Then slect Connection Times.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
Remote for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If there is mail in the Outbox, the error message does not appear. Instead, this
message appears:

   There is unsent mail in your Outbox. Do you wish to send it?

If you select Yes, the connection occurs and mail exits. If you select No, Mail
exits with no error message. This behavior is the same whether or not the
Connect At Exit option has been selected.

If you are using the Microsoft Mail System Selector and have an active mail
session in which you have selected the Connect On Exit Of Mail option, the
selector appears to stop responding to mouse input after the incorrect error
message appears. If you select OK with the keyboard (by pressing the ENTER key),
the selector closes as it should.
