-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Server Manager from Windows NT Advanced Server, one of the
following error messages may appear when you double-click a workstation:

   Server Manager Access is denied.

   -or-

   Server Manager
   The computer WFW_COMPUTER_NAME is not configured for remote administration.

CAUSE
=====

This error message is due to having a workgroup and a domain on the network with
the same name. When this situation exists, the workgroup computers will appear
on the domain as a workstation under Server Manager. However, they are not
members of the domain and cannot be administered from the server on the domain.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, you can either rename the domain or the Windows NT
workgroup or the Windows for Workgroups workgroup.
