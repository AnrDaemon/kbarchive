======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may be unable to access the Corel LS2000 SCSI device after upgrading to
MS-DOS.

CAUSE
=====

Corel Technical Support has confirmed that the device drivers typically used to
access the LS2000 SCSI drive cannot automatically locate the address range at
which the device's adapter ROM resides. This problem does not occur with
previous versions of MS-DOS.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, specify the address range used by the LS2000 when
you load the SCSI device drivers in the CONFIG.SYS file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

CUNI_LS2.SYS
------------

If you try to load CUNI_LS2.SYS with MS-DOS 6.0, you may receive the following
error message:

   Corel LS2000 SCSI host adapter not found. Host adapter support code not
   installed.

When the computer has finished booting, the SCSI device is not accessible. To
work around this problem, you must specify the address range that the device
uses. Using the following syntax, add the /MEM switch to the line in the
CONFIG.SYS file that loads CUNI_LS2.SYS

      DEVICE=<drive><path>CUNI_LS2.SYS /MEM:<;xxxx-xxxx>

where <xxx-xxxx> represents the entire address range at which the device is
located. The default for this range is D800-DBFF, however, it can be changed
using hardware switches.

CUNIASP.SYS
-----------

If you try to load CUNIASP.SYS, no error message occurs, but the SCSI device is
still inaccessible.

To specify the address range while using CUNIASP.SYS, an additional device driver
must be loaded. The device driver ASPLS_D.SYS should be loaded immediately
before CUNIASP.SYS in the CONFIG.SYS file and should have the following syntax

      DEVICE=<drive><path>ASPLS_D.SYS /LS2000,<xxxx>,3

where <xxxx> represents the starting address used by the LS2000. The
default starting address is D800.

For more information on the above device drivers and the LS2000 SCSI device, call
Corel Technical Support.
