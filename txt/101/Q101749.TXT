The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Administrator program for versions 2.1, 3.0, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks compresses the mailbags (.MBG files) that belong to
external postoffices and gateways. The Compress Mailbag utility is selected
by selecting Local-Admin, Storage, Compress.

This utility compresses all mailbags on the postoffice. The function does
not distinguish between a user's mailbag on the postoffice, an external
postoffice mailbag, or a gateway mailbag. This could cause problems if an
external postoffice or a gateway is active.

The purpose of the Compress utility is to recover space from the system
mailbags. The mailbags contain the headers for the mail items for the owner
of the mailbag. Even though the user deletes the mail item, the header
remains in the mailbag and is marked deleted. As a result, the mailbag
still takes up the same amount of space. The Compress utility recovers this
space.

The Compress utility of Administrator program opens the .KEY and .MBG files
with READ, WRITE and DENY_WRITE file permissions. If there is an External
or Gateway active, the file can still be read and this causes the External
or Gateway to get data that is out of date.

For more information on the Compress utility, please see the "Managing the
Mail System Disk Storage Space" section of the "Administrator's Guide."
