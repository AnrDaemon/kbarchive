The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ServerPath entry in the [Microsoft Mail] section of the MSMAIL.INI
file enables versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows to
search for the postoffice in the specified directory. This eliminates
the need for the NetWare workstation to have a specific drive letter
mapped to the Microsoft Mail postoffice.

There are two required entries in the [Microsoft Mail] section to make
this work on a NetWare 2.x or 3.x server:

      ServerPath=server/volume:path
      ServerPassword=
      (no parameter is required on the ServerPassword line)

In the MSMAIL.INI file (found in the subdirectory where Windows is
installed) add the following lines in the [Microsoft Mail] section:

      ServerPath=server/volume:path
      ServerPassword=
      (no parameter is required on the ServerPassword line)

After logging in to the NetWare server, when the user starts Microsoft
Mail, Mail dynamically connects to the postoffice using an unused
drive letter to the NetWare file server where the postoffice resides.
There is no need to establish a drive mapping to the postoffice in a
NetWare login script.

The ServerPassword entry is used to connect to the server specified by
the ServerPath entry. Because the user will have already specified a
password when logging in, Mail interprets the ServerPassword line as
having entered a password.
