TITLE   :Unable to Close MSD Button Option Using Keyboard

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot close a main "button" option in the Microsoft Diagnostic Utility
(MSD.EXE) after you choose a command from the File, Utilities, or Help menus if
the option's window is displayed on the screen.

If you press ENTER to close the window or press F3 to exit MSD, there is no
response (although the keyboard may appear to stop responding [hang]).

WORKAROUND
==========

Exit the window by choosing OK with the mouse, or exit MSD by using the ALT+F+X
(ALT+File+Exit) key combination. You cannot close the button option by pressing
ENTER, and you cannot exit MSD.EXE by pressing F3; these keyboard commands do
not work.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MSD button options include Computer, Memory, Video, Network, OS Version,
Mouse, Other Adapters, Disk Drives, LPT Ports, COM Ports, IRQ Status, TSR
Programs, and Device Drivers.

NOTE: You may experience this problem in any button option windows.

3.1 and 3.11), version 2.0a (which ships with Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
