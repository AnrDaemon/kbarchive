In FoxPro for MS-DOS, you can use the Color command on the Screen menu to
specify colors for screen objects. However, this command is not available in
FoxPro for Windows.

FoxPro 2.x for Windows
----------------------

To specify colors in FoxPro 2.x for Windows, select the screen object or a group
of objects. To modify the background color of the object(s), choose Fill Color
from the Object menu. To modify the outline and text of the object(s), choose
Pen Color from the Object menu.

NOTE: The Automatic setting will match the Windows color sets from the Control
Panel.

To change the background of the entire screen, choose Layout from the Screen
menu, and choose the Color button. You can either select a specific color or

.BMP file.
