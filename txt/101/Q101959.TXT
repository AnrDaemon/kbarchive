TITLE   :NETX.EXE and LOADHIGH in Remote Boot Configuration
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using Novell's NETX.EXE workstation shell in a remote boot
configuration and you use the MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2 LOADHIGH /L:x,yyyy syntax, you
may receive the following error message when NETX loads:

   Insert disk with \COMMAND.COM in drive A
   Press any key to continue...

Even if you insert a disk with COMMAND.COM in drive A and press a key, you cannot
get past this message.

CAUSE
=====

This situation occurs because the drive being referenced is the virtual drive A
established by the remote boot procedure. The extra syntax available to use with
MS-DOS 6.0 adn 6.2 is also related to this problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, you must eliminate the /L syntax from both the remote
boot image and the matching AUTOEXEC.BAT file in your login or home directory.

For example, if your remote boot image and matching AUTOEXEC.BAT file contain the
"LH /L:0 NETX.EXE" command, eliminate the /L:0 portion of the command so that
you are left with "LH NETX.EXE."

Once you re-create the remote boot image (typically NET$DOS.SYS), you should be
able to successfully boot without receiving the message mentioned above.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information on the LOADHIGH /L syntax, type "help loadhigh" (without
the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.
