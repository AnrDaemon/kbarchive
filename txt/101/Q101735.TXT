SUMMARY
=======

The PostScript printer driver for Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups 3.1
(PSCRIPT.DRV) versions 3.50 to 3.56 provide two paper choice options: Letter 8.5
x 11 and Note 8.5 x 11. These options are identical.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With Windows versions earlier than 3.1, each paper size required a unique,
predefined identification value. To create a Windows printer driver for a
PostScript printer, the Microsoft Windows Device Development Kit (DDK) utility
called MKPRN is used. If two or more paper sizes have the same dimensions, MKPRN
either ignores the duplicate or maps it to a unique, predefined paper size. In
the case of the PostScript printer driver, the paper sizes Letter 8.5 x 11 and
Note 8.5 x 11 were mapped to different paper sizes with the same dimensions.
