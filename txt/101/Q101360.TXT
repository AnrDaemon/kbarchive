TITLE   :MS-DOS Err Msg: DoubleSpace Has Used All the Memory...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:msdos

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to create or mount a DoubleSpace drive, you may receive the
following error message:

   DoubleSpace has used all the memory reserved by the settings in the Options
   dialog box. To enable DoubleSpace to allocate more memory, you should restart
   your computer now.

   Do you want to restart your computer now?

Under MS-DOS 6.22 you may receive the following error message:

   Not enough MEMORY to allocate more drives for Dblspace or Drvspace need to
   reboot and quit other applications?

Restarting your computer does not help--you still cannot mount more the drive.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs if you try to compress or mount more drives than are specified
by the Number of Removable-Media Drives setting in the DoubleSpace Options
dialog box, or if the total number of mounted drives is greater than 15.

The Number of Removable-Media Drives setting specifies how much memory
DoubleSpace reserves for mounting additional compressed drives after startup. If
you try to mount or create more compressed drives than DoubleSpace has reserved
memory for, you receive the above error message.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can adjust the Number of Removable-Media Drives setting by running
DoubleSpace, choosing Options from the Tools menu, and changing the setting.
This modifies the MaxRemovableDrives setting in the DBLSPACE.INI file.

If restarting the computer does not correct this error, you may already have 15
compressed drives mounted. Restarting does not allow you to mount or create any
more compressed drives using DoubleSpace until you have fewer than 15 compressed
drives mounted.

To mount another compressed drive, you must first unmount one or more of the
currently mounted compressed drives. To unmount a compressed drive, start
DoubleSpace and select the drive to unmount, then choose Unmount from the Drive
menu.

NOTE: You can create more than 15 DoubleSpace-compressed drives, but a maximum of
15 can be mounted at the same time.
