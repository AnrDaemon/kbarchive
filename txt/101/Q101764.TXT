======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Scenes (all collections), versions 1.0, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using a third-party communications program to download files from
CompuServe or any bulletin board service (BBS), the connection may fail when
Microsoft Scenes starts up. The same problem may occur if you are uploading
files to CompuServe or any BBS when Microsoft Scenes starts up.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Scenes for Windows requires most of the CPU time when the screen saver
is starting up. Because most third-party communications programs also require
the same amount of CPU time, the connection may be lost.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, do the following:

1. In Control Panel, choose the 386 Enhanced icon.

2. Under Device Contention, change the Idle setting from 1 to 999.

3. Change the Minimum Time Slice setting to 1.

4. Modify the [386Enh] section of the System.ini file to match the following
   text

         [386Enh]
         COM<x>BUFFER=256
         COM<x>FIFO=ON
         COM<x>PROTOCOL=XOFF
         PAGEBUFFER=32

   where <x> is the number of the communication serial port.

For more information about how to perform this task in Windows, see your Windows
printed documentation or online Help.
