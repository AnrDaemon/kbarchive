The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can use the Move User utility (MOVEUSER.EXE) to move users in the following
three ways:

 - Drag the users to specified postoffices (POs).

-or-

 - Export a user to an .MMU file, and then import that user into the
   destination.

-or-

 - Highlight the user to be moved, and then choose Move from the File menu.

If you use one of the latter two ways to move a user, there is a 50 percent
chance that the user will lose his or her password.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The environment where users lose their passwords is predictable and is dependent
on enhanced security (EN). There are four scenarios that administrators
preparing to use MOVEUSER.EXE should be aware of:

   Source PO          Destination PO          Password Moved
   ---------------------------------------------------------
   EN = on               EN = on                   Yes
   EN = on               EN = off                  Yes
   EN = off              EN = off                  No
   EN = off              EN = on                   No

The Move User utility is dependent on enhanced security because MOVEUSER.EXE
re-encrypts or doesn't encrypt the user's password, depending on how the
MASTER.GLB recorded enhanced security.
