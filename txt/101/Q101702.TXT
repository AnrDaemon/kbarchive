The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under normal circumstances, if the primary member of a mirror set
fails, the Windows NT filesystem (NTFS) marks the member as bad and
does not attempt to use it. However, if you power down the primary
member and boot the system from the shadow (secondary) member of the
mirror set, NTFS does not mark the primary member as bad and the data
on the primary member does not include any changes made to data on the
shadow member.

If this occurs and you restore power to the primary member and reboot
the system, inconsistent data and other problems may occur.
