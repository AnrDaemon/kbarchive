SUMMARY
=======

The Import Utility accepts all external postoffice lists for inclusion in the
Postoffice Address List and the Global Address List.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Import utility will include any address list that is sent to it by any
postoffice on the network. It will then include those addresses in the
Postoffice Address List as an External Postoffice and into the Global Address
List. This could be an administration problem if some Mail Administrators do not
want certain postoffices included in its lists.

If this is the case, Mail administrators should not choose Export, and then
choose All from the External-Admin menu when exporting address lists. A way to
delete the names from a postoffice that has an undesired External Postoffice
Address List, the Mail Administrator would use the Import utility and use the -x
parameter, the -g parameter specifying the offending postoffice (example
-gPCM:networkname\postofficename), and the -f filename parameter to create a
text file with the user names of the offending postoffice. The text file can
then be modified to change the "A" for add user to a "D" for delete user. Then
the text file can be used with the Import utility using the -a parameter and the
user names that belong to the offending postoffice will be deleted from the
postoffice.

Another way is to go to the postoffice you wish to remove undesired external
postoffice addressee from, run the Admin utility on it by selecting
External-admin, List, Delete, and select the name or names you want to remove.
