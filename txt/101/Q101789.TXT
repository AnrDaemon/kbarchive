The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0

Bootsect.dos is created by Windows NT Setup. The boot sector found in
sector 0 of drive C is copied into Bootsect.dos before Setup writes the
Windows NT boot sector. (Setup will not overwrite an existing
Bootsect.dos.) If you choose a previous operating system, Windows NT
executes Bootsect.dos, simulating the previous operating system's normal
boot procedure.

Because the information in Bootsect.dos is really created by the previous
operating system, it is very difficult to re-create. You must transfer the
BIOS parameter block (BPB) from the boot drive (C) at sector 0 into the
boot code from the previous operating system and write this into
Bootsect.dos. To do this, use the following procedure:

1. Use the proper utility to regenerate a boot sector for the previous operating
   system. For example, if the previous operating system is MS-DOS, boot MS-DOS
   from a floppy disk and run the SYS C: command.

2. Start Windows NT Setup from the boot floppy disk (this may be disk 1 of the
   Windows NT floppy disk set, the boot floppy disk for the Windows NT CD-ROM,
   or may have been created during a setup using WINNT.EXE), and initiate
   repairs by pressing R at the first Setup screen.

3. Follow the instructions provided by Setup. When Setup presents you with the
   list of optional repair tasks, make sure you have enabled the "Verify boot
   files on your C: drive" item.

4. Follow instructions until you see a message stating "Setup Repair is
   complete."

Bootsect.dos should now be restored to its original state. You should be
able to boot your previous operating system.
