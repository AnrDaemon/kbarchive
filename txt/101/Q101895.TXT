The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

Copying a Macintosh file from a Windows NT Advanced Server computer
onto an MS-DOS floppy disk may render that Macintosh file unusable.

Macintosh files have two pieces, referred to as the data fork and the
resource fork. NTFS keeps track of both of these forks, thus allowing
Macintosh files to reside undamaged on an NTFS volume.

The standard method for putting Macintosh files on FAT disks is to
split the Macintosh file into its two pieces when the file is copied
to the FAT disk. The two pieces are then put back together when copied
back onto a Macintosh. Because Windows NT Advanced Server Services for
the Macintosh requires an NTFS partition, Windows NT Advanced Server
does not need to split the two forks.

When a Macintosh file is copied from a Windows NT Advanced Server
computer to a FAT disk, the copied file loses the extended attribute
that consisted of the resource fork. When this Macintosh file is used,
it may not work if the Macintosh file needed the resource fork. (As is
the case with an application.)
