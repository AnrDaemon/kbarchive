SUMMARY
=======

The order of initialization of global objects is undefined across translation
units. For example, if your application consists of three C++ modules and each
module declares an object of xyz class, there is no guarantee during program
initialization which of these objects will be constructed first.

In addition to not relying on the order of initialization, you should not use one
object's address in another object's initialization when the two objects are
contained in different translation units.

AT&T 2.1 does not define the order of initialization for global objects
across translation units. The order of initialization is
implementation-dependent.
