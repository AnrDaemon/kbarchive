The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When rebuilding a version 3.0 or 3.1 Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks data
file using Mail Tools, gateway names in the Personal Address Book (PAB) created
by the user are recovered. However, because rebuilding the Mail Data file does
not recover any installed gateways, these recovered gateway names are invalid.
System gateway names, gateway names created by the Network Manager, are NOT
recovered.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.10 recipient
