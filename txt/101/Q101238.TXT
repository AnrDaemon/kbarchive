2. Rename the NETAPI.DLL file in the \WINROOT directory and any others found in
   the PATH statement.

3. Use the NETAPI.DLL file provided with Windows for Workgroups by expanding it
   from your original disks. For example, type the following at the MS-DOS
   command prompt, and then press ENTER:

   expand a:\netapi.dl_ c:\windows\system\netapi.dll
