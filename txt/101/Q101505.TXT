TITLE   :Macintosh Users Logon Only as Guest, Not Registered User
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to logon to a Windows NT Advanced Server from a Macintosh as a
registered user fails.

CAUSE
=====

The Macintosh does not have the Microsoft user authentication module (UAM)
installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install the Microsoft UAM on the Macintosh or perform the following three steps
to reduce the security of the network and eliminate the requirement for its
use:

1. In the Control Panel, choose MacFile.

2. Choose Attributes.

3. Remove the Require Microsoft Authentication check box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server was designed to be a secure operating
system. Windows NT Advanced Services for Macintosh maintains this security by
requiring users to use the Microsoft user authentication module (UAM) when first
logging onto the server. If a user does not have the Microsoft UAM installed,
the option to logon as a registered user is unavailable (dimmed). A logon
attempt without the UAM present would transmit the account name and password
through the network without encrypting them; a network "sniffer" could be used
to access that information.
