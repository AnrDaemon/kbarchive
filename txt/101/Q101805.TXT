SUMMARY
=======

FoxPro for Windows uses the Windows-style Help system by default. However, if
you prefer, you can use the .DBF-style Help system. To do so, enter the
following command in the Command window:

   SET HELP TO FOXHELP.DBF

Pressing F1 or choosing Contents from the menu will then open the .DBF-style Help
system.

To return to the Windows-style Help system, enter the following command in the
Command window:

   SET HELP TO FOXHELP.HLP

To permanently change to the .DBF-style Help system, add this statement to your
CONFIG.FPW file:

   HELP=FOXHELP.DBF

For more information, see the "SET Commands" section of the "Installation and
Configuration Guide." There is also a "Customizing Help" chapter in the
"Developer's Guide" that explains how to create a personalized Help system. The
FoxPro for Windows Distribution Kit (DK) includes a "Help Compiler Guide" to
assist you in creating a personalized Windows Help system.
