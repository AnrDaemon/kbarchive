======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, 2.5a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The error message "Source is out of date" indicates that the source program has
been changed, but not recompiled or generated. This error can also occur if an
"old" version of a program is found in a different subdirectory than the current
version.

FoxPro first creates and then runs a compiled version of a program file. This
compiled version is called an object file and runs faster than a noncompiled
version. This feature cannot be disabled.

To eliminate this error, regenerate the program by opening the source file and
choosing Generate from the Program menu.

If the program is part of a project, open the project and select the Build
option. Then select the Rebuild Project and the Rebuild All options. Rebuild the
project and re-create the application.

If this doesn't work, scan all the subdirectories for occurrences of the source
and object code. Delete the extra files and regenerate the program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To prevent further occurrences of this error, issue the SET DEVELOPMENT ON
command. If you have issued this command and the source code is more current
than its compiled object program, FoxPro will recompile the source code before
it executes the program, thus ensuring that the most current version of a
program is executed.

If the "Source is out of date" error message still occurs, scan all
subdirectories for occurrences of the source and object code. Compiled files in
FoxPro will have the following extensions:

   .FXP - Compiled version of source code program with .PRG extension.
   .APP - Compiled application program.
   .QPX - Compiled version of source code program with .QPR extension.
   .MPX - Compiled version of source code program with .MPR extension.
   .SPX - Compiled version of source code program with .SPR extension.
   .PRX - Compiled version of source code program with .FMT extension.

You can scan for these extensions by using the Find option in the Filer, or, if
you have MS-DOS version 5.0 or later, by typing the following DIR command at the
MS-DOS prompt:

      dir <filename> /s

If duplicate filenames are found, remove the incorrect versions of the files, or
change the FoxPro SET PATH command to ignore the directories where the duplicate
files are found.
