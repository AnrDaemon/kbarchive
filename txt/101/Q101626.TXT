Windows NT supports most removable hard disks and magnetic-optical
disk drives. These disks are treated as hard disks because they must
be partitioned and they are assigned a drive letter. However, Windows
NT does not support write-once disk drives.

Windows NT supports removable media subject to the following
restrictions:

 - A removable hard disk can have only one primary partition. Extended or
   logical partitions are not supported.

 - Windows NT supports only the Windows NT filesystem (NTFS) and
   MS-DOS-compatible (FAT) file system on removable media.

 - The user cannot assign the drive letter for the device.

 - Removable disks are not supported in a fault tolerant manner.

 - You can install the Windows NT system files (the files contained in the WINNT
   directory) on a removable disk. However, the NT boot files, such as NTLDR and
   NTDETECT.COM, must be on the hard disk drive (fixed disk).

 - If the paging file is located on the device or if the device has the NTFS
   installed, the media is locked until the system is shutdown.

 - The FAT file system locks the media while it is in use and unlocks it after
   approximately 10 seconds of inactivity. NOTE: Windows NT supports a 20.8MB
   "floptical" disk as a floppy disk, not as a hard disk. Each write to a floppy
   disk is performed on a write-through cache basis and you can remove a floppy
   disk as long as the drive light is not on.
