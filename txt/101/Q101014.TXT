TITLE   :PRB: Error Decompressing <Filename>/File Copy Operation Failed
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnokeyword

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Running a Setup program written by the SetupWizard generates the following error
messages, even though the Setup program reports completion:

   File copy operation failed - incorrect number of bytes written to disk -
   source file or destination disk may be corrupted - use ChkDsk

   Error decompressing <filename>

CAUSE
=====

The file reported in the error message has been compressed incorrectly, split
incorrectly, or the compressing or splitting process was interrupted. These
errors can be caused by a low-memory (below 640K) situation, too little free
disk space, and/or interruption during compression.

This problem may also be caused by using the default DKSETUP.INI SplitSize
setting.

RESOLUTION
==========


In the directory where the disk images were created, there should be a Compress
subdirectory. Delete all the files in this directory, or free up additional disk
space, and run the SetupWizard again.

If freeing up additional disk space does nOt correct the problem, increase the
SplitSize value in the DKSETUP.INI file from the default of 363520 to 524288.

Or, If you are run under Windows NT, run FoxPro for Windows in its own memory
address space and try running setup wizard again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The COMPRESS subdirectory contains all the files that were compressed, split, or
both during the previous run of the SetupWizard. If a file that is distributed
needs to be compressed or split and it has not changed from the last time the
SetupWizard was run, the file is not compressed or split. Instead, the images
created from the previous run of the SetupWizard are used.
