======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1, 3.1a, 3.1c, 3.1d 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In versions 3.0 and 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, the
workstation Notifier may stop working. This includes the chime, flashing menu
bar, and Notifier window.

CAUSE
=====

The following are possible causes of this problem:

1. The Notifier Preferences options (chimes, flashing menu bar, and Notifier
   window) have been turned off.

2. With System 7 or later, the Apple Menu Item is named something other than the
   required Microsoft Mail.


3. A Claris application or any application that uses modal windows is running.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following are solutions to the causes listed above:

1. To check Notifier Preferences, choose Preferences from the Mail menu. To turn
   on a Notifier option, select the Notifier icon and then click the desired
   option.

2. To enter the correct name for the Apple Menu item, open the Apple Menu Items
   folder from the System folder, and then correctly name the Desk Accessory
   Microsoft Mail.

3. There is no known workaround for this situation. It is known that many Claris
   applications disable the Notifier options until you exit the Claris
   application.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0 and 3.1 of
Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
