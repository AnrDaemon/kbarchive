PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The GRiD Systems model 2260 PEN pointing device, which is designed for use with
the GRiD original equipment manufacturer (OEM) version of Microsoft Windows for
Pen Computing 1.0, stops functioning after you start MS-DOS Prompt in a window.

CAUSE
=====

When you run MS-DOS Prompt in a window, the PEN pointing device becomes disabled
until you close MS-DOS Prompt. The pointing device icon remains in a locked
position in MS-DOS Prompt or in a Windows-based application while MS-DOS Prompt
is still in memory. This behavior does not interfere with subsequent data
processing.

RESOLUTION
==========

Closing MS-DOS Prompt restores full functionality of the PEN pointing device.

The model 2260 PEN pointing device is manufactured by GRiD Systems, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this product's performance or reliability.
