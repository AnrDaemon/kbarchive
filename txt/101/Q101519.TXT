SUMMARY
=======

SQLDataSources() enumerates ODBC data source names and is implemented by the
ODBC Driver Manager. The 'description' it returns through szDescription is the
driver description (as opposed to data source description). This article
discusses how this 'description' can be used, and also why the 'description' is
not a description of the data source, as the name of this function implies.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The driver description given to a driver by a driver developer is recorded in
the ODBC drivers section in the ODBCINST.INI file. For example, the description
for the dBase driver is "dBase Files (*.dbf)." When a data source called
Isamdata is set up for this driver, the following entry is made to the ODBC.INI
file under the ODBC data sources section:

      [ODBC Data Sources]
      Isamdata = dbase Files (*.dbf)

SQLDataSources() returns "dbase Files (*.dbf)" in szDescription for the Isamdata
Data Source. An application can use this by allowing the user to choose
File->Open (using the GetOpenFileName() function in the Windows Common Dialog
Library) for ISAM files.

The application can call SQLDataSources() to get the driver descriptions for the
ODBC data sources, and put the string "(dbase Files)" in the File Name edit
control of the Dialog Box. It can then parse the "*.dbf" part from szDescription
so that the 'List Files of Type' list box can then be used to limit the files
displayed (OPENFILENAME.lpstrFilter for Windows programmers), in this case only
*.dbf files. The application can then make a SQLDriverConnect() call to connect
to the data source, and make the appropriate ODBC calls to get data from the
ISAM file chosen by the user.

It is therefore recommended that driver developers use such descriptions for
their drivers for ISAM-type files.
