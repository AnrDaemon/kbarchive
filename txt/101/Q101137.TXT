The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync) can appear to fail under the conditions
described below.

Using a modem connection, a hub External with the Dir-Sync server is set to call
out to the Requestor postoffice's External, which is configured NOT to call the
hub External. (Calling is often restricted in order to control long-distance
costs.)

If the T1 time is reached and no mail is queued for the Requestor postoffice from
the Server postoffice, the Server External does not call the Requestor
postoffice to retrieve the Dir-Sync mail now waiting to be delivered to the
Server.

If the T2 time is reached and the hub External has received no mail for the
Requestor postoffice, then the Dir-Sync process has no updates from the
Requestor. Mail is not queued for the Requestor until after T2, at which time
External calls the Requestor, sends the update, and retrieves the pending
Dir-Sync mail.

This sequence of events is likely to occur because Dir-Sync is normally scheduled
to run late at night when activity on the postoffice is low and there may be no
mail queued for the Requestor.

The result is that Requestor updates are 24 hours late and Dir-Sync appears to
have failed on the Requestor postoffice.

RESOLUTION
==========

Configure the Requestor External to call the Server External, so that the
Dir-Sync mail is transmitted before the T2 time occurs.
