KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to format a disk either from a virtual machine in 386 enhanced mode
or by using File Manager, Microsoft Windows may stop responding (hang) with some
drive controllers manufactured by Great Software Ideas (GSI).

In 386 enhanced mode, the File Manager or MS-DOS FORMAT process appears to begin
normally, but then the computer hangs and requires a warm boot. The same process
works correctly in standard mode.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs on the GSI Drive Controller Model 11 with BIOS versions 1.14
and earlier and on the Model 21 with BIOS versions 2.0 and earlier. GSI has
confirmed the incompatibility of these BIOS versions with Windows 3.0 and 3.1 in
386 enhanced mode and has BIOS upgrades available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, order the appropriate update version for the GSI Flash
BIOS.

   Model  BIOS version
   -------------------

   11     1.15 or later
   21     2.01 or later

You can work around this problem by doing either of the following:

 - Format the disk using File Manager or MS-DOS in standard mode.

   -or-

 - Quit Windows and format the disk using MS-DOS.
