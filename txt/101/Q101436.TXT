TITLE   :Deleting DoubleSpace Drives Causes the System to Hang
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you delete all your DoubleSpace-compressed drives using the MS-DOS 6.0
DoubleSpace maintenance program, the system may stop responding (hang) when the
"Starting MS-DOS..." prompt appears during startup. Pressing the F5 or F8
function key at the "Starting MS-DOS..." prompt may cause the system to appear
to operate properly. The system may ask for user input and then hang with a
blinking cursor. After hanging, the system cannot accept keyboard input;
therefore, a reset is required to restart (reboot) the computer.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if drive C has been set as the last drive reserved for
DoubleSpace's use (LastDrive=C) in the DBLSPACE.INI file. The MS-DOS 6.0
DoubleSpace maintenance program does not delete the DBLSPACE.INI file when the
last DoubleSpace drive is deleted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, delete the DBLSPACE.INI file and reboot the computer.
To do so:

1. Boot your computer from an MS-DOS 6.0 bootable floppy disk. Make sure that
   the floppy disk does not contain the DBLSPACE.BIN file.

2. Remove the attributes from the DBLSPACE.INI file as follows:

   c:\dos\attrib -s -h -r c:\dblspace.ini

3. Delete the DBLSPACE.INI file and remove the floppy disk from drive A.

4. Reboot the computer.

The system should now boot from the hard disk.
