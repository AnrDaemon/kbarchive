SUMMARY
=======

By using Microsoft's TrueType Font Pack version 1 and Windows NT Services for
Macintosh (SFM), you can print from a Macintosh computer to a non- PostScript
printer attached to a Windows NT Advanced Server or Windows NT Server running
SFM. This functionality is provided by the TrueImage interpreter that converts a
PostScript file into a high-resolution bitmap image.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To support this feature, a Windows NT Advanced Server or Windows NT Server must
have the Microsoft Windows version 3.1 TrueType Font Pack installed. You can
order the TrueType Font Pack version 1, part number 209-650v100, from your local
reseller or directly from Microsoft. In the United States, call Microsoft
Consumer Sales at (800) 227-4679. If you are outside the United States, contact
the Microsoft subsidiary for your area. To locate your subsidiary, see the
Microsoft World Wide Offices Web site at:

If the TrueType Font Pack is not installed, printed characters may appear with
strikeouts and the printout may appear with jagged printing.
