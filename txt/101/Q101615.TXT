-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reminders in version 1.0 of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows are loaded when
you start Schedule+, or when you start Windows (if the Reminders icon is in
the Windows Startup group). You can cause Schedule+ Reminders to only
function when Schedule+ is running or not to function at all.

You can use the following command-line parameters to control this
functionality:

   /x     Turns off Reminders when you exit out of Schedule+.

   /r     Completely turns off Schedule+ Reminders--you will never be
          reminded of anything.

Example
-------

By default, Schedule+ Reminders checks your calendar file every minute.
Over a Remote Access (RAS) connection line, this can be very time
consuming. By turning off reminders, Schedule+ should work much faster.

To completely turn off reminders, do the following:

1. Select the Schedule+ icon in Windows Program Manager.

2. From the Program Manager File menu, choose Properties.

3. Modify the Command Line box to read as follows:

   c:\schdplus\schdplus.exe /r

Additional query words: schedule plus 1.00 1.00a bell chime
