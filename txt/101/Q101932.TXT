The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 2.1d, 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use version 2.1d, 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows,
group names are expanded on the recipient line, revealing all the members of the
group.

Situations When Group Names Are NOT Expanded
--------------------------------------------

With versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, when a message is
sent to a group that is present in the Postoffice List, the Global Address List
(GAL), or the Network List, the group names are not expanded. This includes
groups containing local postoffice users, external postoffice users, and both
local and external users.

With version 2.1d of Microsoft Mail for Windows, when a message is sent to a
group that is present in the Postoffice List, the Personal Address List, or the
Network List, the group names are not expanded. This includes groups containing
local users, external users, and both local and external users.

Situations When Group Names ARE Expanded
----------------------------------------

With versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, when a message is
sent to a group created in the Personal Address Book (PAB), the group name is
expanded to reveal the friendly names of all the members of the group. This
occurs only when the group is created in the Personal Address Book and does not
contain any other groups defined in the Postoffice Address List (PAL), the
Global Address List, or the Network List. If the group created in the Personal
Address Book contains other groups that are defined in the Postoffice Address
List, the Global Address List, or the Network List, the group name is expanded
to reveal the members of that group, which are other groups; however, these
member groups are not expanded.

With version 2.1d of Microsoft Mail for Windows, when a message is sent to a
group of people using version 2.1d or later of Mail for Windows, the version
2.1d users receive the message with the group name NOT expanded. MS-DOS client
users with version 3.0 or later also receive the message with the group name NOT
expanded. Windows client users with version 3.0 or later receive the message
with the group name expanded. The group name is expanded to reveal the mailbox
names and not the friendly names of the members of the group.
