The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Versions 3.0 and 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks uses a single copy
store architecture. This means that for a message/enclosure sent to many users
on a Mail server, only one copy of the message/enclosure is created that each
recipient accesses. The message/enclosure is not deleted until the last
recipient deletes the message.

When forwarding a message, a new message is created. However, if you are also
forwarding an enclosure, this new message references the old enclosure. The
enclosure is NOT duplicated.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.10
