SUMMARY
=======

The standard output stream (cout) can be used in an application or Dynamic- Link
Library (DLL) to display information. When using cout in an application and a
DLL simultaneously, special care is needed to ensure that the text display is
synchronized.

Because the cout text stream is buffered, text from a DLL may not appear correct
relative to text from the application. To correct this problem, always use the
endl manipulator when outputting text with cout. Below is an example:

      cout << "Hello World" << endl;

The endl manipulator inserts a newline character and then flushes the stream
buffer. This ensures that text displayed from the application and DLL is
synchronized.
