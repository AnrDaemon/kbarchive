The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, 2.5a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to page C3-723 in the FoxPro 2.0 "Commands & Functions" manual
and page L3-886 of the FoxPro 2.5 "Language Reference" manual, SET CARRY ON
will "bring all fields from the current record to a new record." This
statement is incorrect. SET CARRY ON will not bring forward memo or general
fields. (Using SET CARRY TO and specifying the memo or general field also
will not bring the memo or general field forward.)

To copy the contents of a memo field to a new record, use the REPLACE
command. For example:

      temp = db.memfield
      APPEND BLANK
      REPLACE db.memfield WITH temp

NOTE: The following methods require that the system menu bars and
appropriate shortcut keys be available for _MED_COPY and _MED_PASTE, and
that the menu be active and available (SET SYSMENU ON or SET SYSMENU
AUTOMATIC).

To copy a general field, use the following code:

      USE table1
      SELECT 0
      USE table2
      SELECT table1
      SKIP 1
      KEYBOARD "{ctrl+c} {ctrl+w}"
      MODIFY GENERAL table1.genfield
      SELECT table2
      APPEND BLANK
      KEYBOARD "{ctrl+v} {ctrl+w}"
      MODIFY GENERAL table2.genfield

 

To carry all information from all fields, except for general fields, into a
new record, use one of the following methods:

Method 1
--------

      SCATTER MEMVAR MEMO
      APPEND BLANK
      GATHER MEMVAR MEMO

Method 2
--------

      SET CARRY ON
      BROWSE NOWAIT
      KEYBOARD "{CTRL+N}"
