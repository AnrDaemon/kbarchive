======================================================================
When your system is booting, it designates the first disk it finds as
boot disk. If you have two SCSI controllers, LADDR by default boots
from the one it finds first. If you want to boot from the other one,
rename it BOOT.BID so that LADDR will find it first from then on.

SPARE001.SYS was set up because any bid that is not registered in
IOCFG01.SYS is not tried as the LADDR drivers are loaded. If you
rename any new bid that comes out SPARE001.SYS, it will be tried as
well. The other option is to include a "device = " line in the
CONFIG.SYS file.

Additional query words: boot 2.10 2.10a 2.20 2.1 2.1a 2.2
