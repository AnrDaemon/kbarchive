-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.0, 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Global Server Report in the version 2.0, 3.0, or 3.1 Microsoft Mail for
AppleTalk Networks Mail Network Administrator may show asterisks (*) for the
zone name.

CAUSE
=====

This may occur for one of the following three reasons:

 - The Server is not connected to an Apple Internet; therefore, no Internet
   routers exist. Routers provide zone information on an AppleTalk network.

 - When a new server, Server B, asks for the version of an existing server,
   Server A, then Server A also learns about the existence of Server B. Server A
   has a network address to which it can send mail to Server B, but it does not
   have the textual name of Server B's zone. Server A enters an "*" for the
   zone. The next time Server A does a full network scan it will learn what zone
   Server B is in. The "*" zone is a temporary state that a new server might be
   in for a few hours until it is seen on a normal scan.

 - If a portion of the network becomes unplugged/unattached from the main
   network and loses contact with any routers, then when a server does a scan,
   all other servers on that portion of the network will appear to be in zone
   "*". The scanning server will remember this until the next time it does a
   full scan after the routers have been restored.
