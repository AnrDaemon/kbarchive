PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, your sign-in is
validated against the ACCESS4.GLB file in your <WINDOWS>\MSMAIL\MSRMT\GLB
directory. As a result, you may experience one of the following situations:

 - If ACCESS4.GLB is invalid, you can get various modes of operation or
   non-operation, including a general protection fault (GP-Fault).

 - If ACCESS4.GLB is missing, you can sign in, but you will get the following
   message before Mail aborts:

   Mail cannot connect to your mail server

In both cases, no message indicates problems with the ACCESS4.GLB or that it is
missing; however once identified, the workaround is easy.

RESOLUTION
==========

To create a new ACCESS4.GLB, before running Mail Remote for Windows, copy the
contents of the user data disk to your <WINDOWS>\MSMAIL\MSRMT\USERINFO
directory. The file will be created when you start Mail Remote for Windows.

You should choose Update Address Lists upon your next connection to your
postoffice to update your address books.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
Remote for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
