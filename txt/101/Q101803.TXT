The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro Library Construction Kit for MS-DOS, versions 2.5, 2.5a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.5, 2.5a

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Visual C++, the .CPP extension can cause errors when it is used to
create a .PLB or .FLL file with the FoxPro 2.5 Library Construction Kit (LCK).

For example, using the .CPP extension to create a .FLL file (FoxPro for Windows
library) can cause the error "<path>\PROAPIML.LIB
(c:\dosdev\source\winapi16.c) : error L2029: '_FoxTable' : unresolved external",
where <path> is the path to PROAPIML.LIB.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid the error, do one of the following:

 - Rename the program to have a .C extension.

-or-

 - Declare FoxTable as external, as follows:


         extern "C" FoxTable _FoxTable =
         {
            (FoxTable FAR *) 0, sizeof(myFoxInfo) / 
               sizeof(FoxInfo), myFoxInfo
         };
