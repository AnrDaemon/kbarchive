TITLE   :PC Adm: Deleted External User Still Shows
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an administrator deletes external Mail users from the postoffice address list
(ADMIN.NME) by selecting Admin, Address, Delete, the user will still show up
when accessed by choosing Address, Create Network. This is because the Address,
Create option displays the user list from the <8DIGIT>.USR file for the
external postoffice.

CAUSE
=====

When an address is created by selecting Address, Create, the Administrator
program (ADMIN.EXE) adds the user from the Network list to the Postoffice
Address List. When the address is deleted by choosing Address, Delete, the
Administrator program deletes the user from the Postoffice Address List.

This is expected behavior for Admin.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.20 admin
