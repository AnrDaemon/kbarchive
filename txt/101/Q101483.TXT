The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Versions 3.0 and 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks do not encrypt the
contents of the server data file or local user data.

Encryption schemes are used when mail data is being transferred from the user
workstation to the server or between servers.

Because of this, Microsoft recommends placing the mail server in a physically
secure location such as a computer room. Sensitive data should not be placed on
local user machines unless that machine is also physically secure or there is
additional software security available.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.10
