SUMMARY
=======

Although you can create a quick screen or form without using a mouse in the
FoxPro 2.x Screen Builder or Visual FoxPro Form Designer, a mouse is required to
subsequently modify that screen or form.

The Screen Builder and Form Designer toolbars cannot be accessed without a mouse.
This behavior is by design. FoxPro for MS-DOS does not have a toolbar for its
Screen Builder; it uses menus instead.

NOTE: The system requirements listed on the FoxPro for Windows and Visual FoxPro
boxes state that a mouse or compatible pointing device is required.
