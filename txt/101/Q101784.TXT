TITLE   :After Creating Backup Domain Controller Cannot Logon as Admin.
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You make a server a backup domain controller. After setup is complete, you
attempt to logon to the administrative account using the correct password. The
password validation fails. However, logging on with no password to the
administrative account is successful.

CAUSE
=====

A backup domain controller replicates its database from the current domain
controller. The initial replication occurs after the Netlogon service is started
during the first boot after installation has completed. Before replication
occurs (and user account databases are in sync), the backup domain controller
has the default database (which includes the Administrator account with no
password). Since the initial replication can take an extended period of time
(several minutes for a large domain), there is a period after the initial boot
during which you can log on to the backup domain controller using the accounts
in the default database, but not those accounts in the domain.

RESOLUTION
==========

Wait for database replication to finish before attempting to log on from a
registered account.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Advanced Server
version 3.1. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
