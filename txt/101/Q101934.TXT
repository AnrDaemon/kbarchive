TITLE   :PC Ext: Attachments Not Returned When Useful Life Is Exceeded
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0a,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the External Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE), if a message with
attachments is sent that has exceeded its "useful life" and the asynchronous
communication is interrupted, the message is returned to the sender with no
attachments. If the same scenario exists but there is no interruption of
asynchronous services, the message with attachments is delivered to the remote
client even though the useful life has been exceeded.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0a, and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
