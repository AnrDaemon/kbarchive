In the Add Users And Groups dialog box in File Manager, the following
problem may occur:

You try to add a default group (Everyone for example) from a domain
that uses a different language to a set of directory permissions. For
example, the other machine has a German installation of Windows NT.
You receive an error telling you that the other machine was not found.

To avoid this problem, select the other computer you want to add from
the List Names From list box, or enter it in the Add Names field in
the other language.

NOTE: This problem occurs only with default or "well-known" groups and
occur only when trying to add a well-known group from a domain in a
different language than the one where the resource (directory)
resides.
