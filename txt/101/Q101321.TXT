TITLE   :ADT: Cannot Select Any Object Except MS Access Menu
PRODUCT :Microsoft Access Distribution Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,1.1,2.0,7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0 
 - Microsoft Access for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

One of the following two conditions occurs:

 - You can select only the Microsoft Access menu. All other objects appear as
   they normally do, but you cannot select them.

   -or-

 - Your application has stopped on a breakpoint that you set in a function, but
   you cannot use the indicator to set the focus to the Module window.

CAUSE
=====

Your code has executed an Echo action and turned the echo off. You need to turn
the echo back on by setting Echo On to Yes (the default).

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, do one of the following:

 - Correct the logic of your program.

   -or-

 - Add a key assignment in your Key Assignment macro.

   NOTE: By default, the Key Assignment macro is set to the AutoKeys macro.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create the following function:

   Function FunctionThatAppearsHung()
      Dim i as integer
      DoCmd.Echo False
      'In version 1.x and 2.0, the above line should be DoCmd Echo False
      'with no period (.).
      Debug.Print i
      DoCmd.Echo True
      ' In version 1.x and 2.0, the above should be DoCmd Echo True
      ' with no period (.).
   End Function

2. Using the F9 key, set a breakpoint on the following line:

   Debug.Print i

3. Type the following in the Debug window (or the Immediate Window in version
   1.x and 2.0), and then press ENTER:

   ?FunctionThatAppearsHung()

4. To give control back to Microsoft Access, either quit Microsoft Access or
   define the AutoKeys macro as follows, and then press F12:

   MacroName    Action    Arguments
   --------------------------------
   {F12}        Echo      Yes
