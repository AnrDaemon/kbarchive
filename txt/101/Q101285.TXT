The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to share a local printer, you may receive the following error
message:

   STOP! you must type a full path including a drive letter

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when the TEMP environment variable is set to a directory that
does not exist.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this situation:

1. Edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file with a text editor, such as Microsoft Windows
   Notepad. Ensure the SET TEMP statement is similar to the following:

         SET TEMP=C:\WINDOWS\TEMP

2. Run File Manager and ensure there is a C:\WINDOWS\TEMP directory. If there is
   not, choose Create Directory from the File menu and create C:\WINDOWS\TEMP.

3. If you changed your AUTOEXEC.BAT file in step 1, you need to exit Windows for
   Workgroups and restart your computer.
