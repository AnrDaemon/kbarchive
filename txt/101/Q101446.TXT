TITLE   :Mac Gty: MS Mail GW Does Not Reselect Server on Restart
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For Appletalk Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, the server may
stop processing mail for a gateway. Mail will queue in the Microsoft Mail Data
file, which can be viewed with the Mail Network Administrator program, and will
not be transported to the gateway service. This problem will occur after any
restart of the machine, most commonly after a backup has taken place

CAUSE
=====

There is a known problem with the MS Mail GW 3.1 Chooser extension where the
server is not re-selected by the GW code.

RESOLUTION
==========

A temporary workaround for this problem is to re-select the server from within
the Chooser. This will only correct the situation until you restart the machine.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the MS Mail GW file included
with version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks. This problem was
corrected with version 3.1a of the MS Mail GW file.

Additional query words: 3.10 chooser choosered queued
