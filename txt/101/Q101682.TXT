The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, versions 2.1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP may display this message:

   ERROR network_read: timed out
   ERROR SMTP_get_response:getline () <=0
   [tx] Quit
   ERROR network_read: timed out
   ERROR SMTP_get_response:getline () <=0
   SMTP_close (socket=257)
   NC_incoming:system error

This indicates that the SMTP gateway was unable to complete the message transfer
to the smarthost configured in the Administrator program (Gateway-SMTP-SETUP:
"IP address of SMTP Router"). This error message may appear in these
situations:

 - The smart host goes down.

-or-

 - The network between the SMTP gateway computer and the smarthost is down.

You can test these trouble points by trying to PING the smarthost or doing a
TELNET to port 25 of the smarthost. Once this test is successful, the gateway
will run. For example

   PING 123.123.12.1
   TELNET 123.123.12.1 25

where 123.123.12.1 is the IP address of the smarthost.

If this error message occurs frequently, check the network with a protocol
analyzer for problems.
