 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After you use the Gateway Installer for version 3.0 or 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for
AppleTalk Networks to install a gateway, which supports auto-propagating access
gateways, access gateway information will be propagated to all other servers in
the same site. You must check the "All in-site servers can access" check box for
this to happen.

After auto-propagation has occurred, when a new Mail server appears in the
gateway server's site, the new server automatically becomes an access gateway,
like the rest of the servers in the site.

When the master gateway is removed, a server-server classified message titled
MasterGone is sent to all servers in the same site. This causes each server to
remove all of its resources related to the gateway.
