The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Hercules Graphics Station video card runs correctly in standard mode only if
you are using version 2.05 or higher of this card. You can locate the version of
the card by running TIGACD.EXE, which ships with the card. The TIGACD sign-on
message displays the TIGA version number.

If you try to start Windows in standard mode with an earlier version of this
card, the lower half of the screen displays garbage characters and the upper
half is black.

MORE INFORMATION

version of the card itself is 2.05 or higher. Also, using the TIGA drivers or
the VGA driver that ships with Windows 3.1 does not allow this card to work in
standard mode.
