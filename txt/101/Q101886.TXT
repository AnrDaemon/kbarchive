SUMMARY
=======

The SENTRY directory created by Microsoft Undelete is always displayed in MS-DOS
Shell, even though it has the Hidden attribute.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Delete Sentry provides the highest level of protection to ensure that you can
recover deleted files. This level of protection creates a hidden directory named
SENTRY. When you delete a file, Undelete moves the file from its current
location to the SENTRY directory.

The SENTRY directory is created when you load Microsoft Undelete with Delete
Sentry protection enabled. For more information on Delete Sentry, see pages
83-89, "Recovering Deleted Files," in the "User's Guide," or query on the
following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   " undelete and sentry " (without the quotation marks)

The hidden SENTRY directory always appears in the Shell directory tree listing,
regardless of whether or not the Display Hidden/System Files option is selected
in the File Display Options dialog box. This occurs because the MS-DOS Shell is
designed to always show directories with the Hidden or System attribute.

If Undelete is loaded with the /LOAD switch (specifying Delete Sentry
protection), you cannot delete the files in the SENTRY directory from the MS-DOS
command prompt, Shell, or File Manager. To remove the files in this directory,
using the /PURGE switch is recommended.

To manually delete files from the SENTRY directory, restart the computer without
loading Delete Sentry and then delete the files.
