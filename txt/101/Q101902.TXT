The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you download the postoffice address lists in Mail Remote for Windows two or
more times in the same session (that is, without exiting and restarting Mail
Remote), the external postoffice address lists on your hard disk may become
corrupted.

You can avoid this problem by only downloading the postoffice address lists once
during a Mail Remote session. If you only use Mail Remote for Windows (and no
other type of Mail) and you leave your computer running continually, you should
exit and sign out of Mail after each session (especially if you download the
address list during that session).

After the second download of the address list, when you open the Global Address
List (GAL) and request Details on an External user, the following error message
appears:

   A GLB file on your server is corrupt. Contact your system administrator.

The external postoffice's address list shows no names defined on that postoffice.
This is true for all external postoffices.

If you send a mail message to the external user by using the GAL for addressing,
no message is sent. The SESSION.LOG file reports the following messages:

   No mail to send

   Tsk 5, Ec -1,
   ResetModem on error!
   ReversePump on error!

NOTE: You must add the following two lines to the [SFS Remote] section of the
workstation's MSMAIL.INI file in order to see the messages shown above. These
settings provide additional diagnostic information that is recorded in the
SESSION.LOG file.

   Verbose=1
   Debuglog=1

If the upload is aborted, the message is returned as undeliverable and the
following message appears:

   A message recipient was not supplied. The recipient has been deleted or has
   no e-mail address.

If you send mail to both a local postoffice user and an external postoffice user,
the message is only sent to the local user. However, no error message indicating
a failure to deliver to the External user is reported.

CAUSE
=====

If the address list is updated only once per session, the corruption does not
occur. The second download of the address list causes the address name files
(*.NME) to be renamed to a higher sequence number; however, the Windows Remote
client is still seeking the original filename. Manually renaming the files to
the correct filename does not work, because the .GLB files relating to the GAL
are also incorrect.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two ways to repair the corrupt address lists:

 - Exit and re-enter Mail Remote for Windows and download the address lists
   again. This builds the files with the proper filenames.

-or-

 - Have the Mail administrator generate a new Data disk and use this disk to
   restore the directories. To do this, choose Options from the Mail menu.
   Choose Server, then specify the disk drive containing the Data disk.

STATUS
======

Remote for Windows. This problem was corrected in MSRMTUI.DLL version
