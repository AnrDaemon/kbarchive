======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the VSafe Manager program (MWAVTSR.EXE) in Windows and the option
for Show Icon is not selected, VSafe Manager does not appear in the Task List.
(It does appear if Show Icon is selected.)

CAUSE
=====

VSafe Manager is a memory-resident program that allows VSafe messages to be
displayed in Windows. If you deselect Show Icon from the Options menu in VSafe
Manager, the minimized icon for VSafe Manager is hidden and the program does not
appear in the Task List. The Show Icon option is selected by default.

WORKAROUND
==========

Though VSafe Manager does not appear in the Task List, it is still resident in
memory. To regain access to VSafe Manager, choose Run from the File menu in
Program Manager and then type "mwavtsr.exe" (without the quotation marks).

NOTE: The Task List is a window that displays a list of all currently running
applications. To access the Task List, double-click with the mouse anywhere on
the desktop or press CTRL+ESC.
