The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

When you have a DoubleSpace-compressed drive that is less than 25 percent full,
the DBLSPACE /RATIO command results in the following error message:

   DoubleSpace is examining drive <drive letter>.
   Drive <drive letter> already has an estimated compression ratio of nn.n
   to 1.

If the drive is less than 25 percent full, you can set the estimated compression
ratio (ECR) manually, but DoubleSpace cannot set the ECR equal to the actual
compression ratio (ACR).

MORE INFORMATION
================

DBLSPACE /RATIO adjusts the ECR to the ACR, unless the DoubleSpace drive is less
than 25 percent full.

When a drive is less than 25 percent full, the data contained in it may not be
representative of the data the drive will eventually hold. Therefore, on
average, it is better to maintain a 2:1 compression ratio until the drive is 25
percent full.

In some cases, if the ECR is set to a low value, the ratio is adjusted when you
run DBLSPACE /RATIO. However, if the ECR is then set to a high value, the ratio
is not adjusted because by setting the ECR higher, the space used falls below 25
percent. Subsequent use of the DBLSPACE /RATIO command results in the message
noted above.

Additional query words: 6.00 % double space 6.20
