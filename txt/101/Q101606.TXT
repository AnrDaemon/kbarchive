TITLE   :PC Adm: Data Disk Not Updated After Regenerate
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When creating a remote user data disk with version 3.0 or 3.0a of the
Administration program for Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, changes in address
information may not be correctly updated.

If the Administration program is left running after the data disk is first
generated and until the address information is changed, the regenerated data
disk does not contain any address changes. The date and time stamps of the files
on the regenerated remote data disk reflect the date of the regeneration but the
address information in the RNETWORK.GLB file is left unchanged.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, exit the Administration program after the remote
user's address information has been changed, then restart the Administration
program and regenerate the directory view selecting either Update Disk or Init
Disk. The newly created data disk reflects the correctly updated address
information selected for the remote user.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0 and 3.0a of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. This problem was corrected in version 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.
