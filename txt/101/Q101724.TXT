SUMMARY
=======

If you are using Novell NetWare in conjunction with Microsoft Windows and you
try to change drive mappings inside a virtual machine (VM), the condition of
those drive mappings after you exit the VM depends on two Novell Netware
switches: NWshareHandles and RestoreDrives.

Both these switches are set in the 386 Enhanced section of the Network dialog box
in Control Panel. Changing these settings modifies the following lines in the
NetWare section of the SYSTEM.INI file:

   NWShareHandles= <true> or <false>
   RestoreDrives= <true> or <false>

MORE INFORMATION
================

The default setting of NWShareHandles=FALSE causes NetWare to behave with the
Inherited-visibility method. The optional setting of NWShareHandles=True makes
the 386 enhanced mode NetWare driver use the Global-visibility method instead.

The NWShareHandles setting is a function of the Novell redirector.With this
setting set to False, new virtual machines (VMs) inherit mappings from the
MS-DOS environment. However, if you add a mapping, it appears only in that VM.
Base mappings remain untouched and new ones in each VM are unique.

When you exit Windows and RestoreDrives is set to True, Windows restores your
mappings to the way things were before you started Windows. This is important
because mappings change as you use them, especially if they are not map rooted.
