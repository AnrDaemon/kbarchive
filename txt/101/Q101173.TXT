The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Workgroup Connections, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Setup program for Microsoft Workgroup Connections version 1.0
modifies the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files located at the root
directory of the startup drive, regardless of where you are installing
Workgroup Connections. This operation is by design.

Workgroup Connections 1.0 also creates SYSTEM.INI and PROTOCOL.INI
files in the directory where you installed Workgroup Connections. If
you mistakenly installed Workgroup Connections into your Windows for
Workgroups directory, it modifies the SYSTEM.INI and PROTOCOL.INI
files that  are required for Windows for Workgroups. This may cause
errors to occur when you run Windows for Workgroups.


Additional query words: 3.10 connection remote diskless 1.0
