SYMPTOMS

When you try to restore backups with Microsoft Backup for MS-DOS or Microsoft
Backup for Windows, you receive the following error message:

   Alert! Unknown compression of file

=====

This error occurs when:

 - The backups were made with a beta version of Microsoft Backup.

-or-

 - You used MS-DOS 6.22 to create a compressed backup and then attempted to
   restore it using Microsoft Backup for MS-DOS 6.0.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you made backups with a beta version of Microsoft Backup, there is no
workaround for this situation. You must create new backups with the final
release version of MS-DOS 6.0 or later.

If you made backups under MS-DOS 6.22 Backup with compression turned on, either
restore the data with MS-DOS 6.22 version of Backup, or back up the data with
compression turned off.
