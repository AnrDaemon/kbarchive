A drop folder is a folder in which a user has only Make Changes
permission. Because of the differences in the manner Windows NT
supports Advanced Server and Macintosh-style permissions, Windows NT
supports drop folder permissions only for the immediate contents of
the drop folder.

To ensure consistent access to subdirectories of drop folders,
recursively apply drop folder permissions to all enclosed
subdirectories. You can do this in the File Manager by choosing
Directory Permissions from the MacFile menu, or in the Sharing dialog
box on the Macintosh client. If you subsequently add a subdirectory to
a drop folder, you must update its permissions to reflect drop folder
access.
