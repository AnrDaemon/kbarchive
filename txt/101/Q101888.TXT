There are two ways to work around this problem:

   2. In Program Manager, choose New from the File menu.

   3. Select Program Item, and choose OK.

   4. In the Description box, type "Undelete" (without the quotation marks).

   5. In the Command Line box, type "C:\DOS\MWUNDEL.EXE" (without the quotation
      marks) where "C:\DOS" is the directory containing your MS-DOS files.

      NOTE: Do not use the file UNDELETE.EXE, which is for the MS-DOS level
      Undelete utility.

   6. In the Working Directory box, type the location of the Windows directory,
      for example "C:\WINDOWS" (without the quotation marks), then choose OK.
