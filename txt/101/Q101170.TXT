and the model DC200 ISA-cached IDE controller card both need a firmware update
to run properly with the MS-DOS 6.0 DoubleSpace disk- compression program.

digits of the EPROM number. If the last four digits are 203E, 203O, or 203X, the
card is compatible with DoubleSpace. The latest revisions as of 6/20/93 are as
