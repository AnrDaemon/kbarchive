TITLE   :Scenes 1.0: Scenes in Startup Group Affects Logon Applications
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Scenes (all collections), version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a program with a logon feature in your Startup group, when you start
Windows, Scenes does not allow you to log on without manually switching to the
program's logon dialog box.

When you install Microsoft Scenes version 1.0 for Windows, a program item is
placed in the Startup group of Program Manager.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do the following:

1. In the Startup group in Program Manager, rearrange the program icons so that
   the Scenes icon is placed before all other program icons.

2. In Program Manager, press and hold down the ALT key while you press ENTER
   (ALT+ENTER) to view the program item properties of each program in the
   Startup group. Make sure the Run Minimized box for each program contains a
   check.

3. On the Options menu, make sure Minimize On Use is checked.

NOTE: Setting programs with logon features to use the "Minimize on Use" option
does not prevent the logon dialog box from automatically appearing.
