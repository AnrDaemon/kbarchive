-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The setup program for Lucid Lightning disk-caching software does not detect
other disk-caching software, such as Microsoft SMARTDrive version 4.x, if it is
loaded high in upper memory. If disk-caching software is loaded low, Lucid
Lightning disables it. In addition, the installations of Windows 3.1, Windows
for Workgroups 3.1, and MS-DOS 6.0 do not detect third-party disk- caching
software. As a result, running both disk-caching utilities simultaneously may
produce cross-linked files or lost clusters.

To correct this problem, disable one of the two disk-caching utilities by
modifying the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

MORE INFORMATION
================
