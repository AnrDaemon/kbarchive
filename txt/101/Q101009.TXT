The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can use the DDEPOKE() function to insert information from FoxPro for
Windows into a document created in Microsoft Word versions 2.0c and 6.0 for
Windows.

In order to use the DDEPOKE() function, you must declare in the Word
document a specific location to poke the information into. To declare the
location, create a bookmark within the Word document. For example, the
following code will poke information into a Word document that has a
bookmark called "test":

      run /n i:\winword\winword.exe i:\winword\letter.doc
      mchannel=DDEinitiate("WinWord","i:\winword\letter.doc")
      =DDESETOPTION('SAFETY',.F.)
      =DDEPOKE(mchannel,"test","Hello World!")
      =DDETERMINATE(mchannel)

 
NOTE: =DDESETOPTION('SAFETY',.F.) is an option to set safety off so the
program doesn't ask if you want to start the other program if it's not
already started.

The topic name for the DDEINITIATE() function must be the document name; in
this example, the document name is "c:\winword\letter.doc". The string
"Hello World!" will be inserted in the document at the "test" bookmark.
