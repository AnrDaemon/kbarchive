TITLE   :PRB: "Missing Operand" Error Using a Database in FoxCentral
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fox Miscellaneous Products
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for MS-DOS, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You receive the

   Operand Missing

error message when you use FoxCentral and attempt to use an index on a database.

CAUSE
=====

FoxCentral saves all information about its environment in two files called
CENTRAL.ADM and CENTRAL.ADX. This environment information includes frequently
used databases and any indexes associated with them. Because FoxCentral saves
this information in these two files, if the databases saved in these environment
files are modified outside FoxCentral, the information saved in the files can
become outdated or invalid.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Quit FoxBASE+ and rename the files CENTRAL.ADM and CENTRAL.ADX to
   CENTRAL2.ADM and CENTRAL2.ADX using the MS-DOS RENAME command.

2. Restart FoxBASE+ and go into FoxCentral.

You should now be able to use the database and its corresponding index without a
problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

FoxCentral is the nonprogramming user interface in FoxBASE+ for MS-DOS that
gives users access to the most powerful FoxBASE+ commands without doing any
programming.
