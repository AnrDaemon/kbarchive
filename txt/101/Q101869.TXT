======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The following error conditions cause a "Printer out of paper" message when your
printer is connected to a serial port:

 - The printing device is out of paper.

 - The printing device is offline.

 - The printing device is switched off.

 - The cable to the printing device is disconnected.

CAUSE
=====

When you print to a serial port, there is only one error condition available
(time-out). In a serial connection, there are no status lines available to
inform Windows NT as to which specific problem exists (as do parallel ports).
Therefore, Windows NT defaults to "Printer out of paper" with serial printers.
