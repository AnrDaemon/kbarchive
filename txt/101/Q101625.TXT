SUMMARY
=======

The ORACLE.TXT file that shipped with Visual Basic version 3.0's ODBC Oracle
driver has changed. The new version contains important troubleshooting
information that is not available in the shipping version.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual Basic version 3.0 (VB3.0) ships with the ODBC Oracle driver, which allows
programmers to write applications that can make use of data in an Oracle server.
One of the components installed with the ODBC Oracle driver is a file called
ORACLE.TXT. This is installed in the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory. ORACLE.TXT
contains a lot of information about how to install components that are required
to connect to an Oracle Server using the ODBC Oracle driver. This information
includes: the versions of SQL*Net for Windows that required, the contents and
location of configuration files, troubleshooting tips for common error messages,
and so forth.

Since the release of Visual Basic 3.0, Oracle has released new updates to the
SQL*Net .DLLs; as a result of this, the information in the ORACLE.TXT is no
longer current. The new ORACLE.TXT containing the updated information is
available from Microsoft Product Support Services. Please note that Microsoft
Access version 1.1 ships the updated version of ORACLE.TXT. If you have
installed Access after installing Visual Basic, then you will automatically have
the new ORACLE.TXT. Otherwise, you can reinstall the Oracle driver from the
Access ODBC disk to obtain the new ORACLE.TXT.
