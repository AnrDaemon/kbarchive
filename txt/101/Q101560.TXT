-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

By default, Microsoft Anti-Virus and Microsoft Anti-Virus for Windows store a
CHKLIST.MS file (marked with the Archive file attribute) in each directory they
scan. If the CHKLIST.MS file has a Read-Only, System, or Hidden file attribute,
certain Anti-Virus functions do not work.

CAUSE
=====

When a file (such as CONFIG.SYS) changes, Anti-Virus detects the change and asks
to update the file. If the file has a Read-Only, System, or Hidden attribute,
Anti-Virus does not update the CHKLIST.MS file even if you choose to update it.

This problem also occurs on network drives when you do not have write privileges
to a directory Anti-Virus is scanning.

If the CHKLIST.MS files have the Read-Only attribute set when you choose Delete
CHKLIST Files, the files are not deleted; however, Microsoft Anti-Virus gives no
indication that the files were not deleted. System and Hidden attributes have no
effect on this process.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove any Read-Only, Hidden, or System file
attributes from the CHKLIST.MS files. If you are scanning a network drive, you
must have write privileges to all directories scanned by Anti-Virus.
