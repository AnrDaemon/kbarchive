   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Schedule+ 7.x after you specify group-enabled mode, the splash
screen appears and then the program stops responding (hangs).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when you first install Schedule+ 7.x if you select
Group-enabled mode instead of Standalone mode and if you also specify that you
do not want the mode-selection dialog box to appear again. Schedule+ hangs when
it tries to start because it is trying to detect a nonexistent mailbox.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this behavior, modify two registry values to enable the mode-selection
dialog box for Schedule+:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the MailDisabled value under the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Schedule+\Application

3. On the Edit menu, click DWORD, type "0" (without the quotation marks), and
   then click OK.

4. Locate the MAPIPresent value under the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Schedule+\Application

5. On the Edit menu, click DWORD, type "0" (without the quotation marks), and
   then click OK.

6. Quit Registry Editor.

7. Start Schedule+, and in the relevant dialog box, click Standalone mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To toggle between Group-enabled mode and Standalone mode:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the MailDisabled value under the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Schedule+\Application

3. On the Edit menu, click DWORD, type "0" (without the quotation marks), and
   then click OK, or if the value is already 0, change it to 1.

4. Quit Registry Editor.
