The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT, versions (all versions and editions), 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After a user submits a Web-based form to search a database, he or she may

   Database error: Object required

   -or-

   Server object error 'ASP 0177 : 800401f3' Server.CreateObject Failed <file
   name>, line 99 Invalid class string


CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when you do the following:

1. You install Microsoft FrontPage 98 Server Extensions on a Web server.

2. You create an Active Server Pages (ASP) form with FrontPage 98 to search a
   database on the server.

3. You upgrade the Web server to Microsoft FrontPage 2000 Server Extensions.

This behavior occurs because FrontPage 2000 Server Extensions require an updated
version of Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, download and install the latest version of MDAC, and then
restart the computer. The latest version of MDAC is available at the following
Microsoft Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/data/

MORE INFORMATION
================

FrontPage 2000 Server Extensions require MDAC version 2.1 or later.

FrontPage 2000 Server Extensions can be downloaded from the following Microsoft
Web site:
