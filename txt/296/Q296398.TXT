PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbClient kbConfig kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbOSNovell

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) on a
client that is running Intranetware 4.71 or 4.8, the Spoolsv.exe utility starts
to consume a lot of memory during a hardware inventory cycle. Eventually, you
receive an error message that states that the workstation is running low on
virtual memory.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because of a known issue that is caused by the Novell file,
Nwspool.dll.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, obtain and install an updated version of
Nwspool.dll, which you can obtain in following two Novell knowledge base
articles:

   Novell TID 10059191

   Novell TID 10053738

The third-party contact information included in this article is provided to help

third-party contact information.

The following information is an excerpt from Novell TID 10053738:

   This issue has been addressed in NWSPOOL.DLL build 28NOV2000 or later 
   for the Novell Client 4.8 for Windows NT/2000. Currently the NWSPOOL.DLL
   28NOV2000 build for the Novell Client 4.8 for Windows NT/2000 is available
   as 250903.EXE from the Novell Support Connection file finder. Note this
   file is available as-is and is continuing to receive regression testing.

Note: In SMS SP3, the Sms_def.mof file enumerates the Win32_VideoController class
by default to enable hardware inventory to capture video card information for
all multiple-video card clients. If you need to resolve this issue to upgrade
your Nwspool.dll file, disable the Win32_VideoController class within the
Sms_def.mof file, which you can find on the site server prior to the Nwspool.dll
upgrade.

You can find the Sms_def.mof file in the Sms\Inboxes\Clifiles.src\Hinv folder on
the site server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To modify the Sms_def.mof file, use the Mofman.exe utility that is included in
the Support.exe bundle in SMS SP2, or make the following modifications by using
a text editor, such as NotePad:

To Use Mofman.exe
-----------------

1. Make a backup copy of your present Sms_def.mof file.

2. Run the Mofman utility.

3. Open the Sms_def.mof file, which you can find in the
   Sms\Inboxes\Clifiles.src\Hinv folder on the site server.

4. Expand \\root\\cimv2\\sms.

5. Scroll down to Win32_VideoController and then click it once.

6. After it is selected, click No next to Report.

7. Save the file.

To Make the Changes in NotePad
------------------------------

1. Make a backup copy of your present Sms_def.mof file.

2. In NotePad, open the Sms_def.mof file.

3. Search for Win32_VideoController.

4. Four lines above Win32_VideoController, you see an SMS_REPORT statement;
   change the TRUE value to FALSE.

5. Save the file. The modified section should look like the following sample:

   [SMS_Report(false),
   SMS_Group_Name("Video Controller"),
   ResID(7200),ResDLL("SMS_RXPL.dll"),
   SMS_Class_ID("MICROSOFT|VIDEO_CONTROLLER|1.0")]
   class Win32_VideoController : SMS_Class_Template

6. Run the following command from a command prompt in the
   Sms\Inboxes\Clifiles\Hinv path to check the integrity of the changes:

   mofcomp -check sms_def.mof
