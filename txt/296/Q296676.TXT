KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbvfp KbDBFDBC kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbvfp700fix kbvfp700

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The STATUS BAR is off and SET TALK is on. You issue a REINDEX command against a
large table with seven or more index tags. The REINDEX command echoes
information to the desktop. This information may contain unreadable characters.

STATUS
======

This problem was corrected in Visual FoxPro version 7.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The unreadable characters do not always appear in the reindexing information.
This behavior depends on numerous variables. For example, depending on the
record size, the table may need more than 175,000 records. The index must
contain at least seven or more index tags. The amount of RAM on the computer and
the speed of the processor also affect whether the unreadable characters appear
or not.

1. In the Command window, issue the following commands:

   SET STATUS BAR OFF 
   SET TALK ON

2. Open a large table that has seven or more index tags.

3. In the Command window, issue the following command:

   REINDEX

Note that the information that appears on the FoxPro desktop may contain various
unreadable characters.
