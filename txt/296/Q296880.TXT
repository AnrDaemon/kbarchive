TITLE   :XFOR: Messages Sent by Lotus Notes to Exchange Appear in Badmail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbExchange550

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send messages from any Lotus Notes client of Domino Server version
R5.0.4 through the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes to Exchange
Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 or 4 (SP3 or SP4) recipients, the messages may be
redirected to the Badmail folder.

This situation can occur if the Lotus Notes client is installed on the Exchange
5.5 Server that is hosting the connector, and you are mailing from Lotus Notes
through Domino Server version R5.0.4 to the connector-hosting Exchange 5.5
server while the server is running McAfee GroupShield Exchange 4.5.

This situation occurs only if you have downloaded and installed the post-SP3
Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes hotfix, q256032engi.exe, or if you have
installed SP4 for Exchange Server.

When messages pass through the connector and arrive in the Exchange Server
Badmail folder, the following information may be recorded in the connectivity
administrator's Browse log:

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you run McAfee GroupShield Exchange 4.5 on the
Exchange Server while GroupShield is scanning the Exchange Notes Connector's
x.400 Application Programming Interface (XAPI) mailbox.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, do one of the following:

 - Turn off GroupShield Exchange 4.5.

 - Apply the latest version of GroupShield Exchange.

 - Configure GroupShield to exclude the Exchange Notes Connector's XAPI mailbox
   from scans.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can view the contents of the Badmail folder on the Queues tab of the
properties dialog box for Exchange Notes Connector. You can view more detailed
message properties if you open the Badmail folder with the GWClient utility.

The affected versions of the Exchange Notes Connector include versions 2652.0
through 2653.11. Check the properties of the Lsdxa.exe file to determine the
version.
