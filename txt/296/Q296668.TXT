KEYWORDS:kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to log on to a secure Web site, you may receive the following error
message:

   You are not authorized to view this page

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur when you are a member of a local users group, and you
attempt to access a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) application. Because CGI
applications run on the server, they require Microsoft Windows NT Server domain
authentication.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, turn off Integrated Windows authentication (formerly
called Windows NT Challenge/Response), and then enable Basic authentication. To
do this, follow these steps.

WARNING: Basic authentication is sent in clear text. User names and passwords may
be vulnerable to hackers.

1. Start the Internet Services Manager on your Web server.

2. Right-click your Web site, and then click Properties on the shortcut menu.

3. On the Directory Security tab, click Edit in the "Anonymous Access and
   Authentication Control" area.

4. Click to select the Basic Authentication check box.

5. Click to clear the "Integrated Windows authentication" check box.

   NOTE: Your Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) server may refer to
   the Windows NT Challenge/Response authentication method. If this is the case,
   click to clear the "Windows NT Challenge/Response" check box.

6. Click OK twice.
