   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

With User Manager, when you attempt to add users or global groups from a trusted
Windows 2000 domain (on a Windows NT 4.0 domain controller) to a local group in
the Windows NT 4.0 domain, you may receive the following error message:

   Unable to browse the selected domain because the following error occurred:

   There are currently no logon servers available to service the logon request.

Also, you may observe in User Manager that existing users and groups from the
Windows 2000 domain, which are members of domain local groups, are displayed as
"Account Unknown."

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the RestrictAnonymous registry value is set to
Level 2 on the Windows 2000 domain controller on which the Windows NT 4.0-based
computer has its secure channel.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this behavior:

1. Set the RestrictAnonymous registry value to 0 or 1 on the Windows 2000 domain
   controller. This registry value can be found at:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa

   Value: RestrictAnonymous
   Value Type: REG_DWORD
   Value Data: 0x1 or 0x0(Hex)

2. Restart the domain controller.

3. Break, and then reestablish the trust.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The RestrictAnonymous registry value with a Level 2 setting must only be used in
"pure" Windows 2000 environments.
