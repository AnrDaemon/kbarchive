TITLE   :SMS: Delay When You Try to Delete Collections
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms200preSP4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click "Yes, I want to see more information" and then delete a
collection in the Systems Management Server (SMS) Administrator console, a delay
may occur before the next dialog box that displays related subcollections is
displayed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the SMS Administrator console enumerates all
existing collections in the database to determine if any other collections have
a link to the collection that you are deleting. As a result, there is a longer
delay when there is a large number of collections.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, not click "Yes, I want to see more information",
instead, click "No, I know I want to delete this collection". However, when you
click "Yes, I want to see more information", you are not prompted about the
subcollections, advertisements, queries, collection membership rules, and
administrators that will be effected.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
