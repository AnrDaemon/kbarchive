TITLE   :Setting the MaxFailedObjects Key in Microsoft Directory Synchron
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Services for NetWare version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If MSDSS does not migrate a specific object in an otherwise successful directory
synchronization, The service writes 150 objects, and then it records the
following event message in the local System log:

   MSDSS Event ID: 46
   The maximum number of failed objects (150) have been added to the failed
   object list The session has teminated. to allow more entries to be added,
   please increase the value of the 'MaxFailedObjects' key in the Dirsync
   registry parameters setting.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because MSDSS defaults to writing 150 records if a specific
object is not successfully added during a directory synchronization.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, you can overwrite the default setting by modifying the
MaxFailedObjects registry setting. The key that you need to add is in the MSDSS
registry key, and not the Dirsync key (as indicated in the event message). The
correct registry entry is:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSDSS\Parameters\
   Value: MaxFailedObjects
   Type: DWORD

You need to add this entry by using Regedt32.exe because it does not exist by
default.

If the MaxFailedObject key is set to 0, MSDSS continues to write all records if a
single object does not migrate.
