TITLE   :User Accounts Are Not Excluded from Password Synchronization
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The user accounts that are supposed to be excluded by the Password
Synchronization feature may not be excluded, and password changes to these
accounts may occur unexpectedly.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if a UNIX administrator adds the "SYNC_USERS=-root -pat"
line to the Sso.conf file so that all user passwords are synchronized, except
for the "root" and "pat" user passwords. However, the exclude delimiter, the
minus (-) symbol, is ignored (not recognized), which enables Password
Synchronization to occur for the "root" and "pat" user passwords.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

 - Explicitly list the users in the Sso.conf file by using the SYNC_USERS field.
   The plus (+) symbol delimiter is used to explicitly add a user, for example:

   SYNC_USERS=+fred +leon +ralph

 - Add the excluded users to a special group called "PasswordPropDeny" in either
   Microsoft Windows 2000 or Microsoft Windows NT. These users can be added by
   using Active Directory Users and Computers in a Windows 2000 domain or User
   Manager on a Windows NT 4.0 domain.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
