TITLE   :SNA Server DLC Connection Fails Through Cisco DLSw and VLAN
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::3.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport sna4 tslic_tslic

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Data Link Control (DLC) connection is activated in SNA Server or Host
Integration Server (HIS) 2000 and the connection is through a Cisco Systems
router that is implementing Data Link Switching (DLSw) (DLC protocol tunneled in
IP) in a virtual LAN (VLAN) Ethernet environment, the connection attempt may
fail. The application event log may post an event 230, "remote station not
responding." If the VLAN software is shut down so only DLSw is operational, the
connection attempt will be successful. If several Host Integration Server 2000
or SNA Server servers are on one segment, another symptom is that some but not
all of the servers will connect, but not the same servers each time.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server or Host Integration Server 2000 is sending polls to the destination
address specified in the connection configuration, but no response is returned
from the destination.

RESOLUTION
==========

Update the Cisco routers that are implementing the VLAN and switching "fabric"
to IOS release 12.1.6.
