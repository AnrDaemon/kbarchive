OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Schedule+ and you then open a profile or create a new profile for
Microsoft Exchange Client (Inbox), the following error message may appear:

   Mapisp32 caused an invalid page fault in module kernel32.dll

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Mapi32.dll file has become damaged, possibly
because Windows Messaging might already have been reinstalled one or more times.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, rename the Mapi32.dll file, and then remove and
reinstall Windows Messaging:

1. In Windows Explorer, locate the Mapi32.dll file, and then rename it to
   Mapi32.old.

2. Locate the MSMail.inf file in the \Windows\Inf folder, and then copy the file
   to your desktop.

3. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

4. Double-click Add/Remove Programs, and then click the Windows Setup tab.

5. Click Have Disk, and then click Browse.

6. Browse through the folder list to locate the MSMail.inf file that you copied
   to your desktop.

7. Click OK, and then click OK again.
