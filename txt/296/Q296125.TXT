DOCUMENT:Q296125  27-FEB-2002  [iis]
TITLE   :Error Calling IsInherited Attribute of GetPropertyAttribObj
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you reference the IsInherited attribute of the IIS Admin Object
GetPropertyAttribObj method, you may receive the following error message:

   Object doesn't support this property or method: 'objIIS.IsInterited'
   0x800A01B6

NOTE: The error code may also be displayed as 438 or 1B6, depending on the
environment that the GetPropertyAttribObj object was instantiated in and the
error code formatting that is being used.

CAUSE
=====

The IIS 5.0 product documentation incorrectly refers to the attribute as
IsInherited, when the correct name is IsInherit. The correct information is
listed below:

+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Attribute | Description                                    | 
+------------------------------------------------------------+
| IsInherit | Specifies whether the property is inheritable. | 
+------------------------------------------------------------+

WORKAROUND
==========

Use objIIS.Inherit instead of objIIS.Inherited to reference the attribute.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Services version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem does not affect IIS 4.0 because the GetPropertyAttribObj method is
not available with the NT Option Pack, which is the installation vehicle for IIS
4.0.

To programmatically obtain information about property inheritance in IIS 4.0 (or
for an additional workaround in IIS 5.0), see the GetDataPaths method sample
available from the following Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Web site:

   http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?URL=/library/psdk/iisref/adsi52wj.htm

If your computer has the IIS 4.0 product documentation installed, you can also
obtain information about property inheritance in IIS 4.0 by viewing the IIS
schema sample at the following Web site:

   http://localhost/iishelp/iis/htm/sdk/aoii09bh.htm

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

On an IIS 5.0 server, create a file called Inherit.vbs, and paste the following
sample code into that file:

   On Error Resume Next
   Set objIIS = GetObject("IIS://localhost/W3SVC/1/ROOT")
   Set objAttrib = objIIS.GetPropertyAttribObj("ScriptMaps")
   WScript.Echo 
   WScript.Echo "The following properties are set for " & objAttrib.PropName 
   WScript.Echo
   WScript.Echo "    Inherit = " & objAttrib.Inherit
   WScript.Echo "    IsInherit = " & objAttrib.IsInherited

   If Err.Number <> 0 Then
      WScript.Echo
      WScript.Echo "  VBScript Error " & Hex(Err.Number) & ": " & Err.Description
   End If

If you replace objAttrib.IsInherited in the sample code with objAttrib.IsInherit,
you receive the correct result.
