TITLE   :SMS: Access Violation Errors During SQL Server Upgrade
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbsetup kbDatabase kbServer kbsms200 kbUpgrade

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform a service pack upgrade to a Microsoft SQL Server that is a
Systems Management Server (SMS) Site Database server, the SMS Executive service
may generate an "Access Violation" error and log the following entries
repetitively:

Compsumm.log:

   Error: Could not get a SQL connection from the connection cache. Will try
   again in 60 seconds. : The handle is invalid.~~

Sitestat.log:

   Error: Could not get a SQL connection from the connection cache. Will try
   again in 60 seconds. : The handle is invalid.~~
   ---->: This is a Primary Site, the datastore is SQL

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because during a SQL Server service pack upgrade, the
MSSQLSERVER service restarts in single-user mode, which disconnects any
processes that are currently connected to the SQL Server databases and which
does not allow them access to any database objects until the upgrade is
complete.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, on the SMS Site server, manually stop the
SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER service, the SMS_EXECUTIVE service, and the
SMS_SQL_MONITOR service prior to performing the SQL Server service pack upgrade.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sites may stop and cease to function until you manually restart the services if
you do not stop them prior to any SQL upgrades. Microsoft recommends that you
always shut down the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER service, the SMS_EXECUTIVE, and
the SMS_SQL_MONITOR service before you perform a SQL Server upgrade.
