======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to legal-size paper from Microsoft Windows, the document appears
to have a section missing at the top and the bottom of the page or it prints a
single page on two sheets of paper.

CAUSE
=====

 - You may need to select legal-size paper in the Printers setup option of
   Windows Control Panel.

-or-

 - Your printer has a line-counting feature that defaults to 8.5 x 11 inches and
   causes this problem.

WORKAROUND
==========

Make sure that legal-size paper has been selected from Printers setup"

1. Start Windows Control Panel.

2. Select Printers, then choose Configure.

3. Choose Setup and select legal-size paper.

If the problem continues, try turning off the auto-formfeed on the printer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Formfeed on most printers defaults to an 8.5 x 11 inch sheet of paper. The
printer is counting the number of lines it has printed, not how long the paper
is. This might occur on any printer that has the option to print to legal-size
paper.

On laser printers and DeskJet printers, the output look like a section of it has
been cut off at the top and the bottom. On a dot-matrix printer, the output will
appear on two separate pages, if the paper is continuous feed.
