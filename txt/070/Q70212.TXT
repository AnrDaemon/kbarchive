The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Using the SETUP /N command to set up Microsoft Windows or Windows for Workgroups
on a Novell NetWare workstation may fail if the Setup program is directed to an
existing directory that has been mapped with the MAP command instead of using
the MAP ROOT command.

When the ROOT MAP command is not used, the following error message is displayed:

   ERROR #110 Cannot write to WIN.INI...

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the pre-existing directory is made a "mapped" drive under a directory where
the user has no rights, Setup may:

1. Return an

   unknown file copy error

   message.

2. Attempt to create a "standalone" installation, replete with a system
   subdirectory.

3. Stop responding (hang) when shifting to the graphics mode.

If the user has no rights in the subdirectory above the destination directory,
the MAP ROOT command must be used.

The proper syntax is the same as used with the MAP command.

Example
-------

   MAP ROOT H:=SERVER1\SYS:USER\JIM
