TITLE   :Windows Err Msg: Cannot Find KRNLxxx.EXE
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0a,3.1,3.11,95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win31 win95 win98

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive one of the following error messages when you try to start
Windows or Windows for Workgroups:

   Cannot find KRNL386.EXE

   Cannot find KRNL286.EXE

   Cannot find KRNL.EXE (version 3.0 only)

   Cannot find or load required file KRNL386.EXE. The file was not found.

CAUSE
=====

These messages indicate that Windows cannot find the kernel necessary to run 386
enhanced, standard, or real mode (version 3.0 only). The kernel provides system
services such as memory and resource management.

This problem can also occur if the WIN386.EXE file is located in the Windows
folder. This file is run by WIN.COM, causing Windows to belive the Windows
folder is the Windows\System folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two methods for resolving this issue.

If Windows 95/98 Was Not Installed/Uninstalled
----------------------------------------------

1. Boot with clean AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files.

2. Make sure that your Windows directory is on your MS-DOS path.

3. Make sure that your path statement does not contain more than 128 characters.

4. Make sure that the correct kernel file indicated in the warning message
   actually exists in your Windows SYSTEM subdirectory. If you are running a
   shared copy of Windows, make sure the file is in the shared Windows
   directory.

5. Add the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory to your MS-DOS path.

6. Make sure your MS-DOS version is compatible with your computer.

7. If you are using a shared installation of Windows on a network server, make
   sure that your personal Windows directory and the shared Windows directory
   are on your MS-DOS path and are listed in that order.

8. Ensure you don't have any upper memory block (UMB) conflicts. For more
   information, query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   troubleshooting and emm386.exe 4.45

9. Rebuild the SYSTEM.INI file.

10. As a last resort, reinstall Windows.

If Windows 95/98 Was Installed/Uninstalled
------------------------------------------

1. Remove the WIN386.EXE file from the Windows folder. If there is no WIN386.EXE
   file in the Windows\System folder, move the file from the Windows folder to
   the Windows\System folder.

2. Restart the computer.

3. If these steps do not solve the problem, use the steps in the "If Windows
   95/98 Was Not Installed/Uninstalled" section.
