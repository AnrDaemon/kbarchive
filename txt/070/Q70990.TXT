KEYWORDS:kbdta winword word97 kbtablekbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the result of a formula is too long (wide) to fit within a table cell,
Microsoft Word displays "Error!" in the table cell.

Text that is typed within a cell will wrap when the end of the cell is reached.
However, this is not true for the results of formulas that are entered into
table cells.

For example:

{eq \F(10000,45345)}

CAUSE
=====

The width of the table cell needs to be wide enough to accommodate the result of
the entered formula.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the width of the table cell is set to 0.5 inch, the sample formula in the
"Symptoms" section of this article will result in an "Error!" message. If the
width of the cell is increased, the following fraction will appear:

   10000
   -----
   45345

Additional query words: divisible squished wordwrap 97
