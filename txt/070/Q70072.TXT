The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A corrupt RES file may cause the Dialog Editor distributed with the Windows
Software Development Kit (SDK) to crash. If the Dialog Editor crashes
consistently processing a particular file, delete the RES file created by the
Dialog Editor and use the resource compiler to recompile the DLG dialog script
file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To compile the DLG dialog script file, you must include WINDOWS.H at the top of
the script. You must make the following line the first line in your DLG file:

      #include <windows.h>

To compile the dialog script file using the resource compiler, use the following
command line:

   rc mydlg.dlg

where "mydlg" is replaced with the name of the dialog script file. This will
produce a RES file that can be used by the Dialog Editor and should help to
alleviate the crashing problems.
