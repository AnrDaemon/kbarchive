SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience video display problems when you run Microsoft Windows version
3.0 on an Epson 286 or 386SX laptop. Windows may appear to extend past the
boundaries of the monitor. This problem usually occurs when you use the built-in
LCD display, but may also occur if you are connected to an external EGA or VGA
monitor.

RESOLUTION
==========

Epson has a Windows video device driver, called LTWIN.DRV, that corrects this
problem. This device driver is available from Epson dealers or the Epson
technical support bulletin board service (BBS).

This driver is only for the LT386SX machine. It is used to correct display
problems with Windows 386, Windows 3.0, and OS/2 version 1.1. The driver is
available on CompuServe forums for Epson. The driver file is self- extracting
and includes readme files.
