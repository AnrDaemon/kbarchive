The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a

SUMMARY
=======

If you have group files ordered incorrectly within the [Groups] section of the
file PROGMAN.INI, only some or no groups may appear in Program Manager.

There are two possible causes why the contents of the [Groups] section in the
PROGMAN.INI file can become invalid:

1. The PROGMAN.INI file was manually modified incorrectly.

2. The PROGMAN.INI file was corrupted.

In PROGMAN.INI, group files (that is, "Group(number)=" statements must be in
sequential order within the [Groups] section; however, the associated files
("group path" statements) may appear in any order.

The PROGMAN.INI file is an ASCII text file and can be viewed using Windows
Notepad, any standard text editor, or by using the MS-DOS TYPE command at the
command line [that is, type "type progman.ini" (without the quotation marks),
then press ENTER].

MORE INFORMATION
================

The [Groups] section contains the information necessary for Program Manager to
locate the group files that are currently being used in Program Manager. Below
is a list of the default [Groups] section that is created during installation
without scanning the hard drive for existing applications:

      [Groups]

      Group1=C:\WINDOWS\ACCESSOR.GRP
      Group2=C:\WINDOWS\GAMES.GRP
      Group3=C:\WINDOWS\MAIN.GRP

The following examples illustrate a valid [Groups] section, where <group
path> represents the path to the group file:

      Group1=<group path>
      Group2=<group path>
      Group3=<group path>
      Group4=<group path>

-or-

      Group1=<group path>
      Group3=<group path>
      Group2=<group path>
      Group4=<group path>

The following example illustrates an invalid [Groups] section that causes the
Main group not to appear. Note this example does NOT produce an error message
when Windows starts.

      [Groups]
      Group1=C:\WINDOWS\ACCESSOR.GRP
      Group2=C:\WINDOWS\GAMES.GRP
      Group4=C:\WINDOWS\MAIN.GRP
