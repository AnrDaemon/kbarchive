SUMMARY
=======

When Tetris for Microsoft Windows 3.0 starts, it turns off the NUM LOCK key if
this key is enabled. Tetris requires that the NUM LOCK key be turned off for
proper operation of the keys on the numeric keypad. The NUM LOCK key's state is
not restored when you exit Tetris. The NUM LOCK key must be pressed again to
reenable it.

Some OEM versions of DOS and keyboard BIOS may not accept the function Tetris
uses to turn off the NUM LOCK key. In addition, there is a problem that occurs
with DOS applications and the NUM LOCK key after exiting Tetris for Windows. If
the NUM LOCK key is on, it is turned off when executing any MS-DOS applications.
Windows applications are not affected.

WORKAROUND
==========

Manually turn off the NUM LOCK key before Tetris is executed, and keep it off
until play is finished with Tetris. Press the NUM LOCK key on before starting
MS-DOS applications.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the NUM LOCK key is automatically toggled off after exiting your MS-DOS
applications, it may take more than one press before the NUM LOCK key is
actually enabled again. This problem consistently occurs only on computers
configured with MS-DOS versions 4.01 and earlier. It does not occur with later
versions of MS-DOS.
