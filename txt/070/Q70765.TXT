SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to identify an MS-DOS session that has been started from inside
of Windows. This requires the use of a batch file to change the prompt. The
MS-DOS ANSI.SYS driver can be used to enhance the appearance of the prompt once
initiated.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Changing the prompt can be done through the use of a batch file that invokes a
prompt command. The following batch file has been used successfully:

      @echo off
      prompt Windows Prompt $p$g
      command

This batch file causes a prompt that looks like "Windows Prompt C:\WINDOWS>"
to be displayed. This prompt draws attention to the fact that the MS-DOS session
has been invoked from inside of Windows, which can be beneficial in some
instances.

This batch file can replace the MS-DOS Prompt icon's Properties from the Main
Group of Program Manager. Simply replace COMMAND.COM with:

   batch_file_name.BAT

The Prompt command can be enhanced through the use of ANSI.SYS to add color or
blinking text to further draw attention. For more information about ANSI.SYS,
please refer to your MS-DOS manual.
