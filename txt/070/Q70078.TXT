SUMMARY
=======

When CodeView for Windows (CVW) loads an EXE or DLL file, by default, CVW looks
for the source code files in the same directory. If CVW cannot find the source
files, it will prompt for the file location(s) with a dialog box. Complete
pathnames can then be added to direct CVW to the correct source directory.

To prevent CVW from prompting for alternate directories, two methods can be
used:

1. Add the path information to the source module on the C Compiler command line.

-or-

2. Change the default directory prior to invoking CVW.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two methods that can be used to prevent CVW from displaying a dialog
box to get pathnames to source files:

1. Add the path information to the source module on the C compiler command line
   in the makefile. The compiler will place the path information in the OBJ
   file. The linker preserves this information and makes it available to CVW. A
   typical makefile change might look similar to the following:

   cl -Gw -W3 -Zpi -Od myapp.c

   is changed to

   cl -Gw -W3 -Zpi -Od c:\windev\c\myapp.c

2. Change the default directory for CVW by "setting the path" to the source
   directory before starting CVW. Do this by starting the MS-DOS Executive (from
   the Program Manager's File menu, choose Run and enter "msdos" as the
   application to execute). Then, select the directory containing the EXE file
   and source files. This sets the default directory. Start CVW using the File
   Run command. Enter "cvw <optional parameters>" as the application to
   execute.
