======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The error

   Cannot Start Runtime ToolBook without a BOOK.
   You must specify a ToolBook Application

is generated if the TBOOK.EXE file is executed without a *.TBK file specified as
a parameter and the ToolBook section of the WIN.INI file has been altered so
that there is no default startup book specified.

WORKAROUND
==========

Select the ToolBook icon and check the Command Line selection (choose Properties
from the File menu) on the menu to ensure that a *.TBK file is loaded like one
of the samples below:

   C:\TOOLBOOK\TBOOK.EXE C:\TOOLBOOK\DAYBOOK.TBK

   -or-

   C:\TOOLBOOK\DAYBOOK.TBK
   (Assuming *.TBK is associated to TBOOK.EXE in the WIN.INI file)

MORE INFORMATION
================

ToolBook installs an entry in the WIN.INI file similar to:

      [ToolBook]
      startupUnits=inches
      startupHeight=5760
      startupWidth=8640
      startupSysColors=true
      startupSysBooks=
      startupBook=tourbook.tbk

In the sample above, the "startupBook=tourbook" line causes ToolBook to default
to the TourBook application when TBOOK.EXE is executed.

If the line reads

   startupBook=

no application is provided when TBOOK.EXE is executed and an error message
results.

This line may be altered to substitute any ToolBook application for:

   tourbook.tbk

NOTE: The full version of ToolBook, which has the executable file TOOLBOOK.EXE,
loads without a any *.TBK or startup book specified. The full version of
ToolBook will load a new authoring screen if it is loaded without a specified
book or a default startup book.
