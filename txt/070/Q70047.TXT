The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When using Terminal for null modem communications, you must set the
Connector field to match the communications port to which the null
modem cable is connected.

The "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version 3.0 incorrectly states on
page 328 that "If you are using a null modem, select None" for the
Connector field of the Communications dialog box under the Settings menu of
Terminal. If the Connector is set to None, Terminal cannot send or receive
data.

This documentation error does not occur in later versions of Windows.
