SUMMARY
=======

ATI Technologies has reported that the following two ATI video drivers do not
work properly with Microsoft Windows version 3.0 and should be removed from the
CONFIG.SYS file:

 - ATIVIDEO.SYS

 - ROMBIOS.SYS

MORE INFORMATION
================

ATI uses the drivers ATIVIDEO.SYS and ROMBIOS.SYS to shadow the video BIOS from
read only memory (ROM) into random access memory (RAM)

Video or ROM shadowing is when the instructions contained on the ROM chip are
copied to the RAM chip at bootup. Accessing RAM is faster than accessing ROM,
and shadowing the video BIOS into RAM increases the speed of the screen writes.

ATI recommends taking these drivers out of CONFIG.SYS for other reasons, also. If
you have a 286 or 386 system, your machine may have the capability to provide
these features in the system setup of your machine. This procedure does not use
valuable conventional memory for these settings such as loading the drivers in
the CONFIG.SYS does.

For more information, contact ATI technical support.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these product's performance
or reliability.
