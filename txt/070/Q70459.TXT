SUMMARY
=======

You cannot load graphics created in formats such as TIFF or HPGL in Microsoft
Windows Paintbrush or paste text into Paintbrush.

You can work around this problem by copying the graphics or text to the Clipboard
(using ALT+PRINT SCREEN) and pasting the image into Paintbrush.

NOTE: Text pasted into Paintbrush using this procedure cannot be edited later. In
addition, this procedure works only if the graphic or text selection is smaller
than full screen.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To copy a picture or text into Paintbrush:

1. Start the source application and maximize the application (full screen).

2. Press ALT+PRINT SCREEN to copy the entire program screen to the Clipboard as
   a Windows bitmap.

3. Minimize or close the source application.

4. Start and maximize Paintbrush.

5. From the View menu, choose Zoom Out. This creates a full-page view of the
   Paintbrush screen.

6. From the Edit menu, choose Paste. This displays a diagonal grid on the
   screen.

7. From the Edit menu, choose Paste again. The image appears with the diagonal
   grid on top of the image.

8. From the View menu, choose Zoom In. This clears the diagonal lines from the
   image.
