Sanyo has confirmed that the Microsoft Learning MS-DOS tutorial program hangs on
the Sanyo Laptop, model 16NB. This system has an 8088 processor and 640 x 200
Supertwist LCD video. When attempting to load Learning MS-DOS on this computer,
the copyright screen is displayed, the screen goes blank, and the computer is
hung and must be rebooted.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Learning MS-DOS version 2.00. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
