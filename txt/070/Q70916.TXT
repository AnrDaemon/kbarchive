-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the MS-DOS version 5.0 or later QBasic SCREEN command to set the
screen to mode 13 (320 x 200, 256-color resolution) on a Tandon Laptop 386 with
a VGA card, meaningless characters may appear on the screen. When running in
this mode, the VGA card ignores requests to set colors; therefore, anything
displayed on the screen appears in unpredictable colors.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by a problem in the VGA card itself, not the machine,
monitor, or Qbasic.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
or reliability.
