The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You try to use QRAM.SYS with Windows 3.0 on a 386 machine and the following
error message is displayed:

   Extended memory manager already present

CAUSE
=====

The entries in your CONFIG.SYS file are in the wrong order.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the problem, place HIMEM.SYS before QRAM.SYS in the CONFIG.SYS file.
HIMEM.SYS mistakes QRAM.SYS for an extended memory manager.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Quarterdeck's QRAM program is an expanded memory manager for 286-based
machines.

NOTE: Quarterdeck also ships QEXT.SYS with QRAM for 286 machines. This extended
memory manager should not be used with Windows 3.0.
