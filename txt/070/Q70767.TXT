 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a

SUMMARY
=======

According to Zeos technical support, when you install Microsoft Windows 3.0 on
most Zeos machines, you must configure the mouse for COM1 or Microsoft Windows
Setup will hang when reading Windows Disk 2.

WORKAROUND
==========

During Windows Setup, install for "No Mouse or other pointing device" and change
it later, or install the mouse on COM1 before installing Windows 3.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Also according to Zeos technical support, most Zeos machines have the ability to
enable shadow RAM, but they are normally shipped with shadow RAM disabled. To
determine the status of shadow RAM, run the CMOS Setup Utility by pressing
CTRL+ALT+ESC immediately after bootup. The shadow RAM status will either be on
the first screen (if it's AMI or Phoenix BIOS) or second screen (if it's Award
BIOS [only on some newer SX models]).
