======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When it is enumerating instances of the SMS_Advertisement Windows Management
Instrumentation (WMI) class, the SMS provider can cause a leak in private bytes
of the Winmgmt service.

CAUSE
=====

This leak can occur when mandatory assignments are used in the advertisement's
schedule. If advertisements contain one or more mandatory assignments, a leak in
Winmgmt private bytes occurs when the Advertisements node is refreshed in the
SMS Administration console.

Additionally, custom programs that use the Microsoft Systems Management Server
(SMS) Software Development Kit (SDK) to enumerate or poll the SMS_Advertisement
WMI class can cause this leak to occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article

   Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
   Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although the leak is small (about 36 bytes per advertisement that contains a
single mandatory assignment schedule), the leak can be increased by the heavy
use of mandatory assignments and many advertisements.
