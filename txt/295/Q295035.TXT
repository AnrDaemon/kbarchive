TITLE   :SMS: Charting in Web Reporting Tool Requires Office Run Locally
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg kbtool kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Charting option in the Systems Management Server (SMS) Web
Reporting tool, you may receive the following error message:

   Charting requires Office 2000 on the client machine.

You may receive this error message even if Microsoft Office 2000 components are
installed on the local computer.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the SMS Web Reporting tool is calling the Office
2000 components by class ID. When this occurs, the "install on demand" feature
of MSI does not start, so the feature does not become available.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this issue, run Office 2000 Setup by using the Add/Remove Programs
tool in Control Panel, and set Office Web Components (under Office Shared
Features) to run locally.

MORE INFORMATION
