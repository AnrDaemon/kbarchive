-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you set the code page in an ASP script to UTF-8 (either by using
@CodePage=65001 or Session.CodePage=65001), the characters may be mismatched and
the output does not match the expected results.

CAUSE
=====

The encoding format of the ASP file page must be the same as the @CodePage used
in the page.

RESOLUTION
==========

Save the file with the UTF-8 encoding setting. The version of Notepad that is
included in Windows 2000 or later has the option to specify an encoding format
when you save a file. For example, if @CodePage is set to 65001, which indicates
UTF-8, you need to save the ASP file with UTF-8 encoding. If @CodePage is set to
1252, which indicates English or German, you need to save the ASP file with ANSI
encoding.
