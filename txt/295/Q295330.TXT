TITLE   :BUG: AV in MSVBVM60.dll Using WinInet .ocx in COM DLL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0,6.0 SP3,6.0 SP4,6.0 SP5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDLL kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0 SP3, 6.0 SP4, 6.0 SP5 
 - Microsoft Windows Internet Services (WinInet) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may encounter an access violation if you unload a form that contains the
WinInet ActiveX control when that form is hosted in a Visual Basic Component
Object Model (COM) dynamic link library (DLL) rather than in the main project.

CAUSE
=====

Under certain conditions, destruction of the loaded WinInet control in a COM DLL
may partially fail. The control creates a hidden window that is used for message
handling. Although the control is successfully unloaded under all conditions,
the hidden window may survive the destruction of the control. Because the
window's callback function is destroyed when the control is unloaded, messages
that are sent to the hidden window result in an access violation.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
it has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to computers
that are experiencing this specific problem.

NOTE: You must have a Visual Studio license agreement to obtain this fix.
