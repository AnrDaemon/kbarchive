   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you remove the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
protocol and restart the server, and then you attempt to reinstall the TCP/IP
protocol, you may receive the following error message:

   Error 2 Loading Registry Information

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if there is an invalid registry key (an orphaned network
adapter registry key).

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this behavior:

1. Locate the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows NT/CurrentVersion/NetworkCards

   NOTE: The adapters are displayed as numbered keys. This registry key may be
   missing all or some of its registry values.

2. Locate the orphaned registry key by comparing it against the other adapter
   registry keys.

3. Delete the invalid key, and then restart the server. The TCP/IP protocol is
   reloaded.
