SYMPTOMS
========

After you run Performance Optimizer in Verbose mode, the information store may
not start. Also, the following 5000, 1120, and 188 events may be logged in the
Application log in Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 1120
   Source: MSExchangeIS
   Description:
   Error 0xfffffad0 initializing the MS Exchange information store database.

   Event ID: 5000
   Source: MSExchangeIS
   Description:
   Unable to initialize the MS Exchange information store service. Error
   0xfffffad0.

   Event ID: 188
   Source: Ese97
   Description:
   MSExchangeIS (359) System parameter stop clean flush threshold (5700) is less
   than start clean flush threshold (9500).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the Buffer Threshold Low Percent value is
missing from the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersSystem

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this behavior, you must add the missing DWORD value in the following
registry location:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersSystem

1. Start the registry editor (Regedit.exe).

2. Open the following subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersSystem

3. Add the DWORD value: Buffer Threshold Low Percent.

4. Add a hexadecimal value of 3.
