SUMMARY
=======

If you try to renew a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Server Certificate from
VeriSign, and you want to generate new keys, the Internet Information Server
(IIS) 5.0 Microsoft Management Console (MMC) tries to connect to your local
Certificate Authority that is configured in your domain. This article explains
how to renew an SSL Server Certificate from VeriSign with a new key set.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a new site in the IIS 5.0 MMC Snap-in.

2. Right-click the new site, and then click Properties.

3. On the Directory Security tab, click Server Certificate to request a new
   certificate.

4. In the Certificate Wizard, retain the same fields as the old certificate so
   that only your private and public keys change.

5. Cut and paste the newly created Certificate Request information to VeriSign.

6. When you receive a text file for your request, process the pending request in
   the IIS 5.0 MMC. To do this, follow these steps:

   a. Right-click the new site, and then click Properties.

   b. On the Directory Security tab, click "Process the pending request and
      install the certificate".

   c. Click the file that you received from VeriSign for your request, and click
      Next. Verify that the values are correct, click Next, and then click
      Finish.

This creates a new certificate with new keys. You can use this certificate for
your old site because the new certificate has the same "Common name" as the old
certificate, so it still matches your server's name.
