TITLE   :XADM: KMS Not Processing New Client Enrollments
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While you are enrolling new clients in advanced security, the client may not
receive a reply from the Key Management server (KM server) verifying a
successful enrollment.

The client forwards the signing public key to the System Attendant mailbox. The
System Attendant then forwards this mail to the KM server for processing.

The client never receives a reply from the KM server verifying enrollment in
advanced security.

CAUSE
=====

The following registry key should match the directory name for the Exchange
Server Organization .

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeSA\Parameters\Enterprise

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor.

2. Go to the following key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeSA\Parameters\Enterprise

3. Right-click the Enterprise key and modify the value to match the directory
   name for your Exchange 5.5 Organization.
