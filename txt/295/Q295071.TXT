SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to backup and restore correlation tables that are
used by SNADS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Exchange Connector for SNADS uses correlation tables to maintain a
mapping of the connector's generated SNADS proxy addresses with the SMTP
addresses for messages that are received from the Internet and bound for SNADS
recipients. It is recommended that you use the procedures described in this
section to back up and restore these tables to prevent SNADS recipients from
being unable to reply to SMTP messages, or to prevent SNADS recipients from
replying to the wrong Internet address.

NOTE: To complete the backup procedure, the Lmetprox.seq file must be intact.

To back up correlation tables, copy the contents of the
<Exchsrvr>\Connect\Exchconn\Tables folder.

To restore correlation tables, replace all of the files in the
<Exchsrvr>\Connect\Exchconn\Tables folder except for the Lmetprox.seq
file; retain the current Lmetprox.seq file. When you do so, the proxy addresses
assigned sequence remains uninterrupted. If Lmetprox.seq is replaced with the
backup file, it is possible that the same SNADS proxy address may be assigned to
two different SMTP addresses. Lmetprox.seq tracks how proxy addresses are
assigned and generated.
