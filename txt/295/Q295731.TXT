TITLE   :XCON:  RPC Fails Between Site Connectors When Servers Use IPX
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use site connectors or multiple servers in a site where Internetwork
Packet Exchange (IPX) is the only protocol that is used, if a Novell Bindery
server does not exist, remote procedure call (RPC) fails between the two servers
that are only using IPX.

Exchange Server RPC over Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX) tries a getaddressbyname
by using bindery lookup. This process fails because a Bindery server is not
available; Service Advertising Protocol (SAP) lookup also fails because an SAP
Agent is not present to respond.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:

 - Enable Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW) on the servers, and then make sure
   that you have a Netware server available that supports bindery functions.
   This method is the preferred method because bindery is more efficient than
   SAP.

   -or-

 - Install GSNW and the SAP Agent on both servers. This method is not the
   preferred method because SAP is essentially a broadcast. However, this method
   is the only method you can use if a Bindery server is not available.
