NOTE: You may receive an error message if you copy and paste the examples
directly from this article to FrontPage. The angle brackets ("<" and ">")
may appear as escaped HTML code ("&lt;" and "&gt;"). To work around this
behavior, paste the script in a blank Notepad document, and then copy it from
Notepad before you paste it into FrontPage.

To add script code to a shared border, follow these steps:

1. Start FrontPage and open the Web site. To do this, click Open Web on the File
   menu, select the Web you want to open, and click Open.

2. On the Tools menu, click Web Settings.

3. Click the Advanced Settings tab. Click to select the "Show hidden files and
   folders" check box and click Apply.

   NOTE: Shared borders are kept in a hidden folder named _borders.

4. If you receive the following message

   The changes you made in the Advanced Settings tab will take effect after the
   Web is refreshed from the server.

   Do you want to refresh the Web now?

   click Yes.

5. Click OK to close the Web Settings dialog box.

6. Double-click the _borders folder.

   NOTE: You should see one or more of the following shared border pages:

    - Top.htm (Top Shared Border)
    - Left.htm (Left Shared Border)
    - Right.htm (Right Shared Border)
    - Bottom.htm (Bottom Shared Border)

   When you edit these files the information that appears in the borders is
   updated.

7. Right-click the file you want to modify and click Open on the menu that
   appears. For example, open the Top.htm page.

8. When the page opens in FrontPage, switch to HTML view.

9. Locate the opening <BODY> tag in the HTML code and click just after the
   tag. Press ENTER twice to create new lines.

   WARNING: Information you type between the <BODY> and </BODY> tags
   in a shared border file appears in the border. Any code that you type in the
   <HEAD></HEAD> section is ignored. Therefore, to have the script
   be processed, place it in the document body section.

10. On the new line, type the script code you want. For example, type the
   following script code:

   <script language="JavaScript">
   <!--
       alert('This is in the TOP border.');
   -->
   </script>

11. On the File menu, click Save to save the changes you made to the page.

12. On the File menu, click Close.

When you view your Web site in a Web browser, a message box similar to the
following appears for each page that has the shared border:

   This is in the TOP border.
