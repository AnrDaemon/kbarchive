SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to break down the System process when you are
monitoring the computer's performance.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you are monitoring the computer's performance to determine the cause of a
bottleneck, or to determine why the computer stopped responding (hangs), the
monitoring results may reveal that the System process consumes a large amount of
processor time. This issue is usually caused by a device driver that is running
in the context of the System process. To break down the System process, use the
procedure that is described in this section.

NOTE: If you restart the computer during this procedure, the results are not
valid.

1. Start performance monitoring by selecting the Thread object, %Processor Time
   counter, and only the instances of the System process.

2. Note the threads that are using large amounts of processor time.

3. Click the System process in the Process window, and then use the Process
   Viewer tool (Pviewer.exe) to examine the parent process for the thread.

   NOTE: Process Viewer is located in the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit or on the
   Windows 2000 Support Tools CD-ROM.

4. In the Thread window, click the thread number that corresponds to the thread
   that you identified in step two.

5. Note the start address in Process Viewer.

6. At the command prompt, run the Process and Thread Status tool (Pstat.exe) to
   view the running processes and the loaded module list.

   NOTE: Process and Thread Status is located in the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit
   and in the Windows 2000 Resource Kit.

7. Compare the thread start address to the loaded module list.

8. Identify the location of the thread against the module list.

   Usually, this location is a device driver.

9. Contact the vendor of the device driver for additional support.

For more information refer to the "Mapping a System Thread to a Device Driver"
topic (page 79) in Inside Windows 2000, Third Edition.
