SUMMARY

This article lists the names and hex values of the 16 common colors used in HTML
documents.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without warranty
either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied
warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose. This
article assumes that you are familiar with the programming language being
demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug procedures. Microsoft
support professionals can help explain the functionality of a particular
procedure, but they will not modify these examples to provide added
functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific needs. If you have
limited programming experience, you may want to contact a Microsoft Certified
Partner or the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more

NOTE: You may receive an error message if you copy and paste the examples
directly from this article to FrontPage. The angle brackets ("<" and ">")
may appear as escaped HTML code ("&lt;" and "&gt;"). To work around this
behavior, paste the script in a blank Notepad document, and then copy it from
Notepad before you paste it into FrontPage.

Several HTML tags allow you to specify colors in HTML documents. For example, to
set the background color and the default text color, use the BGCOLOR and TEXT
attributes of the BODY tag:

   <body bgcolor="#hex value" text="#hex value>

To specify the color of specific text, use the COLOR attribute of the FONT tag:

   <font color="#hex value">

The hex values are a combination of six hexadecimal digits that are read left to
right in pairs, representing the color levels for Red, Green, and Blue (RGB)
respectively. These values allow for 24-bit color resolution, or a total of
16,777,216 possible colors. However, not every computer is capable of displaying
all of these colors.

The following table lists the names and hex values for the 16 common colors that
all computers should be able to display.

   Name        Hex Value 
   ---------------------
   black       #000000 
   silver      #C0C0C0 
   gray        #808080 
   white       #FFFFFF 
   maroon      #800000 
   red         #FF0000 
   purple      #800080 
   fuchsia     #FF00FF 
   green       #008000 
   lime        #00FF00 
   olive       #808000 
   yellow      #FFFF00 
   navy        #000080 
   blue        #0000FF 
   teal        #008080 
   aqua        #00FFFF 

To use a specific color, simply specify the color value or name. For example,
using the hexadecimal color values the following HTML sample sets the background
color to blue, the default text color to white, and the text color for a
specific range to black:

   <body bgcolor="#0000FF" text="#FFFFFF">
   <p>White text on Blue background.</p>
   <p><font color="#000000">Black text on Blue background.</font></p>
   </body>

Because many browsers support the colors listed in the aforementioned table, you
can use the name of the color rather than the hexadecimal color value. The
following HTML sample shows how to write this code:

   <body bgcolor="blue" text="white">
   <p>White text on Blue background.</p>
   <p><font color="black">Black text on Blue background.</font></p>
   </body>
