SYMPTOMS
========

After the weekend of April 1, 2001 (when we changed to daylight savings time),
if you run the netsend command from the SMS status filter rules, warning
messages may be displayed on the Systems Management Server (SMS) Administrator
console. These messages state that a problem is reported from the Status Manager
component.

When you check the Status Manager component status messages, you see that
multiple entries are generated that are similar to the following message:

   1215 SMS Status Manager received a status message reported by component
   "Hardware Inventory Agent" running on computer "COMPUTER1", and the time
   stamp on the message is more recent than the current system time on the site
   server.

   Possible cause: The system clock on computer "COMPUTER1" is 3575 or more
   seconds ahead of the site server's system clock. Solution: Synchronize the
   system clock of computer "COMPUTER1" with the site server's system clock.
   Please refer to your Windows NT Server documentation or the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base for further information.

   SMS Status Manager will process status messages with improper time stamps when
   the site server's system clock surpasses the improper time stamps. For
   example, this status message will not be processed for 3575 seconds. SMS
   Status Manager will continue to report this problem every 24 hours until you
   fix it.

   SMS Status Manager will not report this problem if the system clock of
   computer "COMPUTER1" is less than 300 seconds ahead of the site server's
   system clock. This interval is configurable in the SMS site control file.
   Please refer to the Microsoft Knowledge Base for further information.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because in SMS Service Pack 2 (SP2), the hardware inventory
component is moved to its own process (its own service). The new service-based
implementation of the SMS Hardware Inventory Agent uses a statically linked
version of the C runtime library that incorrectly calculates time for the first
week of daylight savings time.

view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q214661 FIX: Daylight Savings Time Bug in C Run-Time Library

When the Hardware Inventory Agent completes an inventory cycle, it creates a
status message that contains the incorrect time, and then forwards it to the SMS
site server. Status Manager on the SMS site server evaluates the timestamp on
the status message file (.svf), and notices that the time is more recent than
the current server time. Status Manager moves this file to
Sms\Inboxes\Statmgr.box\Futureq so that it can process it at a later time, and
then generates the warning message described in the preceding section.

NOTE: This behavior only occurs when the computer is using this particular
runtime library when the transition date (the day we change to Daylight Savings
Time) falls on the first day of the month.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, create a new status filter rule to prevent "1215"
status messages from being forwarded to the Status Summarizers.

To create a new status filter rule:

1. In the SMS Administrator console, locate and click the following node:

   

   Site Database
	|
	-<site code - site name>
		|
		- Site Settings
			|
			- Status Filter Rules

2. On the Action menu, click New, and then click Status Filter Rule.

3. Click the General tab, and then type a status filter rule name in the Name
   box, for example "NO1215" (without the quotation marks).

4. Click Component, and then type "SMS_Status_Manager" (without the quotation
   marks).

5. Click MessageID, and then type "1215" (without the quotation marks).

6. Click the Actions tab, and then click to select the "Do Not Forward to Status
   Summarizers" check box.

7. Increase the priority of the new filter:

   a. Expand the Status Filter Rules node.

   b. Right-click the new NO1215 rule, and then click Increment Priority.

   c. Repeat these steps until this status filter rule is displayed at the top
      of the list.

When you complete this procedure to increase the priority of the filter, the
components are prevented from going into a warning or critical state. However,
this procedure does not stop the messages from being loaded into the SMS site
database or being viewed by Status Message Viewer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem stops occurring one week after the transition to daylight savings
time.
