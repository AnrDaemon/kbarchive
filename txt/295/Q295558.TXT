KEYWORDS:kbMsg kbGrpDSMsg kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server 
 - Collaboration Data Objects (CDO), version 1.21 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can use the Access Control List (ACL) component that ships with the Exchange
Developer's Kit and CDO 1.21 to give a user delegate-like access to an Exchange
folder. This is similar to using the Microsoft Outlook user interface to add a
delegate.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To add users as delegates on an Exchange folder, you just need to grant them the
proper permissions.

Note that using the Outlook user interface produces the following results, but
that this method does not:

 - The delegate is listed in the Outlook user interface. To verify this, on the
   Tools menu, click Options, and then click the Delegates tab.

 - You can automatically send a message to new delegates, informing them of
   their permissions.

 - You can indicate that this delegate can view your private items.

Sample Code:

NOTE: For information on the ACL component and how to acquire it, see the
following Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Web site:

   ACL Component
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?URL=/library/psdk/exchserv/comcpnts_8f04.htm

This sample gives UserA delegate-like access to UserB's Calendar folder. In this
instance, UserA is given the role of Reviewer by using the ROLE_REVIEWER
enumeration value. The other delegate roles are Author (ROLE_AUTHOR) and Editor
(ROLE_EDITOR).

To add a delegate to an Exchange folder, follow these steps:

1. In Microsoft Visual Basic version 6.0, create a Standard EXE project.

2. Add a reference to the Microsoft Exchange 5.5 ACL Type Library version 1.0.

3. Add a button to the default form. In the button's Click event, paste the
   following code:

   NOTE: Make sure that you modify the items that are marked "To do."

   ' To do: Change this to the user you want to give delegate access.
   Const UserA = "John Smith"
   ' To do: Change this to the user whose calendar you want to give UserA delegate access to.
   Const UserB = "Jane Smith"

   Dim oSession As MAPI.Session                    ' Session object
   Dim oCalendar As MAPI.Folder                    ' Folder object
   Dim oAddrBook As MAPI.AddressList               ' Address list
   Dim oDelegate As MAPI.AddressEntry              ' Address entry for UserA
   Dim oACLObject As MSExchangeACLLib.ACLObject    ' ACL object
   Dim oACEs As MSExchangeACLLib.IACEs             ' ACEs collection
   Dim oNewACE As MSExchangeACLLib.ACE             ' ACE object
   Dim strProfile As String                        ' String to hold profile information
       
   ' Create a new session and log on.
   Set oSession = CreateObject("MAPI.Session")
       
   ' To do: Change ServerName to the name of your Exchange server.
   strProfile = "ServerName" & vbLf & UserB
   oSession.Logon , , False, True, , True, strProfile
       
   ' Get the GAL so we can get the address entry for UserA.
   Set oAddrBook = oSession.AddressLists("Global Address List")
       
   ' Get the address entry for UserA.
   Set oDelegate = oAddrBook.AddressEntries.Item(UserA)
       
   ' Get the Calendar folder.
   Set oCalendar = oSession.GetDefaultFolder(CdoDefaultFolderCalendar)
       
   ' Create a new ACL Object.
   Set oACLObject = CreateObject("MSExchange.ACLObject")

   ' Link the ACL Object to the Calendar folder.
   oACLObject.CDOItem = oCalendar
       
   ' Get the ACEs collection for the Calendar.
   Set oACEs = oACLObject.ACEs
       
   ' Create a new ACE.
   Set oNewACE = CreateObject("MSExchange.ACE")
       
   ' Set the user for this ACE to UserA.
   oNewACE.ID = oDelegate.ID
       
   ' Set the rights to the "Reviewer" rights.
   oNewACE.Rights = ROLE_REVIEWER
       
   ' Add this ACE to the ACEs collection.
   oACEs.Add oNewACE
       
   ' Update the ACL Object.
   oACLObject.Update

   ' Log off
   oSession.Logoff
       
   ' Indicate the process is finished.
   MsgBox "Done!"
       
   ' Clean up memory.
   Set oNewACE = Nothing
   Set oACEs = Nothing
   Set oACLObject = Nothing
   Set oDelegate = Nothing
   Set oAddrBook = Nothing
   Set oCalendar = Nothing
   Set oSession = Nothing

4. Run the project. Click the button to execute the code.
