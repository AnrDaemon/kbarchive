TITLE   :SMS: Remote Provider Account Not Removed When Site Uninstalled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbsetup kbtool kbDatabase kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an SMS site is uninstalled where the SMS Provider was installed on a remote
SQL server, the SMSProvider_Sitecode account (the SMS Remote Provider connection
account) may remain, and may not be deleted.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, manually remove the SMSProvider_Sitecode account from
the remote SQL server after the SMS site server is uninstalled.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SMSProvider_<sitecode> code account is the SMS Provider Impersonation
account. This account is created automatically when SQL is not installed on the
site server and the SMS Provider resides on the SQL server. This account and its
password are automatically generated during Setup and they are also reset during
a site reset. This account is used by the SMS provider to gain network access to
site server resources.

STATUS
------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server version
2.0.
