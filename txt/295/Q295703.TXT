TITLE   :Cannot View Tour After Installing MSN Explorer
PRODUCT :The Microsoft Network

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In rare instances, after you install and sign-up for MSN Explorer, you may be
unable to view the "MSN Explorer tour".

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you do not have Macromedia Flash installed on your
computer. And you may not have Flash for several reasons:

 - You downloaded MSN Explorer from a Web link that pointed to an installation
   package that did not contain all necessary installation components.

 - You may have installed MSN Explorer from a CD that did not contain all of the
   necessary components.

 - You may have had Flash on your computer, and then deleted Flash. However, the
   registry entries for Flash are still present on your computer. The MSN
   Explorer setup program detected Flash in your registry, and as a result MSN
   Explorer does not include Flash in the installation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Download MSN Explorer again from this Web site:

http://explorer.msn.com

This Web site detects the components that are currently present on your computer
and downloads any missing components.
