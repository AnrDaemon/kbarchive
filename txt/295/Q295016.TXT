======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the MIF Entry tool (MifWin.exe) that is included in the Back Office
4.5 Resource Kit to extend a Systems Management Server (SMS) client computer
inventory, a Windows 2000 user may be unable to save the .mif file that is
created by Mifwin.exe.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the Windows 2000 user does not have the appropriate
permissions to save the file. The Mifwin.exe tool saves the .mif file to the
<Windows_folder>\Ms\Sms\Noidmifs folder on the client by default. The
Windows 2000 default permissions on this folder prevent a user who has low-level
permissions from writing files to this folder.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, use either of the following methods:

 - Modify permissions on the <Windows_folder>\Ms\Sms\Noidmifs folder so
   that users who have low-level permissions can write files to this folder.

   -or-

 - Use SMS software distribution to configure the program to run with
   Administrative rights. To do so, open Program properties, and then click "Run
   with Administrative Rights".

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information, refer to the "Discovery and Inventory Tools" topic in the
Back Office 4.5 Resource Kit.
