TITLE   :XFOR: Messages from Exchange to CC:Mail Remain Queued
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbExchange550

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to send messages from Exchange Server to Lotus cc:Mail by using the
Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail, the Connector for cc:Mail
Service starts but the messages may remain queued in the
\Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Submit folder instead of going to the Lotus cc:Mail users. No
error message appears in the Application Event log.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the \Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Import folder is damaged.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, recreate the subfolders and .ini files that are in
the \Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata folder:

1. Under Services in Control Panel, stop the Connector for cc:Mail Service, and
   then move all of the subfolders and files from the \Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata folder
   to a temporary folder.

2. Under Services in Control Panel, restart the Connector for cc:Mail Service to
   recreate all of the subfolders and .ini files that are in the
   \Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata folder.

3. Stop the Connector for cc:Mail Service again, and then move all of the files
   from the temporary folder back to the \Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Submit folder.

4. Restart the Connector for cc:Mail Service to send the files that are in the
   Submit folder to the cc:Mail post office.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the Connector for cc:Mail finishes the conversion process, the messages are
written to the \Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Submit folder. The cc:Mail Import program then
writes the files to the \Exchsrvr\Import folder. However, if the
\Exchsrvr\Import folder is damaged, the messages remain queued in the
\Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Submit folder.
