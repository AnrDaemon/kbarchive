TITLE   :BUG: PDW Limits 'Add Files' String to 256 Characters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbwizard kbAppSetup kbVBp kbVBp600bug kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to add multiple files to a package that you create with the
Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW), and the list of files creates a string that
is greater than 256 characters in length, you see that the files are not listed
when you scroll through the file list. If you continue to build the package,
these files are not included and the wizard gives no indication of the failure.

CAUSE
=====

The Add File dialog box returns the selected file(s) as a single string that is
limited to 256 characters.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add the files individually or add them a few at a time.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In Visual Basic version 6.0, create a new Standard EXE project.

2. On the File menu, click Save to save the project, and then click Make
   Project1.exe.

3. Start the PDW and select the project that you just created.

4. Click Package and step through the screens, accepting the defaults, until you
   reach the Included Files screen.

5. Click Add, change Files of type to All Files, and browse to a folder that
   contains several files, such as C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual
   Studio\Common\Graphics\Bitmaps\Assorted\. (Note that this particular folder
   is only present if graphics were installed with Visual Basic.)

6. Select all of the files and click Open. This dismisses the dialog box and
   should add these files to the list.

7. Scroll through the list of included files and note that none of the added
   files are listed. Also note that no error message of any kind is raised to
   indicate the failure.

8. Click Add again, browse to the same folder, and add 2-3 files. Note that
   these files do appear in the list.
