-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Occasionally, the installation, configuration, or successful execution of a
custom application written with Visual FoxPro (VFP) is dependent on the
existence of a particular service. Given a valid computer and service name, the
code in this article will let you determine if a particular service exists.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Services are a component of the Microsoft Windows NT and Microsoft Windows 2000
operating systems. A service is defined as:

   "A program, routine, or process that performs a specific system function to
   support other programs, particularly at a low (close to the hardware) level."

When executed on a computer running Microsoft Windows NT or Microsoft Windows
2000, the following VFP code determines if the "IISADMIN" service is present on
the local computer (regardless of whether it is running or not).

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Start Visual FoxPro and create a new program.

2. Paste the following code in the program window:

   #DEFINE ThisMachine	SUBSTR(SYS(0),1,ATC(" ",SYS(0))-1)

   ? ServiceExist("IISADMIN",ThisMachine)

   PROCEDURE ServiceExist(lcServiceName, lcMachineName)
   *~	Prevent this procedure from running
   *~ 	if we're not on NT/2000.
   	IF !INLIST(UPPER(OS()),"WINDOWS 5.00","WINDOWS NT 4.00")
   		RETURN .F.
   	ENDIF

   	#DEFINE GENERIC_READ	0x80000000
   	DECLARE INTEGER OpenSCManager IN advapi32.DLL ;
   		STRING, STRING, INTEGER
   	DECLARE INTEGER OpenService IN advapi32.DLL ;
   		INTEGER, STRING, INTEGER

   	LOCAL liSCM, liService
   	liSCM = OpenSCManager(lcMachineName, NULL, GENERIC_READ)
   	IF !(liSCM > 0)
   		RETURN .F.
   	ENDIF
   	liService = OpenService(liSCM, lcServiceName, GENERIC_READ)

   	RETURN IIF(liService > 0, .T.,.F.)
   ENDPROC

3. Save and then run the program.

4. If the IISADMIN service is present on the local computer, a .T. is printed to
   _SCREEN; if not, a .F. is printed.
