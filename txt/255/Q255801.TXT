The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In order for a file to be transmitted using HTTP compression, the following two
conditions must be true:

 - The client must support a compression scheme used by IIS.
 - IIS must have already compressed the file, which will be stored in a
   temporary folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

How to Determine if the Client Supports Compression:

View the client's HTTP GET Request to see if it specifies a compression value in
the Accept-Encoding header that IIS supports. For example, Internet Explorer 5.0
sends the following header:

   Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

Note: Both the Gzip and Deflate compression schemes are supported by IIS.

How to Determine if the File Is Compressed:

Open the temporary folder that stores the compressed version of files
(C:\WINNT\IIS Temporary Compressed Files by default). In order to avoid
duplicate file names, each file that is compressed, is renamed by appending
characters to the beginning of the file name.

If a compressed, renamed version of the file in question exists, then it is sent
to clients that support the compression scheme.

Note: The temporary folder is specified on the Service tab in the "WWW Service
Master Properties for <ComputerName>" dialog box in the IIS snap-in.
