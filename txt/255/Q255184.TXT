SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack on a Microsoft Cluster
Server-based computer running Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator
(MSDTC), MSDTC may cause errors during installation or may not start after the
option pack installation.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this behavior, follow these steps:

1. Remove the MSDTC resource group from the cluster.

2. On the computer that is running MSDTC, delete the following registry keys:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\MSDTC

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSDTC

3. Remove the shared MSDTCLog folder on the shared drive.

4. Perform a stand-alone installation of MSDTC.

   NOTE: If Windows NT Service Pack 5 is installed on the Cluster Server-based
   computer, contact Microsoft Technical Support to obtain the Dtcsetup.exe
   setup program and to request the hotfix appropriate for your environment. The
   hotfix creates an MSDTCLog folder on the shared drive and adds the MSDTC
   resource group in Cluster Administrator.

5. Stop and restart the cluster services on both nodes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install multiple Microsoft server applications in a cluster
environment, you must install them in a prescribed order. Failure to follow the
prescribed order may cause the applications not to be installed correctly.
