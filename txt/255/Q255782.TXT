SUMMARY
=======

This article demonstrates how to use ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) and ADO
Extensions for DDL and Security (ADOX) to modify the underlying SQL query of an
Access 97 or Access 2000 QueryDef object from a Visual Basic application at run
time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following example uses the Northwind Access database that ships with Visual
Basic. For illustration purposes, a new Query object named "All Customers" is
created in this database at design time using Access. The underlying query for
the QueryDef object is a simple SQL SELECT statement that retrieves all the
records in the Customers table. Using ADO and ADOX, the Visual Basic code
modifies the SQL query of the "All Customers" QueryDef object.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Use Microsoft Access to open the Northwind.mdb database, which is located in
   the Visual Basic installation directory.

2. Create a new Query object in the database that retrieves all the records in
   the Customers table. Specify the SQL query for the new Query object as
   "Select * from Customers". Save the query object as "All Customers". Save
   your changes to the database, and exit Access.

3. Create a new Standard EXE Project in Visual Basic.

4. On the Project menu, click References, and select the Microsoft ActiveX Data
   Objects 2.1 library and Microsoft ADO Ext. 2.1 for DDL and Security check
   boxes.

5. Add a command button to Form1.

6. Add the following code to the form's General Declarations section:

      Dim cn As Connection
      Dim mcat As ADOX.Catalog
      Dim mview As ADOX.View

7. Add the following code to the command button's Click() event procedure:

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
       Dim cmd As ADODB.Command

       Set cn = New ADODB.Connection
       cn.Open "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;DataSource=nwind.mdb"
       Set mcat = New ADOX.Catalog
       Set mcat.ActiveConnection = cn

       Set mview = mcat.Views("All Customers")
       Set cmd = mview.Command
       cmd.CommandText = "Select * from customers Order by CompanyName"
       Set mview.Command = cmd

       MsgBox "Querydef [All Customers] has been modified !"
       
       Set mview = Nothing
       Set cmd = Nothing
       Set mcat = Nothing
       cn.Close
   End Sub

   The Query objects that are defined in an Access database are listed in the
   Views collection of the ADOX Catalog object. Each ADOX.View object has a
   Command property that contains a reference to an ADODB.Command object, which
   defines the underlying query of the QueryDef object. The preceding code
   modifies the CommandText property of this Command object to modify the query
   definition of the Access Query object.

8. Press the F5 key to run the project.

9. Click the command button that appears on the form. The code in the Click
   event runs and modifies the query definition of the "All Customers" QueryDef
   object.
