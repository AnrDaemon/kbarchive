TITLE   :BUG: CE: CommandBar Settings May Keep Key Events from Firing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::1.0,2.11,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbToolkit kbVBp600bug kbOSWinCEsearch kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Windows CE versions 2.11, 3.0 for the Handheld PC 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the position of a CommandBar control is set to a non-zero value at design
time through either the Left or Top property and then is subsequently changed at
run time through either the Move method or the setting of the Top or Left
property, the Key events (KeyPress, KeyDown, KeyUp) of the form upon which the
CommandBar control is sited do not fire.

NOTE: This only occurs on the remote device and not in emulation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Ensure that the Top and Left properties of the CommandBar control are both set
to zero at design time and then set the position of the control at run time.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Windows CE project in either Visual Basic or eMbedded Visual
   Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. From the Project menu, select Components, and then select the Microsoft CE
   CommandBar Control.

3. Add a CommandBar Control to Form1. Ensure that either the Top or Left
   property is set to a non-zero value.

4. Paste the following code into Form1:

   Private Sub Form_KeyDown(KeyCode As Integer, Shift As Integer)
       MsgBox "KeyCode= " & KeyCode
   End Sub

   Private Sub Form_KeyPress(KeyAscii As Integer)
       MsgBox "KeyAscii= " & KeyAscii
   End Sub

   'Private Sub Form_Load()
   '    CommandBar1.Move 0, 0
   'End Sub

5. Run the application, targeting the remote device.

6. Ensure that Form1 is active, and then press a key on the keyboard. Note that
   two message boxes appear.

7. Uncomment the Form_Load event, and run the project again.

8. Ensure that Form1 is active, and then press a key on the virtual keyboard.
   Note that the message boxes no longer appear.
