======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the access rights to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft registry key
are reduced so that the logged-on user no longer has the access rights to create
subkeys in the registry, Drwtsn32 does not work correctly and does not update
the Drwtsn32.log file or generate a User.dmp file.

CAUSE
=====

When Drwtsn32.exe runs, it requests KEY_CREATE_SUB_KEY privileges when it opens
its registry key to determine what configuration to use. If the logged-on user
does not have these privileges, Drwtsn32 does not run correctly and no log file
or user dump file is generated.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows 2000
------------
