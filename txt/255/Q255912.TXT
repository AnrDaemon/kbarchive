SUMMARY
=======

For a COM+ application, you can set the server process that is associated with
the COM+ application to shut down automatically after a certain period of
inactivity through the Component Services.

If the COM+ application is used by Internet Information Services (IIS), the
type-library caching feature in IIS must be disabled to let this timeout take
effect. The "More Information" section of this article describes how to disable
the type-library caching.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The AspEnabletypelibCache value in the metabase controls the type library
caching feature. Set it to False (it is set to True by default) to disable the
type library caching. There are three application-protection levels in IIS:

   Low (IIS Process)
   Medium (Pooled)
   High (Isolated)

The AspEnabletypelibCache setting at the /W3SVC level of the metabase affects all
applications with Low (IIS Process) and Medium (Pooled) protection levels. If
the application protection is set to High (Isolated), the AspEnabletypelibCache
setting should be set at that application level of the metabase, so that it only
applies to that application.
