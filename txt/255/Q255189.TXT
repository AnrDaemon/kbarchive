TITLE   :Windows NT Explorer Displays Only Font Files on CD-ROM Copy
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a CD-ROM containing the uncompressed setup files for Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0 (or for a service pack) in the I386 folder, and you view that
folder from Microsoft Windows NT Explorer, you may see only the font files. The
other files in the folder may not appear.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the Desktop.ini file is not compressed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, compress the Desktop.ini file and rename it to
Desktop.in_ before you create the CD-ROM.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Desktop.ini file that is in the I386 folder contains a link to a registry
key that designates it as a Fonts folder. The file contains the following
string:

   [.ShellClassInfo]
   UICLSID={BD84B380-8CA2-1069-AB1D-08000948F534}

If the folder has the read-only or system attribute, Windows NT Explorer reads
the Desktop.ini file and links the Uiclsid back to the registry key. The
registry identifies the folder as the Fonts folder, and Windows NT Explorer
therefore displays only the fonts contained in it, and not the rest of the
files.

This issue does not occur with the installation media because, on the CD-ROM for
Windows NT 4.0 or for a service pack, the Desktop.ini file is compressed and has
an 'underscore' extension (Desktop.in_).
