TITLE   :Err Msg: 19033-ERROR: $multi_valued() Subscript Goes Beyond...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbtool

======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

The management agent (MA) log may incorrectly report the following error
message:

   19033-ERROR: $multi_valued() subscript goes beyond range 12121 in template []
   in the statement starting at line XX

Both the range (512) value and the line number are reported incorrectly. The line
number is reported incorrectly if the $multi_valued function follows comments in
the template.

CAUSE
=====

The error message occurs with the $multi_valued function. If the first parameter
contains all numbers, it is assumed to be a subscript number rather than a
string value to search for. If the first parameter contains letters, it is
considered a string and you do not receive the error message.

RESOLUTION
==========

A partial resolution is to remove the double comments before the function to
have the correct line reported. The range value continues to be incorrectly
reported.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
