TITLE   :XADM: Exchange Server Setup Stops on Microsoft Terminal Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Microsoft Exchange Server Setup program on Microsoft Windows NT
Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition after logging on from a local account, you
may receive the following error message:

   This computer must belong to a Windows NT domain before Microsoft Exchange
   can be installed.

The computer is already a member of the domain, and it is properly configured to
communicate on your local area network.

You may also receive this error message when you use a local account to install
Exchange Server on a computer running Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when you log on to the computer from a local account
instead of a Windows NT domain account.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, log off the computer, and then log on again from a
Windows NT domain account that has the appropriate permissions to perform
installations.
