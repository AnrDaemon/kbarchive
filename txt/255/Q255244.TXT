SUMMARY
=======

If you use Outlook with the Journaling feature enabled, many entries may
accumulate in the Journal folder. If you disable the Journaling feature, these
items are still listed in the Journal folder.

To clear these entries from the Journal folder you need to manually delete them.
The Journal folder is displayed as a timeline by default. This can make it
difficult to select multiple items or to delete all of the Journal entries at
one time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To delete multiple entries or all of the entries in the Journal folder:

1. Click Journal.

2. On the View menu, click Current View, and then click Entry List. In this view
   the Journal items are displayed in a table view, which allows you to select
   multiple items.

3. Perform one of the following steps, as applicable:

    - To delete multiple entries, click to select the items that you want to
      remove, and then click Delete.

    - To delete all of the entries, click Select All on the Edit menu, and then
      click Delete.
