TITLE   :Permissions on Temp Folder Are Set Incorrectly with FlatTemp
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4,4.0 SP5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you run the "flattemp /enable" command on a Terminal Server with either
Service Pack 4 or Service Pack 5 installed, the Temp folder permissions are
changed when a user logs on to the Terminal Server console. The existing
permissions are replaced with:

   <Username> [FC]
   Administrators [FC]
   System [FC]

The correct permissions for the Temp folder should be:

   Creator Owner [FC]
   Everyone [Change]
   Administrators [FC]
   System [FC]

Attempting to access the Temp folder in a Terminal Server session results in an
"Access denied" error message.

CAUSE
=====

The local console logon process ignores the FlatTemp registry setting and sets
the permissions on the Temporary folder to allow access only to the logged-on
user.
