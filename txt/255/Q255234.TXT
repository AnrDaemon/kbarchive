PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the Internet Mail Service on a Microsoft Exchange Server that
is running on a Windows 2000 Server-based computer, Setup may stop with the
following error when authenticating the service account password:

   Logon failure: Unknown user name or bad password. ID no. 0xc002052e

CAUSE
=====

The service account user name for the System Attendant is in the format of
<user>@<domain>.com. The Internet Mail Service Setup wizard
references the System Attendant's service account and only understands the
format of <domain>\<user>.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. In the Microsoft Management Console, edit the properties of the Exchange
   System Attendant service.

2. On the Log On tab, type the service account name in the format of
   <domain>\<user>

3. Restart the System Attendant service and rerun the Internet Mail Service
   Setup wizard.
