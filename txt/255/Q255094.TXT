Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

These forms demonstrate how to use the SliderBar ActiveX control. The code
examples provided in the SliderBar Help file are written in Visual Basic. These
forms translate the Visual Basic code into Visual FoxPro code. The essential
functionality of the original examples has not changed, but some additional code
was added to more clearly demonstrate certain functionality.

To see the example, do the following:

1. Download and unzip the Slidebar.exe

2. Run the Slidebar1.scx form.

3. Click on the form to change the orientation of the sliderbar. This calls the
   Orientation method of the SliderBar object.

4. Click on the slider bar and slide the pointer to the end of the control and
   notice the text box resizes when you release. Slide it back and the text box
   shrinks when you release. The text box does not shrink to less than one-third
   the size of the SliderBar control.

5. Click the Do Sliderbar2 form command button.

6. Hold down the Shift key while clicking on the pointer of the SliderBar
   control. Slide the pointer to the middle of the control and release. Notice
   the text boxes populate with the appropriate values.

7. Hold down the Shift key while clicking on the pointer of the SliderBar
   control. Move the pointer out to the end of the control. Again, notice the
   text boxes populate with the appropriate values.

8. Click the Do Sliderbar3 form button.

9. Choose items from the combo box to change the TickStyle property.

10. Hold down the Shift key while moving the SliderBar control to see the
   SelectRange demonstration.

11. Move the SliderBar to see the GetNumTicks property demonstration.

12. Press the Exit button to close the form.
