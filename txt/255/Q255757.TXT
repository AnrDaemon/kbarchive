======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A circular dependency compilation error can occur when a User Defined Type (UDT)
is defined in a class module that implements another base class interface, and
the base class module has references to the UDT.

RESOLUTION
==========

Move the UDT definition to the base class module.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Visual Basic ActiveX DLL project. Class1 is created by default.

2. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Class1:

   Public Function myFunct() As myUDT
   End Function

3. On the Project menu, select Add Class Module, and then add Class2 to the
   project.

4. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Class2:

   Public Type myUDT
       iNum As Integer
   End Type

   Implements Class1

   Private Function Class1_myFunct() As myUDT
   End Function

5. Run the project. The following error is raised:

   Compile Error:
   Circular dependencies between modules.

6. To correct the problem, move the definition of myUDT from Class2 to Class1
   and run the project again. No error occurs.
