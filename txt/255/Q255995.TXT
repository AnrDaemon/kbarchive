======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Deploying Microsoft Windows 2000 by using Systems Management Server (SMS)
requires the use of an Unattend.txt file. This file must supply Windows 2000
Setup with a CD Key number during installation. In addition, the Unattend.txt
answer file should also contain the domain name and account information to
create a computer account during the upgrade process. You can use the
Unattend.txt file to configure additional settings during the installation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the Unattend.txt answer file does not contain the domain name and account
information to create a computer account, the client may not be able to join the
domain after the upgrade and may become orphaned from the SMS site.
