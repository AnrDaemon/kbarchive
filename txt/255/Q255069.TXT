TITLE   :XADM: Error Message Opening Address Book When Running Pfinfo.exe
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run the Exchange Server Public Folder Information utility (Pfinfo.exe),
the following message may be displayed in the summary window:

   Process completed. Errors encountered.

The following error message is logged in the Pfinfo log file that is specified in
the utility:

   Error opening Address Book: Error MAPI_W_ERRORS_RETURNED - One or more
   address book providers could not be loaded Process completed. Errors
   encountered. 0 folders processed. 1 errors encountered

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, make sure that the Messaging Application Programming
Interface (MAPI) profile that exports the public folder information contains
only the Exchange Server service.

To do this, in Control Panel, click Mail, click the profile, and then click
Properties. Click the Services tab, and then make sure that only the Exchange
Server service is configured.

If any other services are configured, create a new profile that contains only the
Exchange Server Service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Pfinfo.exe utility extracts information about the public folders in an
Exchange Server site. The Pfinfo.exe utility can also generate a file that
contains information about public folder permissions and replicas, which you can
use in conjunction with the Pfadmin.exe utility that is included in the
Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit.
