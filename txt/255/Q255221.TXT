TITLE   :Client Can't Connect to Secure Web Site Requiring Reverse Lookup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Network clients may be unable to connect to secure Web sites that verify that
the client Internet Protocol (IP) address belongs to a domain name registered in
North America. If you attempt to download 128-bit encryption, you may receive a
message stating that your IP address cannot be resolved to a domain name
registered in North America.

Clients experience no other problems browsing the Internet. Your Domain Naming
System (DNS) server has a reverse lookup zone that is correctly configured.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when your DNS server is not registered with Internic to
provide reverse lookup resolution for the network address of a segment of your
network. When the DNS server has not registered a segment's network address with
Internic, reverse lookup will not succeed for clients that have an IP address
belonging to that network segment; the IP address cannot be resolved to a domain
name.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, use reverse lookup resolution for the network segment
by registering the network address of the segment with Internic on your DNS
server.
