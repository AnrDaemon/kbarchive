SUMMARY
=======

If you use the Draw tool to draw a new draw object on top of an existing draw
object, you create a stack of draw objects. You can overlap as many draw objects
as you want to, and then rearrange the stack of layered draw objects by using
the commands on the Draw menu.

To display the Draw menu, click Draw on the Drawing toolbar at the bottom of the
screen in Microsoft MapPoint 2001.

The following commands are available on the Draw menu:

1. Click "Bring to Front" or "Send to Back" to move a draw object to the front
   or send it to the back of a stack of layered draw objects.

2. Click Bring Forward or Send Backward to move a draw object forward or
   backward by one level within a stack of layered draw objects.

3. Click "Bring in Front of Roads" or Send Behind Roads to move a draw object in
   front of or behind the roads that are displayed on the map.
