TITLE   :TAMA Additions Appear as Modifcations in Export File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Together Administration Management Agent (TAMA) tool, new
records are added to the Export.ta file as modifications rather than as new
records. This creates a problem with connected directories such as Microsoft
Exchange, because a new user is not created if the record is submitted as a
modification.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when the import process uses the Modification Parsing
template instead of the Add template. If you view the Export.ta file in the
working directory of the Management Agent (MA), new records are preceded with an
M rather than an A. This behavior occurs when TAMA runs, and creates new users
below the MA.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, in the MA working directory, open the Export.ta file in
a text editor and change the M at the beginning of each record to an A.

The Export.ta file appears as:

   M cn=Jane Doe
   Telephone: 222-2222
   e-mail: someone@microsoft.com

The Export.ta file after modification:

   A cn=Jane Doe
   Telephone: 222-2222
   e-mail: someone@microsoft.com

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
