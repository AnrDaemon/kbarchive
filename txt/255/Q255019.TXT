======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If a message is received from SMTP by means of an Exchange Server computer that
is configured to perform MIME Internet X.400 Enhanced Relay (MIXER) address
mapping, the address may be encapsulated in the X.400 address of the MIXER
server, even if the recipient's SMTP address appears in the global address list.
The recipient's address is displayed as an SMTP address instead of as the
display name that is listed in the global address list entry (mailbox or custom
recipient). If you double-click this name, the Address Type is displayed as
X.400 and the full Address is the X.400 address of the MIXER server, with a
Request for Comments (RFC) 822 domain-defined attribute (DDA) that contains the
value of the SMTP Address. If there is more than one such recipient of this
message, the reply to all option does not work.

For example, if an SMTP message is addressed to exchange.user@microsoft.com, the
message arrives over a MIXER server that has an X.400 address of "C=us; A= ;
P=company; O=SMTP-GW," the recipient is known to MIXER and the global address
list is replicated to this server; the message is not addressed to the SMTP
address of the mailbox. The address is translated to the following:

   C=us; A= ; P=company; O=SMTP-GW; DDA:RFC-822=exchange.user@microsoft.com

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the message transfer agent (MTA) only resolves
incoming addresses to route the message. In this case, the P1 (envelope) address
is created from the global address list entry so the message can be delivered
correctly, but the P2 (content) address, which is shown to users, is not
resolved from the global address list.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, configure the Internet Mail Service to resolve the P2
address. For additional information, click the article number below to view the

   and Cc Lines

STATUS

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 3. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server
5.5 Service Pack 4.
