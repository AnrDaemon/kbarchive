   Your logon information is incorrect.

There is no loss of connectivity from the computer that is running Windows 2000

shared list on the Exchange Server computer, you can log on to the Microsoft
Windows NT Server 4.0 domain, and you can ping by name and by Internet Protocol
(IP).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, remove and re-add Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) in the Local Area Connection properties:

1. Double-click the My Computer icon, double-click Control Panel, and then
   double-click "Network and Dial-Up Connections".

2. Click Local Area Connection, click Properties on the File menu, and then
   click to clear the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) check box.

3. Install another protocol (NWlink or NetBEUI) to maintain a placeholder for
   each connection.

4. Restart your computer, double-click the My Computer icon, double-click
   Control Panel, and then double-click "Network and Dial-Up Connections".

5. Click Local Area Connection, click Properties on the File menu, and then
   click to select the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) check box to add TCP/IP.
