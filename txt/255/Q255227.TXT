TITLE   :Partial Domain Synchronization From Server Manager Does Not Work
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When partial domain synchronization requests are issued through Server Manager,
they may not succeed and Event Viewer may record neither success nor failure
events. However, full synchronization requests that use the net accounts /sync
command from the primary domain controller (PDC) work correctly and Event Viewer
logs the successful synchronization.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when an earlier installation of Novell NetWare Directory
Services (NDS) for Windows NT was not fully removed from the PDC.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, completely remove the Novell NDS program from the
PDC.
