TITLE   :Terminal Server Profile Path and Home Directory Missing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When your network is using Terminal Server, some user accounts may randomly lose
their Terminal Server Profile Path, their Terminal Server Home Directory
location, or both.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when there are Microsoft Windows NT Server 3.51-based
computers on your network and you use the Windows NT 3.51 version of User
Manager for Domains to edit user account information. Using this version to make
changes to a user account overwrites the Terminal Server Profile Path and
Terminal Server Home Directory location for that user.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, do not use the Windows NT 3.51 version of User
Manager for Domains to edit any user account information or to administer
Terminal Server user accounts. Use only the Terminal Server version of User
Manager for Domains.
