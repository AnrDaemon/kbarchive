TITLE   :Roaming Profiles May Not Synchronize Correctly in Windows
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to a domain using a computer running Windows 2000 and your
profile is located on a computer running Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, the local and
server-based profiles may not synchronize and the following event may be logged
in Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 1000
   Event Type: Error
   Event Source: Userenv
   Event Category: None
   Description: Windows cannot unload your registry file. If you have a roaming
   profile, your settings are not replicated. Contact your administrator.

   DETAIL: Access is denied.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the share that contains your user profile is not set to
Full Control.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, put user profiles for clients running Windows 2000 on
servers and domain controllers running Windows 2000 Server or change the
permissions on the share to Full Control.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Change permission in Windows NT 4.0 Server does not allow WRITE_DAC access,
which is required by the user profile code to update ACLs on the server-based
profile. Change permissions in Windows 2000 Server have the appropriate access
rights to allow the server-based profile to be updated.
