TITLE   :SQL Backup to Remote Drive Fails, Error 18204: Access is Denied
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to back up a server running Microsoft SQL Server to a remote
network share, the backup attempt may not succeed and the following error
message may appear:

   18204 Access is denied

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the MSSQLSERVER account does not have the correct
access permissions to the folder where the backup file is to be created.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, make sure that the MSSQLSERVER account has been
granted the "Access this computer from the network user" right on the remote
computer, and that it has Full Control permissions to the folder where the
backup file is to be created. If the backup file already exists on the remote
share, make sure the MSSQLSERVER account has Full Control permissions to the
existing file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can check your MSSQLSERVER account permissions by logging on to the
Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0-based computer where SQL Server resides, using
the MSSQLSERVER account. Map to the remote drive, and then delete, rename, or
create a file in the destination folder where the dump file is to be stored. If
that does not work, then the account does not have the proper permissions.
