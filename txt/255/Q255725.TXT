TITLE   :PRB: Error Message Accessing Objects Added to Visual FoxPro COM
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCOMt kbCtrl kbvfp600 kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbCodeSnippet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an object is added to a Component Object Model (COM) server at run time,
attempts to access that object result in the following error message:

   OLE error code 0x80020006: Unknown name

CAUSE
=====

Visual FoxPro looks in the type library file (.tlb) to locate the object name
reference associated with the COM server. When Visual FoxPro cannot find the
object name reference there, it produces the error.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this situation, do one of the following:

 - Add a procedure or procedures to the COM server that can access the added
   object or objects.

 - Utilize functions or procedures in lieu of adding objects to COM servers at
   run time.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To produce the behavior, perform the following steps:

1. Within Microsoft Visual FoxPro 6.0, create a new project called "mytest"
   (without the quotation marks).

2. Add a new program to the "mytest" (without the quotation marks) project and
   input the following code:

   DEFINE CLASS myole AS CUSTOM OLEPUBLIC
       lcReturnValue = "This is a test."
       FUNCTION givereturn
           RETURN This.lcReturnValue
       ENDFUNC
       PROCEDURE returnmyname
             RETURN This.oMyName.lcMyName
       ENDPROC
   ENDDEFINE

   DEFINE CLASS myclass AS CUSTOM OLEPUBLIC
      lcMyName = "This is my name"
   ENDDEFINE

3. Close and save the program as "test" (without the quotation marks).

4. In the Project Manager, click the Build button, and build a single-threaded
   COM server (DLL) in Visual FoxPro 6.0 with SP3, or build a COM DLL in Visual
   FoxPro 6.0. Upon completion of the build, close the Project Manager.

5. In the Microsoft Visual FoxPro Command window, run the following lines of
   code:

   oMyObj = CREATEOBJECT("mytest.myole") &&Loads the myole class of mytest.dll

   ?oMyObj.GiveReturn() &&This will print "This is a test." to the screen

   oMyObj.ADDOBJECT("oMyName","myclass") &&Add newclass object to myole

   ?oMyObj.oMyName.lcMyName  &&This will produce the error

6. Use the following line of code in the Command window and confirm that the
   oMyNameobject is scoped to the returnmyname procedure:

   ?oMyObj.ReturnMyName()  &&This will print "This is my name" to the screen
