TITLE   :HTTP Compressed Files Not Created in Temporary Folder
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOSWin2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

No compressed files are stored in the temporary folder (also known as the cache
directory), even though a client that supports HTTP compression has requested
them.

CAUSE
=====

Internet Services were not restarted after HTTP compression was enabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

Restart Internet Services. To do this, perform the following steps:

1. Start the Internet Service Manager (ISM), which loads the Internet
   Information Server snap-in.

2. Right-click the computer name, and then click Restart IIS on the Context
   menu.

3. Select "Restart Internet Services on <ComputerName>", and then click
   OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a file is requested, the compressed copy is stored in a temporary folder,
and then sent when further requests are received. Files are not compressed prior
to receiving a request for them.

Note: By default, the temporary folder is C:\WINNT\IIS Temporary Compressed
Files. This is specified on the Service tab in the "WWW Service Master
Properties for <ComputerName>" dialog box in the IIS snap-in.
