-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services, versions 2.1, 2.2, 2.2 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can update a Management Agent's templates from its working folder by running
"Update Management Agent." You may need to update your Management Agent
templates to recover from unsuccessful Management Agent changes or to transfer a
Management Agent between Microsoft Metadirectory Services-based servers.
Management Agent templates are stored as attributes of the Management Agent
object in the metaverse. By default, the Management Agent will be updated with
the included templates in the Zoomserv\Data\Dsgates folder. Any customization
you have performed in the Design MA area will be lost. If you have recorded your
templates to the working folder, this article describes how to refresh the
Management Agent with those templates.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before following these steps, you must either:

 - Have recorded the customized Management Agent templates to the working folder
   and now need to restore the metaverse with your customized templates. For
   information about recording Management Agents templates to the working
   folder, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Services

 - Have custom templates that you want to use in place of the current templates.
   You have copied them into the working folder, overriding the existing
   templates.
