TITLE   :Cannot Log On to PDC After Unsuccessful Installation of NDS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you remove an unsuccessful installation of Novell NetWare Directory
Services on a primary domain controller (PDC) running Microsoft Windows NT
Server 4.0, you may be unable to log on to the PDC and you may receive an error
message citing Error C00000DF.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the files Samlib.dll, Samsrv.dll, and Winlogon.exe
are the incorrect version.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, update the relevant files. Follow these steps:

1. Perform a parallel installation, including the same service pack that is
   installed for the original installation.

2. Start the computer to the parallel installation.

3. Start Windows Explorer, and then view the following files to see whether
   their date/time stamps are correct for the service pack installed for the
   original installation of Windows NT:

   Samlib.dll

   Samsrv.dll

   Winlogon.exe

4. Rename any of these files that do not have the correct date/time stamp, and
   then replace them with copies from the parallel installation.
