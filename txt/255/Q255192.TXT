SYMPTOMS

as an attachment to an e-mail message by right-clicking the file, clicking Send
To, and then clicking Mail Recipient, Outlook may not start and you may receive

works properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, use one of the following procedures:

 - Copy the Frmcache.dat file from the C:\Windows\Forms folder to the user's
   %SystemRoot%\Profiles\%username%\Windows\Forms folder.

   -or-
