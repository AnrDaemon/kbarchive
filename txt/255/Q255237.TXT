SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Exchange MAPI Management Agent, you may receive the following
error message:

   Error was encountered in function : HrDoImport calling DAPIWrite.. Error
   message :
   DAPIWrite for Mailbox /o=TEST/ou=TEST1/cn=Mailing Lists/cn=Test_design failed

This issue can occur if you use illegal characters in the Display-Name-Printable
box in the Foreign Entries Output Add template.

The name in this box populates the Simple Display Name field in Exchange.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, do not use illegal characters when you create the Simple
Display Name for Exchange.
