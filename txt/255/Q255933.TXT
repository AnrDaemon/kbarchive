TITLE   :SMS: User Must Log on for Win 9x to Run Mandatory Assignment
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,2.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When there is no user logged on to a Microsoft Windows 95/98 computer, the
mandatory assignment of a software distribution package will not run on the
computer.

CAUSE
=====

Advertised Program Monitor (SMSMON32) loads when a user logs on to the computer.
SMSMON32 is the program that runs the mandatory assignments.

WORKAROUND
==========

To allow the mandatory assignment to run automatically on a Windows 9x computer,
make sure there is a valid domain user logged on to the computer.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Networking service on a Windows 95/98 computer does not start before the logon
process completes. Because SMSMON32 depends on the networking service, it does
not load before the logon process is completed.
