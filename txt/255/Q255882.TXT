TITLE   :XFOR: Migrating Double-Byte Character Set Messages from cc:Mail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you migrate messages from Lotus cc:Mail, the language of the operating
system that the Migration Wizard runs on determines the CODEPAGE switch of the
Import and Export processes that the Migration Wizard starts.

Therefore, if you migrate messages from cc:Mail that contain double-byte
character set (DBCS) characters, you need to run the Migration Wizard on an
operating system of that particular language.

For example, if you migrate messages that contain Chinese characters, run the
Migration Wizard on the Chinese version of Microsoft Windows NT Server. US-ASCII
characters are migrated correctly because they are a subset of DBCS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the incorrect CODEPAGE switch is used to extract messages from cc:Mail, the
Migration Wizard does not migrate DBCS characters correctly, even when you use
the two-step migration process and modify the CodePage header in the .pkl file.
The DBCS characters in the migration files are already corrupted.
