SYMPTOMS
========

After an administrator removes a user (either as a member or an owner) from a
Team Workspace, the workspace Outlook bar may still be displayed in Microsoft
Outlook for that user. If the user logs off Outlook, the Outlook bar appears
again after the user logs on to Outlook again. If the user attempts to gain
access to the workspace by clicking the Outlook bar, the user is prompted for
logon credentials, and the following error message appears after the credentials
are entered:

   Error: Access is Denied

CAUSE
=====

The change in user rights is not effective until that user logs off and back on
to the workstation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, the user should log off and then back on to the
workstation.
