======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When distributing a Visual Basic application from a Windows 2000 system that
references the COM+ Services Type Library, the Package and Deployment Wizard
(PDW) includes the Comsvcs.dll file in the distribution package.

CAUSE
=====

The Visual Basic 6.0 Package and Deployment Wizard and the Visual Basic 5.0
Application Setup Wizard normally include all files that are referenced by the
project being packaged and do not include any special handling code for the
Comsvcs.dll file.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you are creating the Visual Basic application package for distribution,
deselect the Comsvcs.dll file from the files list when you are stepping into the
Included Files dialog box of the Package portion of the Package and Deployment
Wizard.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Comsvcs.dll file is a non-redistributable system file that already exists on
target Windows 2000 systems.

REFERENCES
==========

For a list of files that can be distributed with your applications, please check
the Redist.txt file shipped with Visual Basic and Microsoft Visual Studio.

Additional query words: COM Comsvcs Redist
