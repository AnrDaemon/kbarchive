======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Dcpromo process runs on a Windows 2000 Server-based computer that is
running Exchange Server 5.5, the Exchange Server services may not start. Also,
Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) and Internet Message Access Protocol
(IMAP) clients may be unable to authenticate when those clients connect to the
Exchange Server computer. The following event may be found in the Application
Event Log on the Exchange Server.

   

   Event ID: 13003
   Source: MSExchangePOP3
   Type: Error
   Category: Authentication
   Description: A required privilege is not held by the client

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because, when the Dcpromo process is running, the
Security Accounts Manager (SAM) database (which contains all of the local
accounts) is removed and the security policy of the Exchange Server service
account is altered.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, start the Services Microsoft Management Console (MMC)
and reassociate the correct user name and password with each of the Exchange
Server services. You must reinstall Exchange Server Service Pack 3 for POP3 and
IMAP clients to work properly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 2000 Server.
