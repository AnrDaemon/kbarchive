SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to verify that Secure Sockets Layer is working on the
Exchange Server Internet Mail Service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To verify that Secure Sockets Layer is working on the Exchange Server Internet
Mail Service, telnet to port 25 of the Internet Mail Service and type the
following:

   EHLO <host>.<domain>.com

The Internet Mail Service should return STARTTLS. If STARTTLS is not returned,
Secure Sockets Layer is not configured.

If the Internet Mail Service is set up to communicate through Secure Sockets
Layer with a particular domain, you must enter the domain name after the first
EHLO. If you omit the domain, the STARTTLS does not reply.
