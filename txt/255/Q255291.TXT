TITLE   :XADM: Event ID 1356 - LDAP Modify Request Fails with Error 16
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5, the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP) modify request fails and logs the following event:

   Event ID: 1356
   Type: Warning
   Category: LDAP Interface
   Description:
   LDAP modify request failed with error: 16

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior can occur when you use an Active Directory Service Interface
(ADSI) or an LDAP-based application to modify a directory object on an Exchange
Server computer. The error 16 (decimal) maps to hex error 0x10. When the LDAP.h
file is referenced, this error maps to LDAP_NO_SUCH_ATTRIBUTE.

To prevent this behavior from occurring, increase the diagnostic logging level on
the LDAP interface for the MSExchangeDS service object. To do so, follow these
steps:

1. Start Exchange Server Administrator.

2. In the Servers container, select the server that you want to modify, point to
   File, and then right-click Properties.

3. Click Diagnostic Logging, and then click MSExchangeDS.

4. In the Category pane, select LDAP Interface.

5. In the Logging Level box, click Maximum.

After you increase the diagnostic logging level, you must modify the ADSI/LDAP
application to produce an event ID 1356. To do so, follow these steps:

   a. Click "Windows NT Event Viewer" to view the application log.

   b. Locate the event ID 1356 and note any previous event ID 1326. The earlier
      event ID 1326 identifies the attribute that is producing the present
      event.

   c. Revise the initial LDAP modify request to search for a valid attribute.
