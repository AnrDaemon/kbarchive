TITLE   :Administrator Console May Not Connect After Changing SQL Account
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you change the SQL password in the Systems Management Server (SMS)
Administrator console and then reboot the computer, the SMS Administrator
console may not connect. All of the SMS services can connect to SQL to perform
their respective functions without a problem. Prior to rebooting, there is no
problem.

CAUSE
=====

When you change the password in the SMS Administrator console, the SQL password
information in the registry is not updated, even after a reboot. The SMS
provider, which is used by the SMS Administrator console to obtain connections
to SQL, obtains encrypted password information from the registry to log on to
SQL.

WORKAROUND
==========

Performing a site reset resolves this issue because the site reset process
causes the registry information to be updated.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION

Administrator console, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
