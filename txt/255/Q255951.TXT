The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

By default, Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 uses the GZip and Deflate
HTTP compression methods. Both compression methods are implemented through an
ISAPI filter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

ISAPI Filter:

HTTP compression is a subservice of IIS, which is handled through an ISAPI
filter. Because this filter is installed at the WWW Service level, compression
must be configured for the entire Web server. It cannot be configured for a
specific Web site. The following two files handle this compression (located in
the %WinDir%\System32\INETSERV folder):

 - CompFilt.dll
 - GZIP.dll

Compression Methods:

 - GZIP file format specification - RFC 1952
 - DEFLATE Compressed Data Format Specification - RFC 1951

Note: To look up an RFC, see http://www.ietf.org

For more information on enabling HTTP compression, review the Internet
Information Services documentation.
