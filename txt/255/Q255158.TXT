TITLE   :Cannot Start WordPad Maximized by Double-Clicking .wri/.doc File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start WordPad (or any other MFC-dependent program) in Windows NT 4.0 by
double-clicking an associated file type (such as a .doc or .wri file), WordPad
does not start maximized even if it was maximized when you last quit it.
However, if you start WordPad by itself (not by double-clicking an associated
file type), WordPad does start maximized if you last quit it while maximized.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WordPad is a Microsoft Foundation Class Libraries (MFC) program that uses the
MFC dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). WordPad does not start maximized on some
computers when you perform a single operation that both starts WordPad and
instructs WordPad to load a specified file.

The problem occurs as soon as you install Windows NT, including service packs 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 6a.
