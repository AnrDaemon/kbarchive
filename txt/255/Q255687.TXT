SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the support guidelines for the System Stress Utility for
Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000, which was first distributed to MSDN
Professional and Universal subscribers in the January 2000 version, on disc 12
of the Development Platform English pack.

A brief overview of the System Stress Utility is on the CD-ROM under
.\Docs\stressCD.html. There is no formal documentation. This tool is unsupported
by Microsoft Technical Support, but you can e-mail bug reports to:

   WHQLSYS@microsoft.com

MORE INFORMATION
================

The System Stress Utility tests hardware under stress conditions. Most tests
involve running the utility for 48 hours. The utility sets up kernel mode
debugging in order to debug any hardware failures that happen during that time.
If there are no crashes or "blue screens" during the 48 hours, the hardware
"passes" the tests.
