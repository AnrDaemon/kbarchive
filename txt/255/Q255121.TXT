PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg osr2 win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you undock your laptop, your computer may stop responding (hang), or you
may receive the following error message:

   A fatal exception 0E has occurred in vxd ndis(01)

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you have a network adapter installed in the docking
station that uses device drivers that were released after the release of
Microsoft Windows 95, and the "Exists in all hardware profiles" feature is
enabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, use one of the following methods:

 - Click to clear the "Exists in all hardware profiles" check box to disable
   this feature before you undock your laptop.

 - Use the "Search for updated drivers" method in Device Manager to update the
   device driver instead of using the "Have Disk" method.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "Exists in all hardware profiles" feature is automatically selected if you
update device drivers by using the "Have Disk" method in Device Manager.

When you use the "Search for updated drivers" method to update device drivers,
the "Exists in all hardware profiles" check box is not automatically selected.
