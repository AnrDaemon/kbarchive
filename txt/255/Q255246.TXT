SYMPTOMS
========

On a computer running the Terminal Server Client program, when you try to
compose or open a new mail message, the following error message may appear:

   The item could not be displayed. The object could not be found.

CAUSE

This behavior can occur when you install the Windows Messaging program on the
Terminal Server computer but you do not run the Windows Messaging compatibility
script.

To resolve this behavior, on the computer where Terminal Server is installed,
remove Windows Messaging, change to Install mode, reinstall Windows Messaging,
and then run the Windows Messaging compatibility script.

1. Log on as an Administrator, and then remove the Windows Messaging program for
   all users.

2. Restart the computer, and log on as an Administrator.

3. Put the computer into Install mode:

   a. Start an MS-DOS command prompt.

   b. Type the following at the command prompt, and then press ENTER:

   change user /install

4. Install the Windows Messaging program.

5. Run the Windows Messaging compatibility script (Winmsg.cmd).

6. Type the following at the command prompt to put the computer into Execute
   mode:

   change user /execute

7. Log off, and then log back on as a user.

You should now be able to open and compose mail.
