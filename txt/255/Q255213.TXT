TITLE   :Hewlett-Packard HP4000 Print Drivers May Hang the Print Queue
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the HP4000 print drivers provided by Hewlett-Packard, the print
spooler and print queue may periodically stop responding (hang).

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, use the Microsoft version of either the HP4si or
the HP5si print driver from the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM, instead of the
HP4000 driver provided by Hewlett-Packard.
