TITLE   :XADM: Inappropriate Authentication with Mailbox Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Server Selection tab for the Mailbox Manager utility may not list the
available servers in the site. Under Servers, the following is displayed:

   LDAP: Inappropriate Authentication.

Mailbox Manager also processes mailboxes on the local server, but does not scan
mailboxes that are located on other servers.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if Microsoft Windows NT Challenge/Response has been removed
as a form of authentication from the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, when you need to modify the Server Selection tab, make
sure that Windows NT Challenge/Response authentication is enabled for LDAP on
the Authentication tab.
