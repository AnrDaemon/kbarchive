OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbActiveX kbCOMt kbCtrl kbvfp600 kbvfp600bug kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbCodeSnippet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 6.0, 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A form contains the ActiveX Rich Text control, a private Data Session, and has
ActiveX dual interface support disabled (this is the default setting in Visual
FoxPro 6.0). After pressing the ENTER key in the Rich Text control, the
following error appears and Visual FoxPro closes:

   Fatal error: Exception code: C0000005

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q316964 How to Obtain the Latest Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0 Service Pack

Do one of the following to work around this problem:

 - Change the private Data Session to the default Data Session. In the code
   example below, comment this line:

   DataSession = 2  

   and uncomment this line:

   * DataSession = 1

 - Enable ActiveX dual interface support by commenting this line:

    sys(2333,0)

   and uncommenting this line:

   * sys(2333,1)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in Microsoft Visual
FoxPro for Windows 7.0 Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a program that contains the following code and run it:

   CLOSE DATA ALL
   CLEAR ALL
   SYS(2333,0)
   *SYS(2333,1)

   PUBL ox
   ox = CREATEOBJECT('form1')
   ox.ADDOBJECT('IL1', 'olecontrol', 'RICHTEXT.Richtextctrl.1')
   ox.il1.CONTROLSOURCE = "ctemp.m1"
   ox.il1.HEIGHT = 100
   ox.il1.VISIBLE = .T.
   ox.SHOW

   DEFINE CLASS form1 AS FORM
       DATASESSION = 2
       * DATASESSION = 1
       PROCEDURE LOAD
       CREATE CURSOR ctemp (m1 m)
       INSERT INTO ctemp VALUES ("this is a test")
   ENDPROC
       PROCEDURE UNLOAD
       CLOSE DATA ALL
   ENDPROC
   ENDDEFINE

2. Place the cursor at the end of the line in the Rich Text control box.

3. Press ENTER.

The error in the "Symptoms" section appears and Visual FoxPro closes. The
behavior also happens in Visual FoxPro 6.0 with Service Pack 3 installed. This
behavior does not occur in Visual FoxPro 5.0 because the ControlSource property
is not exposed.
