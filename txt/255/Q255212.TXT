TITLE   :Event Viewer Records Event ID 8020 Errors for DSMN
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Event Viewer records the following Event ID 8020 error message for the Directory
Service Manager for NetWare (DSMN):

   Event ID 8020
   The synch agent services failed to modify account [username] on the NetWare
   server [servername] due to error 10256
   The synch agent services failed to modify account [username] on the NetWare
   server [servername] due to error 10239

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, do one of the following:

1. Remove the specified user account from the NetWare-based server. DSMN then
   recreates the account as part of the normal synchronization.

2. Remove the NetWare-based server from DSMN management, and then add it back.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine what DSMN action caused the error, subtract 10001 from the error
(10256 - 10001) or (10239 - 10001), and convert the decimal number to
hexadecimal. The hexadecimal number is the NetWare error returned to DSMN by
NetWare when the error occurred.

The error 10239 maps to a NetWare error of 238(EE), which maps to
ERROR_OBJECT_ALREADY_EXISTS. The error 10256 maps to a generic NetWare error of
255(FF). This can be any of several errors, depending on the DSMN actions.
