SYMPTOMS
========

When you remove the Software Inventory agent on a Systems Management Server
(SMS) 2.0 client, a blank registry key may be left in the registry. This makes
it appear as if the Software Inventory agent is still installed, but without any
status in the Systems Management tool in Control Panel. The registry key that is
left is:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Client\Client Components\Software
   Inventory Agent

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this issue, manually remove the Software Inventory Agent key under
the following location:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Client\Client Components

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
