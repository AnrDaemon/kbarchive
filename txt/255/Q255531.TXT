This article describes how to add and remove the interior cockpit views in
Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000.

MORE INFORMATION

By default, the interior cockpit views for each aircraft are stored in the

   Games\FS2000\Aircraft\<aircraft>\Panel

where <drive> is the drive letter for the hard disk on which Flight
Simulator 2000 is installed, and <aircraft> is the the name of the folder
for an installed aircraft.

For example, the interior cockpit views for the Boeing 737-400 are stored by
default in the following folder:

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\FS2000\AIRCRAFT\B737_400\PANEL

The interior cockpit views are bitmap (.bmp) files, and are named:

 - Forward_left.bmp

 - Forward_right.bmp

 - Left.bmp

 - Rear.bmp

 - Rear_left.bmp

 - Rear_right.bmp

 - Right.bmp

 - Up.bmp

To delete these views, open the Panels folder for the appropriate airplane and
