SUMMARY

This article describes how to set up public folder journaling for public folder
contacts.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To set up public folder journaling for public folder contacts:

1. Create both a Contacts and a Journal public folder.

2. In the properties of the Contacts public folder, click the Activities tab,
   click New, and then find the Journal public folder that you created in step 1
   and select it. Click OK.

3. Create a new journal entry in the Journal public folder, click Contact on the
   bottom left, and then choose a contact from the Contacts public folder that
   you created in step 1.

4. After you save the journal entry, open the contact and click the Activities
   tab. The journal entry is listed there. The autojournal feature is only
   available for personal mailboxes.

NOTE: For Contacts public folders, you can include only one folder in each
Activities group. For example, you cannot set up an Activities group that
includes both a Journal public folder and a Client Calendar public folder.
