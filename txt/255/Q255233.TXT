TITLE   :Windows NT 4.0 Enterprise Edition Domain Controllers May Hang
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Enterprise Edition-based domain controllers may
stop responding (hang) intermittently.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when you upgrade from a beta version of the operating
system but the beta versions of Mfc42.dll and Ntlgdsca.exe still remain in the
Smslogon\I386 folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, replace Mfc42.dll and Ntlgdsca.exe with the final
version of those files, from the Windows NT Server 4.0 Enterprise Edition
CD-ROM. Then either disable and re-enable Logon Discovery to replicate the
changes out to all Logon Points, or manually copy the files to each Logon Point
(which requires manually stopping the service on each Logon Point).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Smslogon\I386 folder appears only when Logon Discovery is enabled. The
folder does not appear if the Windows NT 4.0 client installation option is
enabled.
