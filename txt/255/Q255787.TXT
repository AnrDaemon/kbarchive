======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Metadirectory Services (MMS), full discovery of a Microsoft
Exchange site may take a long time.

CAUSE
=====

There are two issues that influence the performance characteristics of an
Exchange discovery:

 - When an Exchange Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) discovery
   encounters distribution lists (DLs) in leaf nodes, the DLs may be
   dereferenced object by object.

 - Attempts to discover the Microsoft DMD and Configuration containers are
   unsuccessful and the time-outs introduce a significant delay.

RESOLUTION
==========

To decrease the time it takes to perform a discovery, make the following
changes: If the search is a single-level search:

1. In the Action panel, click "Configure the Management Agent".

2. Click the Connected Directory Specifics tab.

3. Click the Advanced tab.

4. Click to clear the "Consider person and list entries as non-leaf nodes" check
   box.

If the search is a full tree search starting at the root:

1. In the Action panel, click "Configure the Management Agent".

2. Click the Connected Directory Specifics tab.

3. Click the Advanced tab.

4. Click the "DNs to Exclude During the Discovery" tab.

5. Type the distinguished names (DNs) of the Exchange schema extensions
   objects.

   Typically, these are:

   cn=Microsoft DMD,ou=<sitename>,o=<orgname>

   and

   cn=Configuration,ou=<sitename>,o=<orgname>


Please note the following items:

 - The discovery of the Microsoft DMD (Microsoft Directory Management domain)
   container introduces the most significant delay.

 - The non-leaf setting for users and lists is only effective when you perform
   single-level searches.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.
