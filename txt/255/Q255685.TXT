TITLE   :Error Message Discovering "Microsoft DMD" and "Configuration"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Metadirectory Services (MMS) version 2.1 (build 261), the following
error message is reported by the Exchange LDAP Management Agent (MA) when you
are discovering the "Microsoft DMD" and "Configuration" schema containers :

   Unknown LDAP search error - Microsoft DMD

   Unknown LDAP search error - Configuration

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when you are performing a full discovery on a Microsoft
Exchange site, beginning at the root. MMS 2.1 does not require that the schema
be explicitly discovered. In addition, it appears as though these two low-level
containers on the Exchange site are also invisible to the Exchange
Administration tool.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the MA configuration, hard-code the container names that should be excluded
during the discovery process. Do this by modifying the contents of
zcLdapExcludedHierarchy:

1. Click the Exchange LDAP Management Agent.

2. In the Actions panel, click Configure MA.

3. Click the Connected Directory Specifics tab.

4. Click the Advanced tab.

5. Click in the "DNs to Exclude during the Discovery" box.

6. Type the distinguished names of the "Microsoft DMD" and "Configuration"
   objects as they appear in the Exchange site.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
