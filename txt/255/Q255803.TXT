The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This "More Information" section of this article explains the naming convention
used when a compressed copy of a file is placed in the temporary folder (also
known as the cache directory) of an Internet Information Services computer that
has HTTP compression enabled.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Static HTML content is compressed and saved in the temporary directory by using
the following naming convention in order to avoid duplicate file names:

 - The file name begins with the following character string: $^~_
 - The compression algorithm ("gzip" or "deflate") followed by an underscore (_)
   is added next to the file name.
 - Finally, the absolute file path of the file on the local computer is added
   using an underscore (_) instead of a backslash (\).

For example, if the GZip compression algorithm is used on the Test.htm file,
located on the default Web site, the file name of the compressed copy would be
the following:

   $^~_gzip_c__inetpub_wwwroot_test.htm

General Information about the Temporary Folder and Compressed Files:

When a file has been requested, the compressed copy is stored in a temporary
folder and the compressed file is sent when further requests are received. Files
are not compressed prior to receiving a request for them.

Note: By default, the temporary folder is C:\WINNT\IIS Temporary Compressed
Files. This is specified on the Service tab in the "WWW Service Master
Properties for <ComputerName>" dialog box in the IIS snap-in.
