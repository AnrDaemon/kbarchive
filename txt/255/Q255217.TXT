TITLE   :Incorrect Output Printing from Client to Windows NT Server 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to print to a Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0-based print server
from a client computer running an earlier operating system, such as Microsoft
Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows for Workgroups, you may experience random
incorrect output. For example:

 - Bullets may not be printed correctly.

 - Bold titles may print as regular text, not bold.

 - Underlined text may be printed only as the underline, with no text.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, disable Enhanced Metafile (EMF) spooling on the
server. Follow these steps:

1. In the Printers folder, click the printer whose properties you want to
   change.

2. On the File menu, click Properties.

3. Click PrintProcessor.

4. Click Always Spool RAW Datatype.
