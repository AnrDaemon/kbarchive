SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to migrate a print server configuration between
Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0-based computers without having to reinstall the
printer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the Printmig.exe utility from Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit Supplement 3 to
first back up the print server configuration on the current print server and
then restore the configuration to the other Windows NT Server 4.0-based
computer.

You cannot use the Printmig.exe utility to migrate a print server configuration
between Windows NT 3.51-based computers or from a Windows NT 3.51-based computer
to a Windows NT 4.0-based computer because the two versions use different print
subsystems.
