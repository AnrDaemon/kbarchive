The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 SP5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If a Resource Monitor process experiences a problem and quits, the Cluster
service initiates another Resource Monitor process to control the resources of
the previous process. When this occurs, the following system event is logged:

   Event: 1116
   Source: Clussvc
   Description: The Cluster Resource Monitor died unexpectedly, an attempt will
   be made to restart it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 and earlier, a Resource Monitor process
problem results in an entry in the Cluster Diagnostic log file, but no entry in
the System event log. With Service Pack 5 or later, the event is logged in the
System event log. Such a problem is rare, and may indicate problems within a
third-party resource dynamic-link library (DLL).

If a Resource Monitor quits, regardless of which service pack is installed, the
following error message appears in the Cluster Diagnostic log file (if logging
is enabled) and a new Resource Monitor is created to replace it:

   [FM] Resource monitor terminated!

Additional query words: mscs fail failure
