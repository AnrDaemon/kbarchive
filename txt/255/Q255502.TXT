======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a WebClass (IIS Application) in Visual Basic 6.0 under Windows
2000, the following error message appears in the browser:

   Server object, ASP 0178 (0x800A0005) The call to Server.CreateObject failed
   while checking permissions. Access is denied to this object.

This error only occurs when you run the WebClass from within the Visual Basic
integrated development environment (IDE). It does not occur when you run the
WebClass in a compiled state.

CAUSE
=====

The authenticating user, usually the IUSR_<computername> account if you
use anonymous access, does not have the appropriate permissions to access the
DCOM Server (VB6.exe in this case). When you debug WebClasses in the Visual
Basic IDE, the "launching user" is the Interactive user and the user who is
accessing the DCOM Server is the "authenticating user."

Because there is no DCOM entry for VB6.exe, DCOM uses the default permissions. In
Windows 2000, the DCOM default access permissions are only given to the System
account and the launching user by default. Because the launching user and the
user accessing the DCOM Server are not the same, the error occurs.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, add a DCOM entry for VB6.exe into the registry.
This will enable you to set specific DCOM permissions for debugging WebClasses
in Visual Basic. The instructions for doing this are in the following Microsoft
Knowledge Base article:

   Basic IDE with an ASP Client

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior does not occur in Windows NT 4.0 and Internet Information Server
(IIS) 4.0.
