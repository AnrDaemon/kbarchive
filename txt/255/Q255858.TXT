SYMPTOMS
========

The display of multiline text in rich edit controls may be truncated when
Chinese, Japanese, or Korean fonts are used.

CAUSE
=====

There has been a change in the behavior of rich edit controls under Windows 2000
when Chinese, Japanese, or Korean fonts are used. In earlier versions, there is
no spacing between lines. With the intention of increasing readability, lines
are now spaced slightly apart. This can truncate displays if the computation of
the rectangle for the control does not take this change into account.

RESOLUTION
==========

The behavior in earlier versions can be recovered; the following code fragment
suggests a method:

   	PARAFORMAT2 pf;
   	ZeroMemory((void*)&pf, sizeof(pf));
   	pf.cbSize = sizeof(pf);
   	pf.dwMask = PFM_LINESPACING;
   	pf.dyLineSpacing=lfWeight;
   	pf.bLineSpacingRule = 4;
   	::SendMessage(m_field.m_hWnd, EM_SETPARAFORMAT, 0, (LPARAM)&pf);

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
