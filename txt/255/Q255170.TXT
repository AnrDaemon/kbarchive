KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbClient kbConfig kbMMC _IK964 kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsmsAdmin kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Microsoft Windows 95 client may not accept the remote reboot command from the
Administrator UI if the desktop size is set at or above 1024x768. The computers
remain indefinitely at the following screen:

   Windows is now shutting down

CAUSE
=====

The Remote Reboot utility within Systems Management Server Remote Tools
generates a remote API call to request the reboot. This has been known to occur
on systems with but not limited to the Intel 810 and Matrox Millennium II AGP
display adapters.

WORKAROUND
==========

The client desktop resolution must be reduced to a setting of 800x600 or less.
Such settings still offer high color, while allowing the remote reboot to
function.

This behavior does not occur on Microsoft Windows 98 or Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
clients.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
