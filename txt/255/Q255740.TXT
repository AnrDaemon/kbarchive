TITLE   :"Invalid Connector DN" Error Message Trying to Run Exchange MA
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services, version 2.1 
 - Zoomit VIA, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If an you copy a Management Agent (MA) control script from an existing,
functional Microsoft Exchange MA to a new Exchange MA, you may receive an
"Invalid Connector DN" error message when you run the script.

This behavior may occur if you create the MA in the following manner:

1. Copy the templates from the existing MA.

2. Update the new MA.

3. Change information related to the second Exchange site.

The discovery of the connected directory succeeds, but the synchronization with
the metadirectory does not succeed and generates numerous "Invalid Connector DN"
and possibly also "Skip Unknown Line" messages in the log file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior can occur if your import file and Add Parsing template are out of
synchronization. The metadirectory synchronization process is sensitive to the
order of the lines in the parsing templates.

Each line in the import file should have a corresponding line in the Add Parsing
template, and the corresponding lines in the two files should be in the same
order.

It is possible to specify "no order" for the lines in the parsing template, but
there is significant cost in terms of performance when doing this. For further
information, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q252997 How to Specify No Order in Parsing Templates

To determine the problem location in the template, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Operator's log and find the first record with skipped lines.

2. Note the record before it also.

3. Open the import file and find the record.

4. Compare it with the previous record and find the extra attribute(s).

Your add templates need to have these attributes included so that it does not
start skipping lines.

Additional query words: metadirectory, via, zoomit, exchange
