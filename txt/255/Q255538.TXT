TITLE   :Code 19008 (DS_RC_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL) When You Run a Join Search
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool MMS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The search buffer that is available for Joins is limited to attribute values of
254 characters or less. If an attribute is listed as a search candidate and a
candidate record contains a value which exceeds 254 characters, the join
proposal does not work. Also, the Genlogs file contains the following entry:

   19008 DS_RC_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the size of the search buffer is set to 255
characters.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

1. Identify the offending attribute by analyzing the "attributes to search on"
   area on the "Configure the Join" tab.

2. Use either of the following methods to correct all of the records with
   instances of the offending attribute that exceed the threshold size:

 - Decrease the size of the attribute value until it is below 254 characters.

 - Remove the attribute as a search attribute.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
