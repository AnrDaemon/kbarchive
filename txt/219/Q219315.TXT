 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4

SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure a computer running Microsoft Windows Internet Name Service
(WINS) for WINS replication with more than 255 other WINS servers, the WINS
service may stop responding (hang) and the following error may appear in the
Event Viewer log:

   The Database has been found to be inconsistent. More specifically, the number
   of owners found in the Name Address Mapping table are different from the
   number found in the Owner Address Mapping table.

CAUSE
=====

The WINS service tracks other WINS servers in the replication matrix by using a
table in the WINS database. This table maps the IP addresses of all other WINS
servers to a unique ID number. Each WINS server numbers itself as 0 and assigns
other numbers incrementally to new WINS servers as they are discovered through
replication. When the table increases past 255 entries, the server removes
entries from the owner to IP address mapping table. The number of owners in the
Name Address Mapping table and the Owner Address Mapping table are then
inconsistent and WINS cannot start.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
