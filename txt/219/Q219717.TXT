TITLE   :NTOP Has Not Been Tested with the Current Configuration
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During the installation of the Windows NT Option Pack on a computer running
Windows NT Server 4.0 with Service Pack (SP) 4 installed, a notification box is
displayed indicating that the Windows NT Option Pack has not been tested with
the current configuration.

During the unattended installations of the Windows NT Option Pack, this
notification causes the installation to stop. The INF file for the unattended
installation of the Windows NT Option Pack does not contain any parameters for
acknowledging this pop-up notification, which causes the unattended installation
to fail.

CAUSE
=====

When the Windows NT Option Pack installs, the Setup program checks the OS to
confirm that SP3 is installed. If SP3 is not installed, the installation stops.
If the version check results in versions later than SP3, such as SP4, the pop-up
warning occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in

Edition Service Pack 5.

MORE INFORMATION

location, and then, replace the Iis.dll and Preload.exe files from the Windows
NT Option Pack compact disc with the Iis.dll and Preload.exe files from the
