TITLE   :XFOR: Parsing Problem with LinkAge and cc:Mail Connector
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - LinkAge Message Exchange, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The LinkAge Message Exchange 3.2 cc:Mail Connector may not correctly parse user
names during the directory synchronization (dirsync) process.

The problem may occur if there is a cc:Mail postoffice that has been included in
the dirsync process using the "include" statement in the Linkage.ini file under
the LME-CCMAIL-CXA section. If the include statement completely contains the
postoffice definition of an Exchange Server user, that user may not be
replicated to cc:Mail.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
