TITLE   :Cannot Obtain Lease with DHCP Scopes Using Multicast Addresses
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0 SP3,4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you have a computer running Windows NT 4.0 Server using Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP), computers on your network may not be able to
obtain a lease.

In addition, computers configured as DHCP clients that have already obtained a
lease may not function properly.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when you create a DHCP scope using DHCP Manager, and
specify a class D TCP/IP address (multicast group address). DHCP scopes cannot
contain class D TCP/IP multicast addresses.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the TCP/IP address space, class D addresses are reserved for multicast
groups. The address range is 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255. Class D addresses are
not segregated into network and host units. Some class D multicast groups are
reserved.

For additional information about DHCP, scopes, and multicasting, please refer to
the following Request for Comment (RFC) documents:

   Dynamic RFC1541: Host Control Protocol

   RFC1112: Host Extensions for IP Multicasting
