TITLE   :IPX Router Does Not Increase Transport Control Field
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0,4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Normally, when an IPX packet is propagated by the router, the Transport Control
(TC) field is increased by 1. The router does not propagate any packets with
TC=16. This guarantees that IPX packetets do not go further than 16 hops from
the source. When the TC is not incremented, packets (especially broadcasts) are
propagated an infinite number of hops, which has the potential to create huge
network storms.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because this functionality was lost with Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 4.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
4.0 or the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest
