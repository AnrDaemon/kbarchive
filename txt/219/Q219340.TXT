TITLE   :Unable to Read Files from a Remote LANMAN 2.1 Compatible Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server versions 4.0, 4.0a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you read a file list from a remote LAN Manager 2.1-compatible server (for
example, an OS/2 server) where the folder you are reading contains multiple
files with names longer than 128 characters, the list of files displayed may not
contain all files in the remote shared folder.

This does not affect folders shared on computers running Windows NT.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when there are multiple files on the shared folder with
names longer than 128 characters. The internal buffers in the Windows NT
redirector code does not account for the possiblity of these large names. The
buffers have been expanded in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5 to account for the
largest possible names on these systems.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:

STATUS

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0. This problem was
first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5.
