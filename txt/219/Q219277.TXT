SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to load balance traffic to Web servers using Windows
NT Load Balancing Service (WLBS).

MORE INFORMATION
================

To load balance traffic to Web servers, perform the following steps:

1. Web servers typically listen on port 80. Configure one port rule on all
   cluster hosts for a port range of 80 to 80 and select Both for protocols (TCP
   and UDP).

2. Click to select Multiple Hosts. Affinity should be set to None, unless the
   Web server maintains client state in its memory, in which case Affinity must
   be set to either Single or Class C.

If you want to load balance HTTP over SSL (encrypted Web traffic), you need to
configure a rule for this type of traffic; usually, the port is 443. Us the
following steps:

1. Set up a rule for a port range of 443 to 443, both TCP and UDP.

2. Set Affinity to either Single or Class C to ensure that the client
   connections are always handled by the server that has the SSL session
   established.
