TITLE   :NDIS Does Not Indicate NDIS_RESET_END Status
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a computer running Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4, the Microsoft Network
Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) software does not notify any protocols
bound to a miniport driver that the miniport has completed its reset routine.
The NDIS_RESET_START command is issued during a reset, but no command is issued
at the completion of the reset. Previous versions of NDIS notified the protocol
bound to the miniport at both the beginning (using NDIS_RESET_START) and the end
(with NDIS_RESET_END) during a reset.

RESOLUTION
==========
