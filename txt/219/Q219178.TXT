TITLE   :SFM Macintosh Clients Print %%[Error: undefined...]%%
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Macintosh clients try printing to a print queue defined on an Windows NT
Server 4.0 computer running Services for Macintosh, you may find that their
print job appears in the print queue as it is being spooled, and then clears the
queue as if it has actually finished printing.

No errors will appear on the Windows NT Server computer or on the Macintosh
client, which looks as if the document printed successfully. But, when viewing
the printed output, the only thing printed on the page is:

   %%[Error: undefined; OffendingCommand: Volume ]%%
   %%[Flushing; rest of job (to end-of-file) will be ignored ]%%

CAUSE
=====

This error may occur when Macintosh clients send print jobs to an SFM printer
that is using drivers that are not made specifically for the model of printer
being used; for example, using the HP LaserJet 4M driver for the HP LaserJet 4
printer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, make sure you have the correct drivers installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Also make sure the Macintosh client has the latest Apple Laser Writer 8 driver
installed.
