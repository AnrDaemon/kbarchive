TITLE   :SP4 RAS Server Hangs Up When RAS Client Tries to Connect
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 RAS client tries to connect to a RAS server
computer running Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 4, the RAS server
unexpectedly hangs up the connection.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Ndiswan.sys driver for the RAS server in this
particular hardware configuration becomes deadlocked. The deadlock occurs in the
code that causes the NdisWanSend() API call to quit without contacting the RAS
client. The RAS server then hangs up.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:
