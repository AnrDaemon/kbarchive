TITLE   :Unexpected Print Results When Printer Is Turned On After Startup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0a,4.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server versions 4.0, 4.0a, 4.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Print jobs are not printed completely if the printer is not turned on and in an
online status before Windows NT starts. An error message is displayed indicating
the printer is not available.

CAUSE
=====

The parallel port driver sends data to the LPT port without first checking the
status of the printer. If the printer is powered off, the sent data is lost.
When the printer is subsequently turned on, the parallel port driver sends the
rest of the data (because the driver assumes the initial portion was received
successfully). The result is incorrect output or the inability to print.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

first corrected in Windows NT version 4.0 Service Pack 5.
