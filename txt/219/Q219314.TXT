computer that has the Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP) service installed,
TCP/IP addresses in one or more DHCP scopes may be displayed as "BAD". Entire

router), is not functioning properly, or the DHCP service receives an Internet
Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packet coded with the destination unreachable
flag.
