The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

Submitted print jobs are deleted after you restart your computer or after the
Print Spooler service is restarted.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you restart the computer because the Print Spooler
service deletes print jobs if they appear to be corrupted. For documents that
previously went through a cycle of printing, restarting, and printing, the
spooler incorrectly determines that the job is corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:

STATUS

first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5.
