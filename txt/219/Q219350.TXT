SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5 on an Alpha-based
computer, you cannot use the dual-boot feature to install a secondary copy of
Windows NT on another drive partition.

CAUSE

This behavior occurs if you click No when you are prompted to overwrite the
Hal.dll and Atapi.sys files during the original installation. The older files
that are not overwritten cannot support the dual-boot option.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, click Yes when you are prompted to overwrite the
Hal.dll and Atapi.sys files.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
