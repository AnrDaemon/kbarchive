 - Nothing may happen.

 - A black window may be displayed.

 - A white window may be displayed.

 - You may receive one of the following error messages:

       - MMSYSTEM296: The file cannot be played on the specified MCI device. The
      file may be corrupt, or not in the correct format.

This behavior can occur if either of the following conditions are true:

   player installed on your computer.
