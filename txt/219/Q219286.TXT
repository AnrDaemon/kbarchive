TITLE   :Appointments Are Not Deleted from OWA When Using Netscape
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Netscape's browser cannot delete more than one appointment per session. No error
messages are returned nor any indication of a problem is given.


CAUSE
=====

By default, Netscape enables Disk Cache and Memory Cache, causing the page not
to expire therefore, reloading a local copy of the page.

RESOLUTION
==========

One solution is to turn off the cache by setting the disk cache and memory cache
values to zero. Another, less intrusive solution, is to flush the cache before
reloading the frame. Netscape Navigator 4.5 has command buttons to do this for
you. If you have any problems locating the cache settings, contact Netscape.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Network trace information shows that Netscape sends a "Get" request that does
not include the "no-cache" directive. This allows "stale" information to
remain.
. For more information, please refer to RFC 1945.

Note: Internet Explorer uses the "no-cache" directive and also "expires" the page
immediately.
