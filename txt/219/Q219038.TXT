SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT Load Balancing Service (WLBS) can be disabled for troubleshooting
purposes or because a computer is not going to participate in cluster operations
for an extended period of time. Follow these steps to disable WLBS:

NOTE: Cluster Adapter is the network interface card (NIC) used for cluster
traffic; it is not the WLBS Virtual NIC adapter.

1. In Control Panal, double-click Network, and then click the Bindings tab.

2. Under "Show Bindings For", select "All Protocols".

3. Disable the binding from the WLBS driver protocol to the network adapter.

4. Disable the binding from the TCP/IP and WINS Client protocols to the WLBS
   Virtual NIC adapter.

5. If you are using multiple adapters and if you plan to use this adapter to
   handle TCP/IP and WINS Client traffic, enable the binding from the TCP/IP and
   WINS Client protocols to the cluster adapter.

6. Click OK to close the dialog box.

7. Restart the computer.

To fully remove the WLBS software, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panal, double-click Network, and then click the Adapters tab.

2. Select the WLBS Virtual NIC Driver.

3. Click Remove.

4. Examine and modify (if needed) the bindings from the TCP/IP and WINS Client
   protocols to the cluster adapter as preferred.

5. Click OK to close the dialog box.

6. Remove the following files from the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder:

    - Wlbs.exe

    - Wlbs.dll

    - Wlbs.hlp

    - Wlbs.cnt

    - Wlbs.sys

7. Remove the following file from the %SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers folder:

    - Wlbs.sys

8. Restart the computer.
