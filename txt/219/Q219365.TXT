SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4), the following
error message may be displayed:

   Service Pack Setup Error
   You do not have enough free disk space to install the Service Pack. The
   Service Pack requires 40 MB, or 80 MB if you choose to also backup files for
   uninstall.

This error message may be displayed even though the computer has the amount of
free space on its boot partition that the message indicates is not present.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because SP4 may require up to 60 MB of free disk space, or
120 MB if you choose to also backup files for uninstallation.

RESOLUTION

To resolve this problem, increase the amount of free disk space in the partition
where Windows NT is installed to at least 60 MB (if you do not want to create an
uninstallation folder), or to 120 MB (if you want to create an uninstallation
folder).


This problem does not occur in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0. For
