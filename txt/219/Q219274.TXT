SUMMARY
=======

You cannot export the campaign "The First Punic War" from the trial version of
Rise of Rome into the full retail version of Microsoft Age of Empires Expansion:
The Rise of Rome.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is designed to reduce the size and download time of the trial
version of Rise of Rome.

Although the file "The First Punic War.cpx" appears to be a valid Rise of Rome
campaign file, it does not contain all of the data required for game play in the
full retail version of the Age of Empires Expansion: The Rise of Rome software.
