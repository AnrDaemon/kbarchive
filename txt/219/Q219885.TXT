SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) includes a feature that you can use to
reboot the computer quickly by pressing SHIFT+CTRL+ALT+DELETE.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To enable the Quick Reboot feature, add a REG_SZ value named EnableQuickReboot
with a data value of 1 in the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

After you make this change, quit Registry Editor and restart the computer.

Note that rebooting the computer by using the SHIFT+CTRL+ALT+DELETE key
combination does not shut down the computer gracefully and creates an
"unexpected shutdown (event 6008)" message in the event log.

For more information about event 6008, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q196452 Why WinNT Reports 6005, 6006, 6008, and 6009 Event Log Entries
