SYMPTOMS
========

When you copy text that includes tracked changes from one Word document and
paste the text into another Word document, the pasted text no longer contains
the indications of revisions that were made in the original document
(underlining, bolding, strikethrough, or font color).

For example, this problem occurs when you do the following:

1. In Microsoft Word, type some text in a new document.

2. Turn on "Track changes while editing". To do this, point to Track Changes on
   the Tools menu, and then click Highlight Changes. In the Highlight Changes
   dialog box, click to select the "Track changes when editing" check box, and
   then click OK.

3. Make some changes to the text by adding or deleting text.

4. Turn off "Track changes while editing". To do this, point to Track Changes on
   the Tools menu, and click Highlight Changes. In the Highlight Changes dialog
   box, click to clear the "Track changes when editing" check box, and then
   click OK.

5. Select the text, including the revised text.

6. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

7. In a new Word document, click Paste on the Edit menu.
