TITLE   :"Warning! Your Drive May Be Corrupt" Starting Windows NT 4.0 SP4
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) installed, you may see the
following message when Chkdsk runs during a restart of Windows NT:

   WARNING! Your drive may be corrupt. Please let AUTOCHK run.
   Skipping AUTOCHK on a volume may lead to an unmountable volume.
   Skipping AUTOCHK on a system drive may lead to an unusable system.
   AUTOCHK resumed.

The following message may also appear in your event viewer's Application log:

   Event ID: 1001
   Source: Autochk
   Description: WARNING! Your drive may be corrupt. Please let AUTOCHK run.
   Skipping AUTOCHK on a volume may lead to an unmountable volume.
   Skipping AUTOCHK on a system drive may lead to an unusable system.
   AUTOCHK resumed.

CAUSE
=====

This message has been added to Chkdsk starting with SP4. It does not necessarily
indicate that there is any problem on the hard disk. It is a warning that
skipping Autochk (the automatic running of Chkdsk after an improper shutdown)
might lead to problems on your hard disk. When a Windows NT-based computer is
shut down improperly (for example, by a power failure), Autochk scans the hard
disk the next time you start Windows NT.

This message is displayed and is recorded in the Application log every time
Chkdsk is run during startup, whether it was invoked by Autochk or manually by
the user.
