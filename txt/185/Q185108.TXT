The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Internet Mail Connector (Exchange Server 4.0) or Internet Mail
Service (Exchange Server 5.0 and 5.5) for directory replication with another
site, the following error may be generated in the application log, even if the
Internet Mail Connector diagnostic logging is set to None.

   Event ID 4132
   Source MSExchangeIMC
   Type Error
   Category Internal Processing

   Description: The Internet Mail Service has failed attempting to deliver a
   report or system message and is deleting it, the spool file name can be found
   in the data section of this Event and this file can be found in the ARCHIVE
   directory.

   Event ID 2001
   Source MSExchangeIMC
   Type Information
   Category Message Transfer

   Description: Deliver of message <Message Tracking number@Computer
   Name.DNS.Org.com> from <Computer Name-DSA@Site.org.com> in temporary
   file "Spool File Name" was attempted to host(s) <unknown> [For Remote
   Domain.com] with 0 recipients delivered and 1 undeliverable.

   Event ID 2006
   Source MSExchangeIMC
   Type Warning
   Category SMTP Interface Events

   Description: Can't resolve the Host <unknown> [for remote Domain.com] in
   order to deliver one or more messages.

CAUSE
=====

One possible cause may be incorrect information in the Routing Address tab of
the Connected Sites property page of the Internet Mail Connector. These errors
may also be logged when the Internet Mail Connector is not able to resolve the
remote Internet Mail Connector domain name or IP address. You should try
verifying entries in DNS Manager.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform the following:

 - Verify that the Routing Address tab in the Connected Sites property page of
   the Internet Mail Connector includes the correct information.

 - Make sure the DNS entries, "A record and MX record" are correct for the
   Exchange sites.
