SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the ActiveDocument.SaveAs method to save a document and you specify
the name of a file that already exists for the FileName argument, Microsoft Word
overwrites the existing file without warning.

WORKAROUND

To work around this problem, use the following Microsoft Visual Basic for
Applications sample macro.

The following macro tests to see whether the file you intend to save (Save as)
already exists in the current folder. If it does, it prompts you with a message
asking whether you want to overwrite the existing file. Clicking Yes overwrites
the file with the new file. Clicking No displays the Save as dialog box,
allowing you to enter a different name for the file.

   Sub SaveAsExample()
      Dim strSaveAsName As String
      Dim strMsg As String
      '
      ' Replace the following document name "MyDoc.Doc" with
      ' the name you want to use to "Save As."
      strSaveAsName = "MyDoc.Doc"

      ' Message to return if file exists.
      strMsg = "Do you want to replace the existing " & strSaveAsName & "?"

      ' Check if the file exists.
      If Dir(strSaveAsName & "*") = "" Then
         ' If file does not exist, save without prompting.
         ActiveDocument.SaveAs FileName:=strSaveAsName
      Else
         ' If file does exist, prompt with warning message.
         ' Check value of button clicked in message box.
         Select Case MsgBox(strMsg, vbYesNoCancel + vbExclamation)
            Case vbYes
               ' If Yes was chosen, save and overwrite existing file.
               ActiveDocument.SaveAs FileName:=strSaveAsName
            Case vbNo
               ' If No was chosen, prompt for file name
               ' using the File SaveAs dialog box.
               With Dialogs(wdDialogFileSaveAs)
                  .Name = ""
                  .Show
               End With
            Case Else
            ' If Cancel was chosen, do nothing.
         End Select
      End If
   End Sub
