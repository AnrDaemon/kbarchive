KEYWORDS:kbenv kbsound kbimu msgame mtm2kbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Monster Truck Madness 2, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you adjust the volume in Monster Truck Madness 2, the volume of the video
clips that play at the end of each race is not affected.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the volume of the video clips is controlled by the
volume setting in Microsoft Windows, not by the volume setting in Monster Truck
Madness 2.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, adjust the volume of the video clips by adjusting the
Windows volume setting. To do this, follow these steps:

NOTE: Changing the Windows volume setting changes the volume for all sounds in
Windows.

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Multimedia.

3. On the Audio tab, move the Volume slider in the Playback area to the volume
   level you want, and then click OK.

4. Close Control Panel.
