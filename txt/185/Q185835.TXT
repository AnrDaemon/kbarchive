To resolve this issue use the following methods.

Configure Display Settings to Use the Correct Monitor
-----------------------------------------------------

To configure your computer's display settings to use the correct monitor:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Display.

3. On the Settings tab, click Change Display Type.

   NOTE: If you are using Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2),
   click Advanced Properties.

4. Under Monitor, click Change.

   NOTE: If you are using OSR2, click the Monitor tab, and then click Change.

5. Click Show All Devices.

6. In the Manufacturers box, click your monitor manufacturer.

7. In the Models box, click your monitor model.

8. Click OK, and then click Close.

If the issue continues to occur, change the refresh rate of your monitor.

Change the Refresh Rate of Your Monitor
---------------------------------------

NOTE: You cannot change the refresh rate of your monitor using most Windows 95
video drivers. However, some third-party vendors provide software utilities that
provide this functionality.

To determine if you can change the refresh rate of your monitor:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Display.

3. On the Settings tab, click Change Display Type.

   NOTE: If you are using OSR2, click Advanced Properties.

   If you see a Refresh Rate box on the Adapter tab, you can manually change the
   refresh rate for your monitor.

   If you do not see an Adapter tab or a Refresh Rate box, follow the steps in
   the "Reduce the Hardware Acceleration" method later in this article.

To change the refresh rate for your monitor:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Display.

3. On the Settings tab, click Change Display Type.

   NOTE: If you are using OSR2, click Advanced Properties.

4. On the Adapter tab, click Adapter Default in the Refresh Rate box.

5. Click OK. If you are prompted to test the setting, click OK.

6. If the setting works correctly, click Yes to keep the setting. If the setting
   does not work correctly, click No, and then follow the steps in the "Reduce
   the Hardware Acceleration" method later in this article.

7. Click OK, and then close Control Panel.

Reduce the Hardware Acceleration
--------------------------------

To reduce the graphics hardware acceleration:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. On the Performance tab, click Graphics.

4. Move the Hardware Acceleration slider until it is one notch to the right of
   None (the Basic acceleration setting).

5. Click OK, and then click Close.

6. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.

NOTE: Microsoft recommends that you do not lower the hardware acceleration all
the way to None because some video cards do not work with this setting.
