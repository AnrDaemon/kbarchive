The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to export the directory entries for Microsoft Exchange
Server public folders.

The Microsoft Exchange Administrator program does not export public folder data.
In some cases, it may be useful to export the directory attributes associated
with public folders to manipulate this data and then import it back. You can
import the .csv file using the Exchange Administrator program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Dsexport.exe utility, which is available in the Microsoft Platform Software
Development Kit (SDK), can be used to export directory information about public
folders. Dsexport.exe is located in the Samples\Dbmsg\Exchange\Dsexport
directory.

Dsexport.exe has some command-line arguments that are not recognized by the
Microsoft Exchange Administrator Import\Export processor. It is these arguments
that make this tool particularly useful for dumping objects other than mailbox
or recipient container objects.

For more information about Dsexport.exe, consult the Microsoft Platform SDK
documentation.

Using Dsexport.exe:

Dsexport.exe outputs information into a text file as comma separated values
(CSV). If the target file exists prior to running Dsexport.exe, and this target
CSV file lists the name of each of the desired object attributes separated by
commas, the file is used as a template header file when Dsexport.exe is
executed. This provides the ability to control which object attributes are
dumped. If the CSV file does not exist, the file will be created with 13 basic
fields.

1. Copy Dsexport.exe to the \Exchsrvr\Bin directory.

2. In the \Exchsrvr\Bin directory, create a text file called PFlist.csv with
   only the following single line of text in it:

         Obj-Class,Directory Name,Display Name,E-mail Addresses
    

   You can add any other attribute you require to the above header line.

3. Execute the following command-line (all on one line) from the \Exchsrvr\Bin
   directory:

   dsexport /FILE=PFLIST.CSV /DSA=%1 /BASEPOINT=/o=%2/ou=%3
   /CLASSES=PUBLIC-FOLDER /HIDDEN /SUBTREE

   where:

   %1 = <local exchange servername> (Case sensitive)
   %2 = <organization name> (Case sensitive)
   %3 = <site name> (Case sensitive)

This will result in a PFList.csv file that includes one line for each public
folder in the site.

In order to export a list of all public folders in the entire Exchange
organization instead of for one particular site, use the following command line
(all on one line):

   "dsexport /FILE=PFLIST.CSV
   /DSA=%1/BASEPOINT=/o=%2/CLASSES=PUBLIC-FOLDER/HIDDEN /SUBTREE" (without the
   quotation marks)

Additional query words: print public folder hierarchy
