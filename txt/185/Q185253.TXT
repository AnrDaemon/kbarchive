TITLE   :Cryptographic Service Provider Not Working After Service Pack 3
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbProgramming kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Microsoft Windows NT Service Pack 3 when Microsoft Enhanced
Cryptographic Service Provider (CSP) and Microsoft CyrptoAPI versions 1.0 and
2.0 are installed on your computer, entries for the digital signature may be
damaged or missing from the registry. If the CSP is not properly registered, it
does not load and no error message is displayed.

The Advapi32.dll file, included with Windows NT Service Pack 3, may generate
either of the following error values:

 - 0x8009001A (NTE_KEYSET_ENTRY_BAD)

 - 0x80090006 (NTE_BAD_SIGNATURE)

RESOLUTION
==========

A fix to this problem is available that makes the necessary changes to the
registry. To obtain the fix, download the appropriate self-extracting executable
file:

+--------------------------------------------+
| File name    | Date    | Size   | Platform | 
+--------------------------------------------+
| Rsaalpha.exe | 7/15/97 | 23,244 | Alpha    | 
+--------------------------------------------+
| Rsax86.exe   | 7/15/97 | 23,243 | Intel    | 
+--------------------------------------------+

These files can be obtained from the following Microsoft FTP site:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/softlib/mslfiles

Each self-extracting executable file contains the following files:

 - Readme.txt

 - Rsaenh.reg

The Readme.txt file contains instructions about how to merge the required keys
into your registry, and the Rsaenh.reg file contains the registry key values
needed to resolve the problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT Service
Pack 3.
