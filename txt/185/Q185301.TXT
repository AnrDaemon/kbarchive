SYMPTOMS
========

If you have multiple hardware profiles configured, an option labeled "None of

computer. If you select "None of the Above," Plug and Play enumeration occurs,
and some devices may be reset to configurations that the drivers configured in
the hardware profiles cannot support. When this occurs, you may have to manually
reload the original device drivers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

This update replaces the hidden system file named Io.sys in the root folder of
the boot drive and allows you to remove the "None of the Above" option from the
list of hardware profiles presented when you start your computer. The update
adds the following registry key:

Key:        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\control\IDConfigDB
Value:      HideNoneOfAbove
Type:       Binary
Data Value: 01 00 00 00

To hide the "None of the Above" option, set the value as shown above. To display
the "None of the Above" option, remove the value or set it to "00 00 00 00."
