Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

This update offers the following improvements:

 - German infantry no longer use their Panzerfaust anti-tank weapons against
   Allied infantry.

 - The Soldier monitor now updates properly on the Macintosh.

 - You can no longer deduce enemy placements during deployment mode by watching
   for the targeting cursor while you drag a fire line.

 - Dead tank sprites no longer disappear.

 - Dead tanks continue to smoke.

 - It is easier to drive a tank straight down a road. They are also less likely
   to expose their side to the enemy during the middle of a move order.

 - Anti-tank guns placed in multi-story buildings are assumed to be on the
   ground floor and don't get LOS advantages from higher floors.

 - Tanks now can move onto the Arnhem bridge.

 - Mortars on "Defend" or when controlled by the AI were too accurate. Now they
   target an area, not individual men.
