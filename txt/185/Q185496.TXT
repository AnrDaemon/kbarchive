TITLE   :Changing IP/Port on SSL Web May Require Key Manager Change

SUMMARY
=======

When a server certificate is applied to an Internet Information Server version
4.0 (IIS) Web server, the server certificate must be bound to the IP address and
port number. If there are multiple certificates loaded but not bound, the server
may not use the certificate correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Secure Socket Layer (SSL) connections may fail if the settings in Key Manager
are incorrect. By default, Key Manager sets up IIS to use the certificate on all
unassigned IP addresses and all unassigned ports. Unassigned means IP addresses
or Port combinations are not currently bound to a certificate.

If you bind a certificate to a specific IP address or Port and then change the IP
or Port combination of the Web server, you must also change the setting in Key
Manager.

Example: If you have a Web server, www.myserver.com, on IP address 10.56.65.200
and port 443 (for SSL traffic), the server certificate must also be bound to
10.56.65.200:443.

However, if you change the server address to 10.56.65.201:443, you must also
change the setting to 10.56.65.201:443 in Key Manager. If you do not, IIS does
not service requests for the new IP address and Port because it is still bound
to 10.56.65.200:443.
