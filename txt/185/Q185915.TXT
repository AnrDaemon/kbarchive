TITLE   :SMS: Background Bitmaps Slow WinNT Remote Control Performance
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Windows NT clients that have large, full-color background bitmaps on
the desktop can cause Remote Control to perform very slowly.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT Remote Control is based on the transfer of individual blocks of
screen area, including the desktop background. Consequently, a large amount
desktop background bitmap data may be sent over the network connection during a
remote control session. There is currently no method to disable transfer of
background bitmaps by the remote control component in Systems Management Server.

WORKAROUND
==========

To prevent slow performance related to large bitmaps, ensure that the client
does not use a background bitmap on the desktop.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
