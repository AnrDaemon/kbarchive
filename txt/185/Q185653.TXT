Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Make sure that you have Microsoft Exchange installed on the test computer and
   have created a valid Exchange Profile.

2. Create a program file and type the following code:

         oleMAPISession = CREATEOBJECT( "MSMAPI.MAPISession" )
         oleMAPIMessage = CREATEOBJECT( "MSMAPI.MAPIMessages" )
         WITH oleMAPISession
            .Signon()
               IF ( .SessionID > 0 )
                  oleMAPIMessage.SessionID = .SessionID
                  ACTIVATE WINDOW watch
                  oleMAPIMessage.FETCH()
                  SUSPEND
               ENDIF
          ENDWITH

3. Save and run the program.

4. When the Debug window opens (this may take a minute depending the speed of
   the computer), enter "oleMapiMesssage" (without the quotation marks) in the
   Watch window.

5. Expand the MAPI control (oleMapiMessage) and scroll down or up in the Watch
   window.

At this point, you will get an Application error and Visual FoxPro shuts down.
