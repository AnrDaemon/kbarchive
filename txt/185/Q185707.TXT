TITLE   :Allow Assignment of an LU to a User and Workstation
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2,3.0 SP3,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you assign LUs/Pools to a workstation and select the "Allow Access to
Workstation Resources Only" option, any user who logs on to that workstation has
access to that LU.

Also note that if you assign LUs/Pools to a user with no limits on the
workstation, the user can log on to any workstation and get a session.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design in Microsoft SNA Service versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0
SP2, 3.0 SP3, and 4.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, 3.0 SP2, and 3.0 SP3. We are researching this problem in versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, 3.0 SP2, and 3.0 SP3 and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 4.0. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for SNA Server
version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can now configure any 3270 Display, LUA, and Printer LU to allow access to
it only if the LU is assigned to both a user and a workstation (or a set of
users and a set of workstations). Thus only a specific user logged on to a
specific workstation (or a set of users who are logged on to a specific set of
workstations) can access these LUs.

For all other cases, access is denied to the LUs.

To configure the LU for the user-plus-workstation-based security, there is a new
User Workstation Secured check box in the LU property page. This security is
turned off by default.
