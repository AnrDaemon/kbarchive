TITLE   :APPC Security Information Sent Even If Host Doesn't Support It
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server

KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An APPC/CPI-C application that has been used to successfully connect to a host
system (mainframe computer or AS/400) with previous versions of Microsoft SNA
Server may fail when the host system returns an UNBIND message with SNA Server
versions 3.0, SP2, 3.0 SP3, and 4.0.

This problem has been reported by customers using the following programs, but may
occur with other APPC/CPI-C applications.

 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS version 1.0 included
   with SNA Server version 4.0

 - IBM CICS for Windows NT

SNA Server Data Link Control (DLC) message tracing shows that the UNBIND message
received from the host system indicates a session failure (UNBIND Type 0x'FE')
that includes IBM Sense Data 0x'10086040'.

In addition, the following messages may be logged in the Windows NT Application
Event Log on the computer where SNA Server is running:

   Event ID: 90
   Source: SNA APPC Application
   Description: APPC protocol violation:

      Sense data   = 0C001110
      TP_ID        = 0000000080197900
      Conv_ID      = 00792100

   EXPLANATION: A protocol violation was detected on an APPC conversation.
   The TP_ID and Conv_ID in this message were shown on a previous message.
   The conversation failure is reported to the local TP with a return code
   of AP_CONV_FAILURE_NO_RETRY. The SNA sense data provides detail about
   the error type.

   Event ID: 38
   Source: SNA Server
   Description: APPC session deactivated abnormally

      Qualifier      = 0003
      Connection     = <Connection Name>
      LU alias       = <Local LU Alias>
      PLU alias      = <Partner LU Alias>
      Mode name      = <APPC Mode Name>

   <..data omitted...>

   EXPLANATION: An APPC session has been deactivated abnormally. The
   qualifier listed above corresponds to one of the following:

   <..data omitted...>

   0003 The session was deactivated because of a permanent (No retry)
   error, such as a parameter mismatch. Contact the administrator of
   the partner LU's system to determine which parameters are mismatched.

Because Events 90 and 38 may be caused by other problems, these events alone are
not sufficient to indicate whether the specific problem described here is being
encountered.

For additional information about Event 38 messages and their common causes,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q139113 SNA Server Event 38, Qualifier 0004 and 0005 Not Documented

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server APPC library is adding the Access Security Information (User ID
and Password) fields to the FMH-5 Attach message that is being sent to the host
even though the host system indicated that it does not support the inclusion of
these fields in the BIND +RSP that is sent to SNA Server.

Bit 3 of byte 23 of the BIND is used to indicate whether the Access Security
Information fields will be accepted on incoming FMH-5 Attaches. Please refer to
the "IBM SNA Formats Guide" (GA27-3136), Chapter 6 for more details on the
structure of the BIND.


RESOLUTION
==========


SNA Server 3.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
3.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q184307 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 3.0 Service Pack



SNA Server 4.0
--------------

This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for SNA Server
version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP2,
3.0 SP3, and 4.0. This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 3.0 Service
Pack 4.

BIND sent to the host system when the APPC application is started.

Byte 23 (where '0x31' is Byte 00) is the Security Support Indicators and is set
to '0x16' in this example. SNA Server indicates that Access Security Information
will be accepted on incoming FMH-5 Attach messages (Bit 3 of byte 23 = 1).

The host system sends a BIND +RSP back to SNA Server and sets Byte 23 to '0x00'.
The host system indicates that it will not accept Access Security Information
fields on incoming FMH-5 Attach messages by setting Bit 3 of Byte 23 to 0.

SNA Server accepts this BIND +RSP, so the APPC library should not be putting the
Access Security Information in the Attach, even if the APPC/CPI- C application
indicates that these fields should be set. An APPC/CPI-C application can specify
that conversation security requiring a User ID and Password is required by
setting the security parameter in the MC_ALLOCATE verb to AP_PGM.

The FMH-5 Attach message shown here includes the Access Security Information
fields for User ID and Password although they are blank in this example. For
additional information about how to interpret an FMH- 5 Attach message, please

The host system responds to this FMH-5 Attach message with an UNBIND Type '0xFE'
(session failure) message shown here. The UNBIND message can be broken out as
follows:

   32 - UNBIND
   FE - UNBIND Type 'FE': Session Failure
      10086040 - IBM Sense Data

The IBM SNA Formats Guide defines this sense data as follows:

   1008 - Invalid FM Header
   6040 - Invalid Attach Parameter: A parameter in the FMH-5
   Attach command conflicts with the statement of LU capability
   Previously provided in the BIND statement.
