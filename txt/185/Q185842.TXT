TITLE   :XADM: 4.0 Server in 5.5 Site Does Not Function Properly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Setup.exe program in the Server\Support\Exch40\<platform>
folder on the Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 CD-ROM to install an Exchange Server
4.0 computer in an Exchange Server 5.5 site, and then apply Exchange Server 4.0
Service Pack 5 on the Exchange Server 4.0 computer, the server may no longer
function properly. In particular, multiple errors related to the message
transfer agent (MTA) or the directory may occur.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the Exchange Server 4.0 database schema is not updated
before you apply Exchange Server 4.0 Service Pack 5. The Exchange Server
database schema is updated when you apply Exchange Server 4.0 Service Pack 2 or
when you install Exchange Server 4.0a.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

 - Apply Exchange Server 4.0 Service Pack 2 before you apply Exchange Server
   Service Pack 5. For information about how to obtain Service Pack 2, please
   see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152858 XGEN: How to Obtain Exchange Server 4.0 U.S. Service Pack 2

 - Install Exchange Server 4.0 from a network share using the installation files
   from the Exchange Server 4.0a CD-ROM instead of the files from the Exchange
   Server 4.0 CD-ROM. Be sure to replace the 4.0a Setup.exe program on the
   network share with the Setup.exe program in the
   Server\Support\Exch40\<platform> folder on the Exchange Server 5.5
   CD-ROM. After you install Exchange Server 4.0a, reapply Exchange Server 4.0
   Service Pack 5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Installing Exchange Server from an Exchange Server 4.0a CD-ROM is equivalent to
applying Exchange Server 4.0 Service Pack 2 on an existing Exchange Server 4.0
computer.
