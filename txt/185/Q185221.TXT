======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

The Internet Mail Service in Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 allows SMTP inbound
mail to be converted to fixed width font (Courier New, by default) if the "Use
fixed-width font" option is checked on the Internet Mail tab of the IMC
Properties dialogue. However, you can use Registry Editor to specify any
particular font type that you would like to use.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

By specifying the font under the following registry key, you can control the font
displayed in the standard Exchange Client Mail Editor when you read SMTP inbound
mail. Every Language is assigned a code page folder, for example the code page
ID for English is 1252.

For example, to change the font from Courier New to Times New Roman, use the
following steps:

1. Run Regedt32.exe and go to the following registry key:

   \\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Codepage\1252

2. Highlight the value: FixedWidthFont

3. Click the Edit menu, and select String Menu Item.

4. In the String Editor dialog box, change Courier New to Times New Roman.

5. Click OK and close the Registry Editor.
