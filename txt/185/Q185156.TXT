======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you correct a misspelled word in the "Not in Dictionary" box of the
"Spelling and Grammar" dialog box and then click Change, tabs or spaces that
were typed at the beginning of the paragraph may be deleted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this problem from occurring, turn on the "Tabs and backspace set left
indent" option. When you use this option (which is turned on by default), when
you type a tab at the beginning of a paragraph, the tab is converted to a left
paragraph indent. When you check the spelling of your document, the indents are
not deleted.

NOTE: Tabs that are typed at the start of a paragraph before this option is
turned on will not be affected by this option. Any new tabs typed at the start
of a paragraph will be changed to a left paragraph indent.

To turn on the "Tabs and backspace set left indent" option, use the following
steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. On the Edit tab, select the "Tabs and backspace set left indent" check box,
   and then click OK.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct the spelling mistake, use one of the following methods.

Method 1: Use One of the Suggestions
------------------------------------

In the "Spelling and Grammar" dialog box, select one of the words in the
Suggestions box, and then click Change.

Method 2: Make the Spelling Correction in the Document
------------------------------------------------------

With the "Spelling and Grammar" dialog box open, click in your document, correct
the spelling mistake, and then click Resume to continue to check the spelling of
your Word document.
