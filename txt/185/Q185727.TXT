TITLE   :BUG: closesocket() Fails with 10038 After _open_osfhandle()
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbWinNT400sp4fix kbAPI kbSDKPlatform kbWinsock kbGrpDSNet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP3 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP3 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The _open_osfhandle() function allocates a C run-time file handle and sets it to
point to the operating-system file handle. When _open_osfhandle() function is
used on a socket descriptor, both _close() and closesocket() should be called
before exiting. However, on Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3, closesocket() after
_close() returns 10038.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.

This bug is not present in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 1, Service Pack 2, or the
original build of Windows NT 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When _open_osfhandle is used on a socket descriptor, both _close() and
closesocket() should be called before exiting. _close() only closes the file
handle. closesocket() has to be called as well to close the socket descriptor
and clean up the underlying socket object.
