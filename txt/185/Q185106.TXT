TITLE   :XFOR: LinkAge 3.2 Missing Domain Names In Exchange Notes DXA
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use LinkAge 3.2 Directory Exchange Agent (DXA), you may find that
Exchange Server recipient addresses are missing the domain name and other Lotus
Notes address attributes. This creates incorrect or incomplete name mapping from
Exchange Server to Lotus Notes. Thus causing these addresses to be invalid for
Lotus Notes. Moreover, these addresses may not propagate to Lotus Notes.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused because the LinkAge Lotus Notes Proxy generator is not
installed on the same Exchange Server computer(s) from which the names were
imported. The Lotus Notes Proxy generator is responsible for creating the Lotus
Notes address for Exchange Server recipients.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Run Linkage 3.2 setup from the Linkage program group.

2. Choose the "Install Proxy addressing at the downstream Site(s)" option.

3. Choose Notes Proxy Addressing and fill out the Exchange Server name in your
   site or organization.

4. Select Yes to generate Notes Proxy addresses for existing Exchange Server
   users.

5. Send a full reload to the DXA.
