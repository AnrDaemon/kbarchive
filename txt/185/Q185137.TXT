TITLE   :Log Logical Record Request May Be Sent to Wrong Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When running an application on a Windows NT computer with Client Services for
NetWare (CSNW) or Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW) installed, the NetWare API
Log Logical Record may be sent to the wrong server. This could result in either
an error being returned from the server or successful log logical record being
sent to an invalid server.

CAUSE
=====

In CSNW and GSNW, the log request is sent to the client's preferred server, or
to the primary server if a preferred server has not been configured. If neither
of these servers is available at the time of the request, the client software
will try to locate a new server to make the request to. Thus, if the client is
running an application that requests a log logical record against any server
other than the preferred or primary, it may send the request to an invalid
server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
