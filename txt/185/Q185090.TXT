The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article illustrates how you can create multicolored items in a combo box
using Visual FoxPro versions 3.x and 5.x.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create multicolored items in a combo box, the setting of the combo box
RowSourceType has to be 9-popup and the RowSource property has to be set to the
name of the popup.

The following steps illustrate how to accomplish this:

1. Create a form.

2. Place in the following code in the INIT event of the form:

         #DEFINE RedBar ,RGB(150,0,0)
         #DEFINE GreenBar ,RGB(0,150,0)
         #DEFINE BlueBar ,RGB(0,0,255)
         #DEFINE YellowBar ,RGB(255,255,0)

         DEFINE POPUP MultiColor

         DEFINE BAR 1 of MultiColor ;
            Prompt "Red" COLOR RedBar

         DEFINE BAR 2 of MultiColor ;
            Prompt "Green" COLOR GreenBar

         DEFINE BAR 3 of MultiColor ;
            Prompt "Blue" COLOR BlueBar

         DEFINE BAR 4 of MultiColor ;
            Prompt "Yellow" COLOR YellowBar

3. Add a Combo box object to the form and set the following properties:

         RowSourceType = 9 - popup
         RowSource = "MultiColor" (without quote)

4. In the InteractiveChange event of the combo box, place the following code:

         DO CASE
            CASE This.Value = "Red"
               This.Forecolor = RGB(150,0,0)
            CASE This.Value = "Green"
               This.Forecolor = RGB(0,150,0)
            CASE This.Value = "Blue"
               This.Forecolor = RGB(0,0,255)
            CASE This.Value = "Yellow"
               This.Forecolor = RGB(255,255,0)
         ENDCASE

5. Save and run the form.

When the form is run, click the combo box drop-down list. The items in the
drop-down list appear in their respective colors.
