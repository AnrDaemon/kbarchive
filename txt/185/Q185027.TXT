TITLE   :XADM: Event 1282 Logged After Removing TCP/IP From Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If TCP/IP is removed as a network protocol from a computer running Microsoft
Exchange Server 5.0, on which LDAP has been disabled, then the following message
is logged incorrectly as a STOP (RED) event:

   1282/MSExchangeDS/Error/LDAP Interface/Error encountered in getting
   hostname.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server version 5.0. We
are researching this problem and will post additional information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is a harmless message, as TCP/IP has been removed from this computer. It is
incorrectly logged as a STOP event instead of as a WARNING (YELLOW) message.
Furthermore, this message is expected because LDAP functionality requires
TCP/IP.
