SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install a program that uses InstallShield, the setup program may
quit, and you may receive any of the following Dr. Watson error messages:

    - Access Violation in _INS0432._MP

    - Access Violation in _INS0576._MP


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and click Files or Folders.

2. In the Named box, type "uninst.exe" (without quotation marks), type the
   %SystemRoot% drive and folder (usually C:\Winnt) in the Look In box, and then
   click Find Now.

   NOTE: This file should be found in the %SystemRoot% folder.

3. Right-click the Uninst.exe file, and then click Rename.

4. Type "uninst.old" (without quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

5. In the Look In box, click the drive that contains the Service Pack 3 CD-ROM,
   and then click Find Now.

   NOTE: If you do not have the Service Pack 3 CD-ROM, search for Uninst.exe on
   the third-party software media.

6. Right-click the Uninst.exe file, and then click Copy.

7. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Windows NT Explorer.

8. Navigate to the %SystemRoot% folder (usually C:\Winnt), right-click this
   folder, and then click Paste.

9. Quit the Find tool, and then run Setup again.

If the problem still occurs, follow steps 1-9, using "Isuninst.exe" instead of
"Uninst.exe."
