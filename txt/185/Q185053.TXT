SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to print duplex (print on both sides of the paper) on
a Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 5/5M PostScript printer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To print duplex (print on both sides of the paper) on a Hewlett-Packard LaserJet
5/5M PostScript printer, the following conditions must be met:

1. The optional duplex unit must be installed and recognized by the printer.
   Print the self test page to verify that the duplex unit is correctly
   installed.

2. In the Windows NT 4.0 PostScript driver for the HP LaserJet 5/5M, make sure
   that the duplex option is enabled. On the Device Setting tab, click Duplex
   Unit in the Installable Options folder and make sure that the setting is
   Installed.

3. From the application software, select Print Setup on the File file and make
   sure that the Page Setup tab has the option "Print on both sides (duplex
   printing)" set to either "short edge" or "long edge" as preferred.

4. Set the resolution for the print job according to how much printer memory is
   installed. Additional memory is required to print duplex at 600 dpi or on
   larger paper sizes.

The following chart shows how much memory is required for specific paper sizes,
resolutions and optional features when printing to the LaserJet 5/5M in
Postscript mode. Note that less memory is required for PCL mode.
