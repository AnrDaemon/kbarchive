TITLE   :STOP 0x3F Error When SFGW Fails to Create DBCS Folder
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:Windows:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a double-byte character set (DBCS) directory on the AS/400 using
the Shared Folders Gateway (SFGW) Service, the computer may display the
following blue screen STOP error message:

   STOP:0x0000003F (0x00000000, 0x00000010, 0x0000000A, 0x0000522B)
   NO_MORE_SYSTEM_PTES

CAUSE
=====

When the CreateDirectory() call fails, the SFGW Service completes the same I/O
request packet (IRP) twice, which causes the blue screen STOP error to occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

3.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
