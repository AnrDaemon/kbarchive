SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the limitations of the CB feature in Monster Truck
Madness 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The CB feature in Monster Truck Madness 2 is not a full-featured chat utility.
Rather, it is a feature with many limitations.

If you use a 16-bit sound card, performance is poor at best. You can expect long
delays between the time a message is sent and the time it is received. Some
players may receive messages before other players by as much as several minutes.
When you use the CB feature in a game, you may experience freezing and frame
dropping when you talk into the microphone. Initial parts of messages may be
lost, and the sound may be garbled or stuttering.

If you use a 32-bit PCI sound card, performance is improved, but is still limited
by the speed of your modem or network connection.
