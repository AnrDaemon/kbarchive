TITLE   :BUG: ActiveX Control in MDI Child Form Does Not Maintain Focus
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbActiveX kbCtrl kbVBp kbVBp500bug kbVBp600bug kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A multiple document interface (MDI) child form contains an ActiveX control, and
the ActiveX control has the focus. When you leave and return to the MDI child
form, the focus does not return to the ActiveX control.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, add Me.SetFocus to the GotFocus event of all
ActiveX controls in the MDI child form.

For Example:

      Private Sub RichTextBox1_GotFocus()
         Me.SetFocus
      End Sub

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Add a reference to the Microsoft Rich TextBox Control 5.0 by completing the
   following steps:

   a. From the Project menu, click Components to display the Components dialog
      box.

   b. In the Controls tab, check Microsoft Rich Textbox Control 5.0.

   c. Click OK to close the Components dialog box.

3. Add a TextBox and a Rich TextBox control to Form1. Set the MDIChild property
   of Form1 to True.

4. Add an MDI form to the project. From the Project menu, click Add MDI form.
   MDIForm1 is created by default.

5. Add a PictureBox control to the MDI form.

6. On the Run menu, click Start (or press the F5 key) to start the program.

7. Click on the TextBox control, and then click on the PictureBox control.

8. Click anywhere on the MDI child form except in the TextBox. Note that the
   cursor goes to the TextBox.

9. Repeat the same action but use the Rich TextBox control instead.

   RESULTS: The cursor does not return to the Rich TextBox control.

To work around this problem, copy the following code to the code window of
Form1:

      Option Explicit
      Private Sub RichTextBox1_GotFocus()

         Me.SetFocus

      End Sub
