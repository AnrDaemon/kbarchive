PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

One or both of the following may occur when you run Performance Monitor on a
Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0 system:

 - The application event log may show events that indicate that Snaperf.dll
   generated an exception error or returned an invalid result. Note that this
   has been seen only on multi-processor systems.

   -or-

 - The application event log may include a message similar to the following:

   Event ID: 1010
   Source: Perflib
   Description: The Collect Procedure for the "SnaServr" service in DLL
   "...<snaroot>\system\snapeSnaServr" generated an exception or returned
   an invalid status. Performance data returned by counter DLL will be not be
   returned in Perf Data Block. Exception or status code returned is DWORD 0.

CAUSE
=====

The Performance Monitor DLL for SNA Server does not correctly keep track of the
number of sessions that are reporting response time monitor (RTM) data. In
addition, there is a problem combining the per session byte counts into the per
LU reports that are being written to Performance Monitor.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 4.0. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for SNA Server
version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
