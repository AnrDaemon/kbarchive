-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you format the first letter of a paragraph as a large initial (or
"dropped") capital letter, the letter is not aligned correctly to the left of
the paragraph. The large initial letter may appear at the top of the page or in
some other unexpected location away from the paragraph.

NOTE: To create a large initial capital letter, click Drop Cap on the Format
menu.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when you have changed the section vertical alignment in
document to center or justified.

Large initial capital letters are inserted with the use of frames. Frames are not
affected by center or justified vertical alignment.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, change the vertical alignment of the section to
top. To do this, use the following steps:

1. On the File menu, click Page Setup.

2. Click the Layout tab.

3. Change the Vertical Alignment box to Top, and then click OK.
