TITLE   :WD97: Drop Cap Jumps to Previous Column
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows

KEYWORDS:kbdta word97 kbframe

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In a multi-column document, when you insert a "dropped" drop cap at the
beginning of the second or subsequent column, the drop cap jumps to the bottom
of the previous column.

CAUSE
=====

This functionality is by design and occurs when the paragraph starts in the
previous column and wraps to the top of the next column. When you format a drop
cap as "dropped," Word moves the formatted letter to the beginning of the
paragraph.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do one of the following to correctly position a drop cap:

 - Make sure the letter you are formatting as a drop cap is the first letter of
   the paragraph, and that the paragraph starts at the top of the column in the
   previous column.

   NOTE: Make sure the paragraph does not continue from the previous column.

   -or-

 - After you insert the drop cap, drag it to the correct position.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you click Drop Cap on the Format menu, Word formats a letter, word, or
selected text as a large initial, or dropped, capital letter. A "drop cap,"
which is traditionally the first letter in a paragraph, can appear either in the
left margin or dropped from the base line of the first line in the paragraph.
