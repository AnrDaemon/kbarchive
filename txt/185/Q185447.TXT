The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an LUA RUI or SLI application is started while the SnaBase service is not
running, SnaBase will be started automatically. However, if the SnaBase fails to
open a sponsor connection to SNA Server and then fails to initialize, the LUA
application may fail with an access violation in SNADMOD!sepdbubl.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs because the LUA RUI DLL file (Winrui32.dll) does not properly
handle a failure to initialize the underlying Snadmod.dll.

RESOLUTION
==========

--------------

3.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
