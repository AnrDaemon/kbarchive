TITLE   :Logon Scripts Fail to Process When Using Network Client 3.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.0,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

 

MORE INFORMATION
================

For additional information regarding the Microsoft Network Client version 3.0,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   ARTICLE-ID: Q135465
   TITLE : README.TXT: Microsoft Network Client version 3.0

SYMPTOMS
========

Logon scripts fail to run when using a Network Client 3.0 client.

CAUSE
=====

By default, the Microsoft Network Client version 3.0 only logs on to the local
workstation and not the domain. This causes the logon script to fail to process.

RESOLUTION
==========

The client can be configured to be validated by the domain by using one of the
following methods:

 - Edit the System.ini in the Net directory and change the lmlogon= from 0 to 1.
   Add logondomain=<domainname>.

 - Modify the Autoexec.bat or type the following command from the prompt:

   net logon <username> /domain:<domainname>

After logging on to the domain, your logon script will process first, and then
the following message appears:

   The server \\<servername> successfully logged you on as <username>.
   Your privilege level on this domain is <level>.
   The command completed successfully.
