TITLE   :Dbview Fails to Display SNA Server 4.0 Message Database
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Dbview utility from the Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0
CD (by running Dbview.exe from the Docs\Msgdb folder), when you attempt to open
a message database file (either Snamsg.mdb or Comtimsg.mdb), the following error
message appears:

   Sorry, this control has expired. Please obtain a newer version.

CAUSE
=====

The Dbview utility was built with a control that expired in January 1998, which
causes the failure to occur.

WORKAROUND
==========

The Dbview utility will work if the local machine date is set to 1997 or
earlier.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 4.0. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for SNA Server
version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
