TITLE   :BUG: UserConnection Designer and Parameterized Query in Access
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0

SYMPTOMS
========

The UserConnection Designer lists parameterized queries in Microsoft Access as
stored procedures; if you define the query object based on a stored procedure
and select one, on the Parameters tab, every single column is displayed in the
query as a parameter along with the actual parameter(s). Clicking any parameter
results in the following error:

   "Not a valid name for a parameter."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In Control Panel, double-click the 32bit ODBC icon. In the ODBC Data Source
   Administrator dialog box, create a data source name, MyAccessTest, using
   Microsoft Access Driver and pointing to the Microsoft Access sample database
   Nwind.mdb.

2. Start a new project in Visual Basic and choose Standard EXE. Form1 is created
   by default.

3. On the Project menu, click Components, click the Designers tab, and then
   select Microsoft UserConnection.

4. On the Project menu, click Add ActiveX Designer, and then click Microsoft
   UserConnection. This action brings up the UserConnection1 Properties dialog
   box.

5. On the Connection tab, click Use ODBC Datasource, and select the new DSN,
   MyAccessTest.

6. Click OK to save this information, and return to the Designers window.

7. Insert a new query by right-clicking UserConnection1 and choosing Insert
   Query or by clicking the Insert Query toolbar icon. Query1 is created by
   default.

8. From the Source of Query, choose Based on Stored Procedure. Click the
   drop-down combo box; you see the following three queries:

      Employee Sales by Country
      Invoices Filter
      Sales by Year

9. Select any of them, and click the Parameters tab. All of columns in the query
   are listed in the Parameters list box. Clicking any one of them results in
   the following error:

   Not a valid name for a parameter

Additional query words: kbDSupport kbdse kbODBC kbVBp500 kbVBp600 kbVBp
