PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server

KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The CPU Utilization on an SNA Server computer that is running SNA Print Server
may randomly jump to, and remain at, 100 percent until the Print Server service
is stopped.

CAUSE
=====

A variable that has not been initialized can cause Print Server to start trying
to do work for a device which does not exist. This causes the processor to go
into a loop, from which it does not exit until Print Server is stopped.

RESOLUTION
==========

--------------

3.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
