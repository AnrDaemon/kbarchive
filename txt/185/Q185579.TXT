The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to duplicate a mailbox in a site that is a member of a
distribution list which is homed in another site, the following error message
appears after the associated Microsoft Windows NT account has been selected.

   This object has not yet been completely replicated or cannot be changed
   from this connection. Try connecting to a Microsoft Exchange Server
   computer in the same site as this object.

   Microsoft Exchange Directory
   id c1010ac1

When you click OK or Apply, the following error message appears:

   The object "<Mailbox name>" with directory name "<alias>"
   already
   exists. Enter a unique name on the general property page for this mail
   recipient.

Cancel is the only acceptable response to avoid the previous error messages. The
mailbox has already been created. It will function as a normal mailbox but will
not be on the foreign distribution list.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs because one site tries to write to an object in another site
that it does not own. The Microsoft Exchange Administrator program that is
connected to the site where the mailbox is being created cannot modify the
distribution list because it is owned by another site.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem, create the mailboxes and manually add them to the
distribution in the other site.

As an alternative, you can create a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file for the
distribution list and import that file into the other site after the mailboxes
have been created.
