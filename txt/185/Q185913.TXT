TITLE   :SMS: MIF Attribute Case Change May Cause MIF to Be Rejected
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDataLoader smsdataloader

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you change the case of an attribute in a custom MIF, the Dataloader utility
does not process the MIF and places it into the Badmifs subdirectory. You may
see an entry similar to the following in the Datalodr.log file:

      CDefinedGroup::InsertDefinedAttribute - attribute Operational Group
      Index already in AttributeMap
      CGroup::DefineAttributes - couldn't define attribute
      CGroup::DefineGroupAndAttributes - couldn't define attributes for
      SMS|TableName|002
      finished processing current machine.
      ~Cannot process MIF X00000000.MIF, moving it to BADMIFS

CAUSE
=====

Systems Management Server does not allow you to change the case of a column name
after the column name has been created.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem, you can delete the Group Class (Table) using the
Systems Management Server Database Manager (Dbclean.exe), and force the client
to resend the MIF to re-create the table.

NOTE: Deleting any standard Systems Management Server Group Classes using the
Systems Management Server Database Manager is not recommended. Doing so may
require that you restore from a backup or reinstall so that the Group Classes
(Tables) are re-created.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
