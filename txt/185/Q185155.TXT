The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Using directory export, it is possible to extract all connector information from
the directory to a CSV file. This can be useful for analyzing connector
information, because unlike saving the routing information, all option fields
are exposed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A command line export needs to be used to extract the connector information. The
following is an example of the command line:

   Admin /E <export file> /O <option file>

The option file used should look like the following example:

      [export]
      ExportObject=All
      Subcontainers=Yes
      Basepoint=/o=<Your Org Name>/ou=<Our Site Name>/cn=Configuration
      Container=Connections

The Export CSV file can contain any or all of the following connector related
fields in the header:

   Obj-Class
   Delivery-Mechanism
   Directory Name
   Home-MTA
   Home-Server
   Accept messages from
