======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

Reg.exe may display an "Access denied" error when it is used to query the
registry on a remote computer running Windows NT 4.0 Workstation or Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

Confirm the following if this error is encountered:

 - The user account used to query the remote computer has at least Read Access
   to the WINREG key on the remote computer being queried. Use the Permissions
   command on the Security menu of Regedt32.exe to grant the appropriate user or
   group Read Access to the WINREG key located under
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurePipeServers. By
   default, only administrators have access to this key.

 - The user account used to establish the connection to the remote computer has
   either Read Only or Full Control on the registry key being queried. No
   combination of Special Access permissions will allow a remote user to query a
   registry key on a remote computer.


 - You are using version 1.04 or later of Reg.exe. To determine the version
   number of Reg.exe, type

   REG.EXE /?

   at the Windows NT command prompt.
