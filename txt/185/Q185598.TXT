TITLE   :XFOR: RTF Messages Not Displayed Correctly in Lotus Notes Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a Rich Text Format (RTF) message using WordMail, and then send the
message through the Microsoft Exchange Notes Connector to Lotus Notes, the
message may not display correctly when you open it in a Lotus Notes e-mail
client, version 4.5 or 4.6. Specifically, the following symptoms may occur:

 - The message text may be displayed as Times New Roman when you open the
   message in a Lotus Notes client, even though the text in the original message
   is formatted using a different font.

 - If the text in the original message is formatted using any of the following
   effects, the effects are not displayed when you open the message in a Lotus
   Notes client. Unless otherwise noted, the text is displayed without any
   effects or special formatting.

    - All caps

    - Any underline other than single underline

    - Double strikethrough

    - Emboss

    - Engrave

    - Hidden

    - Outline (displayed as italic)

    - Shadow

    - Small caps

    - Subscript

    - Superscript

 - If you insert a bitmap image or a device-independent bitmap (DIB) into the
   original message, the image is not displayed properly when you open the
   message in a Lotus Notes client.

CAUSE
=====

These symptoms can occur when Lotus Notes is unable to convert the RTF message.
When the Exchange Notes Connector is functioning properly, these symptoms are
not caused by a problem in the connector.

WORKAROUND
==========
