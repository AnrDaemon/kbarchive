SUMMARY
=======

If you use ControlWizard to generate an MFC ActiveX control, the registered name
of the control is usually the same as its project name. For instance, if the
control's project name is "BABY," then the ActiveX control is named as "BABY
Control" in the Insert ActiveX Control dialog box of any Visual C++
application.

However, Visual Basic shows the control's module name instead in its Components
dialog box.

This article shows you a way to change the control's registered name and module
name after the control's project has been created.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The registered name may be found from a string resource in the .rc file of the
control's project. The string resource always starts with IDS_XXX where XXX is
the name of the control's project. If the project name is "BABY," then the
following can be found in the string's table of the control's project:

   IDS_BABY               "BABY Control"

Set a new control name to the IDS_XXX string resource and rebuild the control's
project. The control is shown in its new name in the Insert ActiveX Control
dialog box.

The control's module name is defined at the first helpstring in the .odl file of
the control's project file. The following is found from the .odl file of the
BABY's project:

   helpstring("BABY ActiveX Control module")

Set a new module name to the helpstring above and rebuild the control's project.
The control's new module name is shown in Visual Basic's Components dialog box.
