TITLE   :Window Closes After Choosing End Task in Edit Alias Dialog Box
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui mspwsw95 win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Personal Web Server version 4.0 for Windows 95 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you right-click a folder, click Sharing, click the Web Sharing tab, click
Share This Folder, click Cancel, click the question mark (?), click OK or Cancel
(but are unable to do so), press CTRL+ALT+DELETE, click Edit Alias, and then
click End Task twice, open Windows Explorer-type folders (such as Control Panel
or Printers) may also close, you may be unable to save changes to Personal Web
Server settings, and icons on the taskbar may disappear.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you click End Task to close an instance of Windows
Explorer that is not responding. The Web Sharing tab that is available with
Personal Web Server updates Windows Explorer, and if you close an instance of
Windows Explorer that is not responding, all instances of Windows Explorer
windows close before you can save any changes.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, save any changes before you click Edit Alias and
then click End Task.
