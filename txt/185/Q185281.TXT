TITLE   :PRB: OnLButtonDblClk() Not Called in Windows CE
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows CE, versions 1.0, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Message handlers for the WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK, WM_RBUTTONDBLCLK and WM_MBUTTONDBLCLK
messages are not called for a Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) application
running in the Windows CE emulation environment or on a handheld PC (H/PC).

CAUSE
=====

For a window to receive the WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK, WM_RBUTTONDBLCLK, or
WM_MBUTTONDBLCLK messages, the class definition of the window must include the
CS_DBLCLKS style. By default, MFC does not add the CS_DBLCLKS style to the class
definition that it uses for single document interface (SDI) frame windows and
views on the Windows CE platform.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, register a new class that includes the CS_DBLCLKS
style and use this new class when you create the window. You can do this in the
PreCreateWindow() method of the window that handles the double-click messages,
as in the following code:

Sample Code
-----------

      BOOL CtestView::PreCreateWindow(CREATESTRUCT& cs)
      {
         if (CView::PreCreateWindow(cs))
         {
            WNDCLASS wc;
            // Get the class information for the default MFC view class.
            ::GetClassInfo(AfxGetInstanceHandle(),cs.lpszClass,&wc);

            // Register a new class using the attributes of the default
            // view class, and make it the new default class.
            cs.lpszClass = AfxRegisterWndClass(wc.style | CS_DBLCLKS,
               wc.hCursor,wc.hbrBackground,wc.hIcon);
            return TRUE;
         }
         return FALSE;
      }

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
