PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Outlook Web Access client to save an attachment in an e- mail
message, the following error may occur:

   Cannot copy <filename>. Cannot find the specified file. Make sure you
   specify the correct path and filename."

Clicking on the attachment will open it as expected.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem only occurs when you usr Internet Explorer 4.0 or 4.01 on Windows
95. Windows NT does not exhibit the same behavior.

To save an attachment through the OWA client on windows 95, use Internet Explorer
3.02 or another browser, or open the message through a standard Exchange or
Outlook client to save the attachment.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook Web Access,
version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
