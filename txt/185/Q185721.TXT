TITLE   :Faxing from Win95 Prompts for Intervention or Has Blank Status
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:WinNT4.0,4.0a;WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server versions 4.0, 4.0a 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Faxing from a Windows 95 client to a Small Business Server may stall and the
client faxing queue displays a blank status or User Intervention Status Needed.
The fax job never shows up in the server fax queue.

CAUSE
=====

During the Computer Setup Wizard, the user may have been denied permissions to
the fax printer. Even after re-enabling permissions, the problem may still
persist.

RESOLUTION
==========

Enable permissions for the Windows 95 user on the SBS fax printer from the
Manage Faxes icon in the More Tasks tab of the SBS Management Console, and then
restart the client computer so that the permission changes take effect.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because the Windows 95 printing subsystem is different than the Windows NT
printing subsystem, this problem does not occur on Windows NT.

Under normal operation, the Windows 95 client queue will empty when the server
accepts the fax queue. At that time, the server queue is not viewable from the
client, giving the appearance of a successful fax job to the Windows 95 client.
