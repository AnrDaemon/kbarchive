TITLE   :PRB: LostFocus of Textbox Control Has Different Behavior
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual Basic version 4.0, when a TextBox control has focus and a toolbar is
clicked, the LostFocus event of the TextBox is executed. Visual Basic 5.0 and
later does not behave the same way and the LostFocus event is not executed.

RESOLUTION
==========

The toolbar is behaving similar to a menu, which is more appropriate.

Do not use a toolbar, in Visual Basic version 5.0, if you want the LostFocus
event of the TextBox control executed when the toolbar is clicked.

Instead, have a CommandButton control on the form if executing LostFocus is
important to the applications design.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Standard EXE project with 1 form. Add Microsoft Common Controls by
   clicking Components on the Project menu.

2. Place a toolbar on the form.

3. Add a TextBox control to the form and place one button on the toolbar by
   right-clicking the toolbar and clicking Properties.

4. Place a MsgBox command in the textbox LostFocus event:

         MsgBox "LostFocus Event of TextBox Control"

5. While the textbox has focus, click the Toolbar control. Note that Visual
   Basic version 4.0 displays the MsgBox, while Visual Basic version 5.0 does
   not.
