TITLE   :XFOR: Carriage Returns Not Preserved by Notes Connector
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you send a message that contains carriage returns/line feeds from a Lotus
Notes Web client through the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes, the
message is incorrectly formatted when it is received by the Microsoft Exchange
client.

For example, if you compose the following message in the Lotus Notes Web Client:

   One.
   Two.
   Three.
   Four.

The message is received by the Microsoft Exchange client as follows:

   One.Two.Three.Four.

CAUSE
=====

The non-Web based Notes client emits a "/par /pard" in its RTF (Rich Text
Format) exporter to signify an end of paragraph marker (carriage return). The
Web-based client emits only a "/pard" in the RTF exporter to signify the end of
paragraph marker. Therefore, the Notes Connector interprets the RTF output as
containing no end of paragraph markers, resulting in the incorrectly formatted
text.


RESOLUTION
==========

Apply the fix described below. The Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes
has been corrected to explicitly check the RTF output stream for an end of
paragraph marker, followed by text. This ensures that the carriage returns
contained in messages sent from the Lotus Notes Web client will be preserved.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server version 5.5.
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.5. For information about obtaining the Service Pack,
