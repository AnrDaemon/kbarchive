KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Macintosh operating system 8.0 and 8.1 clients cannot copy files from CD-ROMs
shared on computers running both Windows NT Server 4.0 and Services for
Macintosh. When copying files from a CD-ROM, you receive the following error:

   File not found

CAUSE
=====

The Macintosh client is looking for a resource fork on the shared CD-ROM volume
on a Services for Macintosh server, which it does not find and ends the request
with the error message.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0 and
Services for Macintosh version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will
post additional information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
