TITLE   :XADM: Synchronization of OST Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to synchronize all folders from a Microsoft Exchange or Outlook
Client with an OST file, you may encounter the following error message:

   Synchronization with the offline folder file could not be
   completed. Consult the synchronization log in the deleted
   items folder for details.

CAUSE
=====

Messages with zero length Predecessor Change List (PCLs) are getting into the
information store. Messages of this nature cannot be synchronized by OSTs;
therefore, (SYNC_E_IGNORE) is returned.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
