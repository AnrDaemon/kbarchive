MORE INFORMATION
================

Electronic mail (from the Internet) abuse can cause system slow-downs, high
usage of network bandwidth, undesirable usage of hard disk storage, and general
annoyance for users by clogging their client inboxes.

The following terms and abbreviations are often used to describe different kinds
of network abuse:

 - spam (slang): A generic term describing various forms of electronic mail
   abuse. A good general definition is as follows: "Spam is flooding the
   Internet with many copies of the same message, in an attempt to force the
   message on people who would not otherwise choose to receive it."

 - EMP (Excessive Multi-Posting): The same article (or essentially the same
   article) posted an unacceptably high number of times to one or more
   newsgroups. This is seen by NNTP clients and received by the Internet News
   Service.

 - CROSS-POSTING: A single message instance that is posted to multiple news
   groups. This is seen by NNTP clients and is received by the Internet News
   Service. CROSS-POSTING takes up only one message in News Server, but appears
   in more than one place. Cross-posting to relevant newsgroups is usually
   considered appropriate. Cross-posting a message that is not relevant to
   several newsgroups can be considered inappropriate.

 - UBE (Unsolicited Bulk E-mail): E-mail with substantially identical content
   sent to many recipients who did not ask to receive it. This type of mail can
   be seen in Exchange or POP3 clients, and is delivered through the Internet
   Mail Service.

 - UCE (Unsolicited Commercial E-mail): E-mail containing commercial information
   that has been sent to a recipient who did not ask to receive it. Most UBE is
   UCE.

 - MMF (Make Money Fast): Usually chain letters or other mail that claims to be
   able to make the recipient a lot of money. May be fraudulent or scam.

 - MLM (Multi-Level Marketing): A type of MMF scheme that includes sending money
   in the form of an "initial investment" and encourages recruitment of others.
   May be fraudulent or scam.

 - MAILBOMB: Delivering large amounts of e-mail with the sole purpose of
   shutting down the recipients server or client, or to deny others legitimate
   access to the server.
