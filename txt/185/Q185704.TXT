SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use the Floplock service to restrict access to
floppy disk drives on a computer running Windows NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Floplock service can be used to limit floppy disk drive access to only
Administrator Group accounts (Windows NT Server) or Administrator and Power User
Group accounts (Windows NT Workstation). When the Floplock service is installed
and set to start automatically, only users in the appropriate groups have access
to the computer's floppy disk drives.

Installing the Floplock Service
-------------------------------

To use the Floplock service, you must install the service using the Service
Installer (Instsrv.exe) tool included with the Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit
or Microsoft Windows NT Zero Administration Kit (ZAK). You must have
Administrator privileges for the computer on which you are installing the
Floplock service. To install the Floplock service, follow these steps:

1. Install Instsrv.exe and Floplock.exe from the Windows NT Resource Kit or ZAK.
   To do so, refer to the documentation included with the Windows NT Resource
   Kit or ZAK.

2. At a command prompt, type the following commands, pressing ENTER after each
   command

   cd\<folder name>
   instsrv <service name> <drive>:\<folder name>\floplock.exe

   where <service name> is the name you specify for the Floplock service,
   <drive> is the drive letter on which the Windows NT Resource Kit or ZAK
   is installed, and <folder name> is the folder in which the Windows NT
   Resource Kit or ZAK is installed.

   NOTE: <service name> is any name you choose for the Floplock service.
   For more information, please see the Floploc.txt file or the "Instsrv" Help
   topic. The Floplock service must be located on a local hard disk and not on a
   mapped network drive.

Setting the Service Startup Type
--------------------------------

To configure the Floplock service to start automatically when you log on to
Windows NT, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Services.

3. In the list of services, double-click the service name you specified in step
   2, and then click Startup.

4. Click Automatic, click OK, and then click Close.

5. Restart your computer.

Removing the Floplock Service
-----------------------------

To remove the Floplock service, type the following line at a command prompt, and
then press ENTER

instsrv <service name> remove

where <service name> is the name you specify for the Floplock service.

NOTE: You must have Administrator privileges on the computer on which the
Floplock service is installed.

Stopping the Floplock Service
-----------------------------

To temporarily stop the Floplock service, follow these steps:

NOTE: You must have Administrator privileges on the computer on which the
Floplock service is installed.

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Services.

3. In the list of services, click <service name>, where <service
   name> is the name you specify for the Floplock service, and then click
   Stop.

4. When you are prompted to stop the service, click Yes, and then click Close.

If you restart the computer without Administrator privileges and the Floplock
service is set to start automatically, the service is restarted.

The Floplock service is included with the Windows NT Resource Kit and ZAK. For
