 - Use the MAP command at an MS-DOS prompt to display the list of mapped drives
   and their volume names. To do so, type the following command at the MS-DOS
   prompt, and then press ENTER:

   " map " (without the quotation marks)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 95.
