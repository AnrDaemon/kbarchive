SYMPTOMS
========

When you have the Format list in the Modify Style dialog box open (on the Format
menu, click Style, and then click Modify), and you click the Organizer, Apply,
or Cancel button on the inactive Style dialog box, Word quits without giving you
the choice of saving your work.

In Windows 95 and Windows 98, the following error message appears:

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.

   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

When you click Details, Word displays the following message:

   WINWORD caused an invalid page fault in module MSO97.DLL at <address>.

In Windows NT 4.0, the following error message appears:

   An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
   generated.

   Winword.exe

   Exception: access violation (0xc0000005), Address: <address>

WORKAROUND
==========

When you have the Format list box open, make sure that you select an item in the
Modify Style dialog box rather than in the Style dialog box.
