PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you send a message with a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) header
that contains a Content-Type entry that wraps to a second line, the message may
not be displayed correctly when you open it in an e-mail client. The message may
be displayed in plain text instead of the format defined by the Content-Type
entry.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Exchange Server cannot convert messages with MIME headers that contain
Content-Type entries that wrap to a second line. As a result, the messages are
not displayed correctly when you open them in an e-mail client.
