======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can use Systems Management Server to do the following tasks:

 - Package Command Manager (PCM) Install software on selected workstations
   throughout your enterprise.

 - Program Group Control (PGC) Install software on distribution servers, where
   it can be shared by specified workstations .

 - Inventory Perform an inventory or audit of the software installed on
   networked computers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To complete the tasks described above, complete following steps:

1. Create a source directory, share the directory, and copy the installation
   files to it. (Note that this is not applicable for software inventory.)

2. In the Systems Management Server Administrator program, create a package that
   uses the source directory specified in step 1 and contains instructions for
   executing the package on the target clients and support operating systems.

3. In the Systems Management Server Administrator program, create a job
   explaining where to send the package. Note that this step is not necessary
   for inventory packages.

Systems Management Server compresses a package before sending it to the target
site, thus reducing the amount of traffic on the network as the package is
passed through the site hierarchy.

When the target site server receives the package, it places the package on one or
more distribution servers, and places the installation, sharing, or inventory
instructions for the target computers on the appropriate logon servers.

The three steps above are common for all types of packages. However, depending on
the defined package properties, Systems Management Server handles each package
differently. Systems Management Server uses the following properties to define
packages:

 - Workstation properties are used to install a package on the clients (Run
   Command On Workstation jobs).

 - Sharing properties are used to install a package on each of the servers and
   then share it from those servers (Share Package On Server jobs).

 - Inventory properties are used to maintain inventory on a package.

You can define any (or all) of these properties for any package. You can also add
or modify properties after the package has been created.

Systems Management Server includes package definition files (PDFs) and
configuration scripts for many popular Microsoft applications and operating
systems. If you are creating a package to distribute a Microsoft application,
you can use a PDF to define many package properties for you.
