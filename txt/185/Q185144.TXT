SYMPTOMS
========

In Word 97 for Windows, when you open a document created in another version of
Word, numbered lists with multiple levels are converted incorrectly.

Only the first item in the list remains numbered. For example, if the list looks
like the following:

   1. Dog
      a. Shepherd
      b. Collie
   2. Cat
      a. Tabby
      b. Persian

When opened in Word 97, the list is converted to the following:

   1. Dog
         Shepherd
         Collie
      Cat
         Tabby
         Persian

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the numbered list is inside a table.

WORKAROUND
==========

Create the numbered list outside of a table for correct conversion.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This problem has been corrected in Word 2000.

Additional query words: multilist multiple tiered sublist alphabetical alphabetic ordering ordered
