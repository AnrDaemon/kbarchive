TITLE   :SMSINST: %SystemRoot% Values Not Written to Registry Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:smsinst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Windows NT environment variables (such as %SystemRoot%) are added to the
registry during a repackage, they are captured by a repackage process, but the
resulting script does not write the correct value(s) to the registry on the
client during the Systems Management Server Installer installation routine.

CAUSE
=====

Systems Management Server Installer uses the syntax %VARIABLENAME% to denote
internal script variable values. For example, if the Installer variable USER is
set to a value of 'John Smith', using the %USER% syntax would cause 'John Smith'
to be substituted wherever %USER% appeared.

Windows NT utilizes the same syntax to denote the value of environment variables.
When the Systems Management Server Installer run-time encounters the value
%SystemRoot% in an Edit Registry script item, it interprets this as the
Installer variable value for %SystemRoot%, rather than the Windows NT
environment variable value. Usually the Installer does not have a specific value
defined for this, so nothing is actually written to the registry.

WORKAROUND
==========

Using %SystemRoot% as an example, you would change the string %SystemRoot% to
%%SystemRoot%% wherever it exists in the Installer script. This causes the
literal value %SystemRoot% to be written to the system, which allows the
environment variable to be resolved correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server Installer version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
