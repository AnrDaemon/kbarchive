TITLE   :SMS: Disabling the Mandatory Countdown Timer in PCM
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbPCM smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The client component Package Command Manager (PCM) in Microsoft Systems
Management Server version 1.2 has a built-in timer that initiates a countdown of
5 minutes when a job's mandatory time has been reached. A new version of Package
Command Manager is available for Systems Management Server 1.2 which allows the
standard 5 minute mandatory countdown timer to be disabled on a per-client
basis.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

To disable the 5 minute timer for mandatory Package Command Manager packages,
apply the updated version of Pcmwin16.exe or Pcmwin32.exe to each affected
client, and then place the following entry in the [Local] section of the Sms.ini
file on the Systems Management Server on each client:

      DisablePCMCountdown=TRUE

This resets the timer from 5 minutes to 0 minutes, which effectively disables
it.

NOTE: This change must be made on a per-client basis, and will not work without
the new PCM executable.

A Systems Management Server Installer package can be created and distributed to
implement this Sms.ini change to the required clients.
