TITLE   :SNA Server Manager Not Reflecting Correct Status
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::3.0 SP2,3.0 SP3,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When remotely viewing the status of an SNA Server computer, SNA Manager may
display a blank status column for a particular connection or print server.

CAUSE
=====

When sending updates to the MngClient, the MngAgent hits a boundary condition,
and the DMOD (part of the client server interface) terminates the connection
between the Manage Client and the Manage Agent. After that occurs, the status no
longer appears. This problem can be reproduced on a connection that has 254 LUs,
each of which has an 8-character name. However, there may be other cases that
hit this boundary condition.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 3.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
3.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q184307 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 3.0 Service Pack



SNA Server 4.0
--------------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 4.0. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for SNA Server
version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, stop and restart the MngAgent service on the server
that is not showing a status. The status will usually disappear again within a
few days.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 SP2 and
3.0 SP3 and SNA Server 4.0. This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 3.0
Service Pack 4.
