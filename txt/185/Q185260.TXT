TITLE   :User Accounts May Get Locked out After Entering Wrong Password
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



SYMPTOMS
========

When using Remote Access Service (RAS) with third-party dial-in servers using
Shiva Password Authentication Protocol (SPAP), a user account may be locked out
if a wrong password is entered. This problem will only occur if account lockout
is enabled.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if Windows NT has to retry the authentication request.
Windows NT loses synchronization with the server. This causes Windows NT to
retry the authentication requests until retries are exhausted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
