MORE INFORMATION
================

The video corruption is caused by the use of an invalid paintbrush handle. After
the video corruption occurs and usage continues, the application will trap with
a 0x0000021a error. The video corruption will show itself as a failure to scroll
the entire image. The system becomes unstable at this point and other graphical
problems arise such as the mouse pointer turning black or using some system icon
for is image.


SYMPTOMS
========

You may notice a display scrolling problem with Intergraph's Microstation
running on Windows NT 4.0 with multiple processors. The monitor will show only
part of the display during scrolling and will be corrupted by other bitmaps such
as other system bitmaps. When this occurs and you continue to use the
application, you will receive the following stop error:

   STOP: 0x0000021a

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
