Access Hidden Track
-------------------

Monster Truck Madness 2 contains a hidden track called the Torture Pit. This
track is similar to the Arena Rumble track except that it contains dirt mounds
and obstacles where the Arena Rumble track contains a wrestling ring.

To access the Torture Pit track, follow these steps:

1. Start a race at Sidewinder Canyon.

2. Drive until you reach checkpoint four.

3. Continue around the corner and across the bridge.

4. When you reach the far side of the bridge, you see a set of barricades on the
   right side of the road. Drive through these barricades and down the road.

5. Turn right when you reach the bridge. Drive across the bridge and under the
   archway.

6. When you receive a message prompting you to restart the game to see the
   secret track, do so.

You can also gain access to the hidden Torture Pit track by editing the
Monster.ini file. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open the Monster.ini file in Notepad.

2. Locate the Showhiddentrack=0 entry in the [Game] section.

3. Modify the Showhiddentrack=0 entry so it matches the following line:

   Showhiddentrack=666

4. Quit Notepad. When you are prompted to save the changes, click Yes.

5. Restart Monster Truck Madness 2.

Access Instant Brakes
---------------------

When you go over a cliff or need to stop the truck immediately, press H twice in
rapid succession. This code calls the helicopter to stop the truck and cancels
the call to continue racing.
