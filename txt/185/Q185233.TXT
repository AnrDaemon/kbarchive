 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to set the color transparency of a selected picture in the
document's header or footer (click Set Transparent Color on the Picture
toolbar), positioning your mouse pointer over the picture causes Word to stop
responding, and the following error message appears:

In Windows 95 and Windows 98
----------------------------

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.

   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

When you click Details, Word displays the following message:

   WINWORD caused an invalid page fault in module MSO97.DLL at <address>.

In Windows NT 4.0
-----------------

   An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
   generated.

   Winword.exe

   Exception: access violation (0xc0000005), Address: <address>

   -or-

   The instruction at "<address>" referenced memory at "0x00000000".

   The memory could not be "read".

CAUSE
=====

This error message appears if you inserted the picture with the "Float over
text" option selected.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.

Method 1: Clear the "Float over Text" Check Box
-----------------------------------------------

Before setting the transparent color for the picture, clear the "Float over text"
check box. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click to select the inserted picture.

2. On the Format menu, click Picture.

3. On the Position tab, click to clear the "Float over text" check box and click
   OK.

Method 2: Set Color Transparency Prior to Inserting Picture
-----------------------------------------------------------

Set the transparent color prior to inserting the picture into the header or
footer. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Insert your picture into the main body of your document.

2. Click to select your picture.

3. If the Picture toolbar is not visible, on the View menu, point to Toolbars,
   and then click Picture.

4. On the Picture toolbar, click Set Transparent Color.

5. On your picture, click the color that you want to make transparent.

6. While the picture is selected, click Cut on the Edit menu.

7. On the View menu, click Header And Footer.

   and then click Paste on the Edit menu.
