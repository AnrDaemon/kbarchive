TITLE   :Outwars: Background Music Echoes or Sounds Distorted
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbsound kbimu msgame kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outwars, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you play Microsoft Outwars, the music in the game may echo or sound
distorted, as if two tunes are being played at the same time. In addition, if
you attempt to play CD audio tracks directly from the Outwars compact disc using
Media Player, the playback may not be audible.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if your CD-ROM drive is not properly connected to your
sound card.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, connect your CD-ROM drive to your sound card using a CD
audio cable.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The interactive music system used by Outwars combines CD audio and wave audio to
dynamically match the background music to the action in the game. If CD audio is
not routed through the sound card, the interactive music system may not function
properly.

If multiple CD-ROM drives are installed in the computer, you must use CD audio
cables to connect each CD-ROM drive to the sound card.
