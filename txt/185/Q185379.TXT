TITLE   :Browser Stops When .Exe File Attempts to Run Instead of Download
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Browser Symptoms
----------------

When you click an .exe file from a browser to download it, the file attempts to
run, causing the browser to stop responding.

NOTE: Internet Explorer does not actually stop responding. After the timeout
period eventually expires, it displays the following error message:

   Internet Explorer cannot open the Internet site
   http://<URL>/<filename>.exe.

   The operation timed out

Server Symptoms
---------------

In the Event Viewer on the computer running Internet Information Server (IIS),
the following error is listed in the event log:

   System Error, Source=W3SVC, Event ID=16

The event details contains the description:

   The script started from the URL '/<filename>.exe' with parameters ''
   has not responded within the configured timeout period. The HTTP server is
   terminating the script.

CAUSE
=====

The virtual directory containing the .exe file has the Execute application
permission enabled. This causes IIS to attempt to run the .exe files in that
virtual directory for the browser instead of downloading them.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the virtual directory application permission
to None or Script. To do this, perform the following steps:

1. In Internet Service Manager (ISM), view the Properties page for the
   appropriate virtual directory in the Web site.

2. On the Directory, Home Directory, or Virtual Directory tab, under
   Permissions, select either None or Script.
