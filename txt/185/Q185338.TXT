TITLE   :SMS: PCM as a Service and Security Context
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms120 kbsms120bug kbPCM

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Package Command Manager (PCM) as a service, the registry key
HKEY_CURRENT_USER, is not updated under the context of the profile of the user
who is logged on.

CAUSE
=====

The HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry key is updated in the context of the account that
is making the changes. Thus when you use PCM as a service, the context is that
of the Systems Management Server or PCM Service account.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can mount the user's hive with Reg.exe and then place the keys into the
User's context.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
