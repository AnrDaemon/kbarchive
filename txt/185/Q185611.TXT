TITLE   :WD97: Track Changes Tracks Only the Last Change Made to Text
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The ScreenTip that displays information about tracked changes (the box that
appears while the mouse pointer rests) only shows information about the last
change made to the text.

For example, if one person adds a word to a document while "Track changes while
editing" is turned on, the ScreenTip for that text will display that persons
name, the type of change made, and the date and time of the change. If another
person then deletes the text, the ScreenTip will display information about the
deletion.

CAUSE
=====

The Track Changes feature only tracks the last change made to each piece of text
in a document.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use versioning to track multiple changes to the same text. To do this, click
Versions on the File menu.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design of Microsoft Word.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Versioning lets you maintain a working history of a document. With this feature
you can see exactly who did what on a document and when. You can also enter
descriptive text about the changes made in each version. All the versioning
information is stored within the document, so you don't need to maintain and
track multiple copies of the document. In addition, you can have Word
automatically save a version at the end of every session, so you can see who
changed what in each version.

Additional query words: revise revisions
