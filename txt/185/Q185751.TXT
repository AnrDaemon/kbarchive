KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

 

SYMPTOMS
========

The following message may appear when installing an Intel EtherExpress Pro 100B
Ethernet adapter (or other PCI cards) into a system running Microsoft Windows NT
version 3.51 or 4.0:

   The system has not enabled IO address mapping for the device you have
   installed. Please try moving the adapter to another PCI slot or update
   the system BIOS.

CAUSE
=====

This problem has been shown to occur on computers with a Phoenix BIOS when the
"Plug and Play OS" BIOS setting is set to Yes.


If the BIOS setting is changed to Yes after the driver has been installed and was
working correctly, the following error message will appear in the system log and
functionality will cease:

   Event 5003
   E100B1: Could not find an adapter

Many computers are loaded with Microsoft Windows 95 from the manufacturer and
this setting of Yes is correct for that operating system. Users who subsequently
want to load Windows NT but who fail to change the setting may encounter this
error.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, change the BIOS setting to No.
