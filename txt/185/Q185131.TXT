TITLE   :XADM: Dynamic Link Library Edb.dll Could Not Be Found
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start the Information Store service after a server crash, the
following error message appears:

"The dynamic link library edb.dll could not be found in the specified path
<PATH system variable>"

CAUSE
=====

Some Exchange files may have been corrupted during the server crash. When the
Information Store service is started, it thinks it is dealing with the EDB
format rather than the ESE97 format.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, reinstall Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 by running
Setup.exe from the Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 CD and selecting Reinstall.
