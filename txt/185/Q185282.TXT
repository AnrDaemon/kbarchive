SYMPTOMS
========

You can experience two problems when you choose compound file support for an MFC
application based on CRichEditView. The first problem also occurs with MFC
applications based on other view classes (eg. CView, CEditView, and so on):

1. The document's Serialize function will pass in what seems to be an invalid
   CArchive object. For example, if you place the following code in the
   Serialize function of an application that includes compound file support,
   nothing will appear in the message box:

         CFile *pFile = ar.GetFile();
         AfxMessageBox(pFile->GetFilePath());

2. When you save your document to a file, Word or WordPad will not be able to
   correctly read it.

These problems can arise when you use the AppWizard to create single document
interface (SDI) or multiple document interface (MDI) applications, and when you
enable compound file support (in Step 3 of the AppWizard). Typically, you see a
call to EnableCompoundFile() in the constructor of your CDocument-derived class
when this problem occurs.

CAUSE
=====

1. The CArchive object passed in by the document's Serialize function is fine.
   The m_strFileName (file name) member of CArchive is empty because the
   compound file support is enabled in the application. The CArchive object is
   associated with a COleStreamFile object, which is a wrapper for a stream
   object (it supports the IStream interface). This stream object represents
   only a part of the compound file, and so the file name field is empty.

2. When you enable compound files in a CrichEditView-based application, the Rich
   Text Format (RTF) stream provided is stored in a compound file layout, which
   neither Word nor WordPad understands. When you try to display a compound file
   with either Word or Wordpad, the files display as plain text.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. If you want to use compound files, your code must not try to get information
   that isn't defined for a compound file from the CArchive object.

2. If you want your files to be compatible with Word and WordPad, don't choose
   compound file support. Word and WordPad can understand the RTF stream stored
   in a flat file.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To reproduce the perceived problem of an invalid CArchive object, perform the
following steps:

1. Use the MFC AppWizard (exe) to generate an SDI or MDI application with all
   the defaults, except in Step 3.

   In Step 3, select any of the following options: Container, Mini-server,
   Full-server, or Both container and server. Then select "Yes" in response to
   "Would you like support for compound files?".

2. Finish AppWizard, and put a break point at the beginning of the document's
   Serialize function.

3. Build a debug version. Run the application, and save a file.

4. At the breakpoint, do a QuickWatch of the ar (CArchive) object. Notice that
   ar.m_strFileName is empty. The same thing occurs when opening a file.
