PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdisplay kberrmsg kbimu msgame bball3dkbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Baseball 3D, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start Microsoft Baseball 3D, you may receive an error
message stating that you do not have a 3D display adapter that can support the
3D features in the game.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you are using a Diamond Stealth 3D video adapter with
version 4.02.012 of the Diamond Stealth 3D video driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, install the Diamond Stealth 3D video driver included on
the Baseball 3D CD-ROM. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Insert the Baseball 3D CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive. Press and hold down the
   SHIFT key when you insert the CD-ROM to prevent Baseball 3D from starting
   automatically.

2. Click Start, and then click Run.

3. In the Open box, type the following line, and then click OK

   <cd-rom>:\drivers\diamond\siis220\sii95104.exe

   where <cd-rom> is the drive letter for the CD-ROM drive.

4. Follow the instructions on the screen to install the updated Diamond Stealth
   3D video driver.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Baseball 3D, version
1.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Baseball 3D does not detect 3D functionality in the Diamond Stealth 3D video
adapter if version 4.02.012 of the retail driver is installed because Baseball
3D checks for 3D features that this version of the video driver does not
support.

In addition, Baseball 3D does not prompt you to update the Diamond Stealth 3D
video driver to the version included on the Baseball 3D CD-ROM.
