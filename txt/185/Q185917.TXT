KEYWORDS:kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The option to install Systems Management Server Remote Control on clients on a
site-wide basis can be configured by using the Site Properties in the Systems
Management Server Administrator program.

In environments where customers do not want to use the Systems Management Server
Remote Control software, the option for installing it can be canceled by
clearing the check box.

However, after applying Systems Management Server Service Pack 3 (SP3), the
Remote Control client software will be installed on all Windows NT clients, even
if the option is not selected in the site's properties.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining the service
