TITLE   :PRB: Visible Property of Container Ignored by ActiveX Controls
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnokeyword

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual FoxPro 3.x and 5.x, when a parent container control has a child
ActiveX control added to it, changing the Visible property of the parent
container control to .F. does not hide the child ActiveX control.

RESOLUTION
==========

The workaround is to explicitly set the Visible property of the ActiveX control
to (.F.).

Replace the sample code in the Click event of the command button with the
following code:

      IF Thisform.command1.caption = "Hide Container"
         Thisform.container1.visible = .F.
         Thisform.container1.olecontrol1.visible = .F.
         Thisform.command1.caption = "Show Container"
      ELSE
         Thisform.container1.visible = .T.
         Thisform.container1.olecontrol1.visible = .T.
         Thisform.command1.caption = "Hide Container"
      ENDIF

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This only happens if the child control is an ActiveX control. Using the FoxPro
base controls works as expected.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form.

2. Add a container control to the form, and name it container1.

3. Add a command button to the form and change the following property:

         Caption = "Hide Container"

4. In the Click event of the command button, place the following code:

         IF Thisform.command1.caption = "Hide Container"
            Thisform.container1.visible = .F.
            Thisform.command1.caption = "Show Container"
         ELSE
            Thisform.container1.visible = .T.
            Thisform.command1.caption = "Hide Container"
         ENDIF

5. Right-click the container and select Edit.

6. Add a text box control and an ActiveX control (a Calendar control) as child
   objects to the container. Name the ActiveX control olecontrol1 and the text
   box control text1.

7. Save and run the form.

   Click the Hide Container button and the container and the text box disappear.
   However, the child ActiveX control within the container remains visible.
