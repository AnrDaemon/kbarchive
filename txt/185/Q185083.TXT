TITLE   :PRB: Combo Box Displays Incorrectly w/ Large DisplayCount
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnokeyword

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you have a large value set in the DisplayCount property of a combo box, the
drop-down of the combo box either does not display or displays incorrectly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use a smaller DisplayCount value.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form.

2. Create a custom array property, something like myarr[1].

3. In the INIT event of the form, place the following code:

         DIMENSION Thisform.myarr[1000]

         FOR i = 1 TO 500
            Thisform.myarr[i] = STR(i)
         ENDFOR

4. Place a combo box object on the form.

5. Set the RowSourceType to 5-Array and the RowSource to Thisform.myarr.

6. Set the DisplayCount to 150.

7. Save and run the form.

8. Click the drop-down array.

   Nothing shows up. Change the DisplayCount to a smaller number like 50 to fix
   this problem.

NOTE: If you change the DisplayCount property to 80 or higher, depending upon
where you have your combo box in the form and the size of the Visual FoxPro
desktop, you may see that the drop-down gets detached from the combo box.
