TITLE   :Shared Printers Are Unavailable After a Server Restart
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you restart your computer running Windows NT, printer shares on your
computer may no longer be available to other users. The Event log may contain
the following event:

   Event ID: 19
   Source: Print
   Type: Error
   Category: None
   Description: Sharing printer failed, <printer name>\<print share name>.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the comment field for a shared printer contains more
than 256 characters, including 2 characters for each new line.

Note that when you initially set up a shared printer with more than 256
characters in the comment field, one of the following messages may be
generated:

 - Printer settings could not be saved. The RPC server is unavailable.

 - Printer settings could not be saved. The data area passed to a system call is
   too small.

 - Printer settings could not be saved. The parameter is incorrect.


RESOLUTION
==========

To allow the system to properly share a logical printer, make sure that the
printer Comment field does not have more than 256 characters total. As a test,
you may want to copy the entire comment field into notepad and save the text as
a file. Check the size (in bytes) of the file to determine whether you have
exceeded the 256 character limit.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0
