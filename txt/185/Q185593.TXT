TITLE   :XFOR: Blank Firstname, Lastname Fields with cc:Mail Dirsync
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The cc:Mail custom recipients created by the cc:Mail directory synchronization
process do not have a First Name or Last Name field.

CAUSE
=====

The cc:Mail directory lists users as "First Last" and not "Last, First". The
directory synchronization process depends on the comma separating the last name
from the first name. Because there is no comma, directory synchronization does
not assign anything to the First Name or Last Name fields in the Exchange
directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the following fix or wait for the next Microsoft
Exchange Server service pack.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
