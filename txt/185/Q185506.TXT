The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a document that was created in an earlier version of Word,
numbered lists may not appear the way you expect them to. If the numbered list
in the original document contains a framed object, the line on which the framed
object appears will be renumbered to one, as in the following example. If the
original list looks like this

  1. Cat
  2. Dog
  3. <Framed Object>
  4. Bird

it will be converted to resemble this when you open it in Word 97:

  1. Cat
  2. Dog
  1. <Framed Object>
  2. Bird

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
