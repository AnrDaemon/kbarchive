PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp500 kbVBp600 kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When compiling an ActiveX DLL or ActiveX EXE using Binary Compatibility, the
following error message might occur:

In Visual Basic 5.0:

   <property name> in the <class name> class module has a procedure
   ID that differs from a similar declaration in the version-compatible
   component.

In Visual Basic 6.0:

   The <Property Name> member was found in the <Class Name> class
   module of the version-compatible component, but not in the current project.

This problem occurs even if you have not modified any interface within the
ActiveX Server.

CAUSE
=====

When descriptions are added to a Let property declared as Friend and having a
corresponding Public Get property, the above error message might occur during
compilation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Open the code window for that class module. Then from the Tools menu, select
Procedure Attributes. Then find the property name in the Name drop-down list box
and delete any text in the description box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using the Visual Basic Class Builder Utility Add-In, you have the option of
adding "Descriptions" to properties of the ActiveX Server object that is being
developed. These descriptions are useful in tools such as the Object Browser,
when other programmers are using the ActiveX Servers in their projects.

After the Visual Basic Class Builder Utility builds the class, it is common to
modify the function stubs generated to suit the purpose of the class. When
descriptions are added to a Let property declared as "Friend" and having a
corresponding "Public" Get property, the above error message might occur during
compilation.
