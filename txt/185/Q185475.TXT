TITLE   :XADM: LDAP Search Returns No Entries For Hidden/Deleted Objects
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Using LDAP with Simple Authentication and appending cn=Admin to the username
does not return hidden or deleted objects.

The use of cn=Admin is discussed briefly in the Microsoft Development Network
(MSDN) documentation in the following white paper:

"Active Directory Service Interfaces in the Microsoft Exchange 5.5 Environment"

CAUSE
=====

During an attempt by the Microsoft Exchange Server directory Service to
determine whether the user who is logged on has View Only Admin rights (or
greater), a Windows NT system call fails, which causes the user to be denied the
right to view hidden and deleted objects.

The system service attempts to access a thread token, and the Discretionary
Access Control List (DACL) on the impersonated thread may vary based on the type
of impersonation. (For instance, whether ImpersonateLoggedOnUser() or
ImpersonateNamedPipeClient() was called.)

For basic authentication (required in order to pass the cn=Admin argument), the
thread token was inaccessible to the impersonated client.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, make the Exchange Server Service account a member
of the Local Administrators group.
