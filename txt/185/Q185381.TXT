SUMMARY
=======

If you create a new Web site in Microsoft Management Console, Web site operators
cannot remotely connect to that site with Internet Service Manager (HTML) until
you create a virtual directory called IISADMIN. (Note that users designated as
Administrators are able to remotely administer the site through the
Administrative Web Site without this virtual directory.) If you create the Web
site by using Internet Service Manager (HTML), then your Web server
automatically creates the IISADMIN site, because the server assumes that you
want to remotely administer that site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create the IISADMIN virtual directory, do the following:

1. In Internet Service Manager, select the Web site you want your operators to
   remotely administer.

2. Right-click, select New, and then click Virtual Directory.

3. In the Alias box, type IISADMIN and then click Next.

4. Type the following:

   " <DriveLetter>:\Winnt\System32\Inetsrv\Iisadmin " (without the
   quotation marks)

   Replace DriveLetter with the letter of your local drive. This physical path is
   the same as the path for the default Web site's Iisadmin directory. Click
   Next.

5. Select Allow Read Access and Allow Script Access. Click Next.

6. Click Finish.

7. Select the new IISADMIN virtual directory for the Web site, and open its
   property sheets.

8. Select Directory Security property sheet. Under Anonymous Access and
   Authentication Control, click Edit.

9. Clear the Allow Anonymous Access check box.

10. Select either Basic Authentication or Windows NT Challenge/Response
   Authentication, and click OK.
