TITLE   :Date of File Copied to a Windows NT Server and Back Is Changed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::3.11

KEYWORDS:kbenv kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS, version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you copy a file from a computer running Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS to a
Windows NT server and then back again, the file date may be changed.

For example, if you copy a file with a date of 01-01-98 to a Windows NT server,
the date is changed to 13-01-97 when you copy the file back to the computer
running Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if both of the following conditions exist:

 - You copy a file created on January 1 of any non-leap year.

 - You are using the basic redirector included with Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

 - Use the full redirector included with Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS. To do so,
   type "net start full" (without the quotation marks) at a command prompt, and
   then press ENTER.

 - Copy the file to the Windows NT server using the XCOPY command instead of the
   COPY command.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The file date is always changed to 13-01-<nn>, where <nn> is one
year less than the year of the file you originally copied to the Windows NT
server.
