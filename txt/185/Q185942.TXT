TITLE   :XADM: Cannot Run ISINTEG -PATCH on Cluster Server Computer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you run the Microsoft Exchange Information Store Integrity Checker
(Isinteg.exe) with the -PATCH option on an Exchange Server computer on which
Microsoft Cluster Server is installed, you may be unable to start the
information store. When you attempt to do so, you may receive an error message
indicating that the information store and directory databases are inconsistent
and that you need to run the ISINTEG -PATCH command again.

Note that this problem occurs even when you properly set the
_CLUSTER_NETWORK_NAME_ environment variable before you run Isinteg.exe with the
-PATCH option.

CAUSE
=====

When you run Isinteg.exe with the -PATCH option, it modifies the base GUID
(generated unique ID or globally unique identifier) used by the information
store, but it does not notify Microsoft Cluster Server that the change has taken
place. This causes Microsoft Cluster Server to overwrite the new base GUID,
because it thinks the GUID is invalid.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

For additional information about setting the _CLUSTER_NETWORK_NAME_ environment
variable before you run Isinteg.exe with the -PATCH option, please see the
