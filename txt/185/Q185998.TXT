SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Systems Management Server is a Microsoft BackOffice product that
provides a comprehensive solution for centralized management of computers in an
enterprise network. It is a key component of the Microsoft solution for
enterprise distributed systems management. Extending the capabilities built into
Windows NT, Systems Management Server provides network administrators with a
flexible method to centrally manage software and hardware on their corporate
networks. Systems Management Server is an integrated system that provides these
services:

 - Hardware and software inventory

 - Software distribution and installation

 - Managing shared network applications

 - Remote control and troubleshooting

 - Network protocol analysis

Systems Management Server allows an administrator at a central location to
perform these key management functions for client computers. This removes the
need to physically touch a computer for inventory census, software
installations, or problem diagnosis. Systems Management Server works within
existing network environments to provide a complete resource management
solution.
