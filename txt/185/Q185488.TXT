-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Service Pack 3 on a computer running Windows NT 4.0,
Hewlett-Packard (HP) printers may function erratically. They may start printing
multiple copies of jobs, multiple or duplicate separator pages, or print
separator pages even though none are selected.

CAUSE
=====

SP3 overwrites the Hprasddui.dll and Hprasdd.dll files installed with HP
drivers.

RESOLUTION
==========

Reinstall the latest version of the Hewlett Packard printer driver to ensure
that the Hprasddui.dll and Hprasdd.dll files are replaced.
