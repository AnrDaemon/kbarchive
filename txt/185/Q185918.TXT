SUMMARY
=======

The Windows NT Event to Trap Translator (in Systems Management Server) uses the
Windows NT Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) agent to facilitate the
task of forwarding Windows NT Events by means of SNMP to a Systems Management
Server Site Server or other SNMP Management Console.

If you add the SNMP service after applying Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3, you may
receive the following error:

   SNMP.EXE Entry Point Not Found
   The procedure entry point SnmpSvcGetEnterpriseOID could not be
   located in the dynamic link library snmpapi.dll

To eliminate the error, reapply Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3.
