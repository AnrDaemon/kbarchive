TITLE   :XFOR: MSExchangeDX Fails To Start With Missing Xdir.edb File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Directory Synchronization service (DXA) may fail to start
with the following error:

   Error 2140: An Internal Windows NT error occurred

This error will be displayed when you attempt to manually start the (DXA) service
using the Control Panel's services icon.

You may also see the following event in the Application event log:

   Event 124
   Source: ESE97
   Category: Logging/Recovery
   Desc: MSExchangeDX 185 (Unable to read the log header. error - 1022)

The only other events with the source of MSExchangeDX are the startup and
shutdown confirmations.

CAUSE
=====

The transaction log files (Edb.log) are present but the Xdir.edb file is missing
from the Exchsrvr\Dxadata directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

Restore Xdir.edb from backup, or remove all files in the Exchsrvr\Dxadata
directory. Removing the files will cause them to be recreated empty. This
results in the loss of any uncommitted Directory Synchronization transactions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Edb.log contains the path to Xdir.edb. When the Microsoft Exchange Server
Directory Synchronization is started, the Exchange database is initialized. The
Edb.chk file is checked to find out which transactions have been committed from
the Edb.log file to the Xdir.edb file.

If Xdir.edb is not present, the MSExchangeDX service will stop and report the
above errors.
