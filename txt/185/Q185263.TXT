OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbservicepack kbnokeyword kbvfp500 kbvfp500a kbvfp600 kbVS600sp2 kbVS600SP1 kbVS600sp3f

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Issuing a KEYBOARD "{PAUSE KEY}" command in a program or in the Command window
causes Visual FoxPro 5.x to hang.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information
about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q194022 INFO: Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, What, Where, Why

   Q194295 HOWTO: Tell That Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs Are Installed

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior does not occur in Visual FoxPro 3.x.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run Visual FoxPro.

2. From the Command window, issue the following command:

   KEYBOARD "{PAUSE KEY}"

   NOTE: Once the ENTER key is pressed, Visual FoxPro loses its cursor in the
   Command window and none of the menu options respond to the mouse click. At
   this point, the only way to exit Visual FoxPro is from the Windows Task
   Manager.
