The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5

SUMMARY
=======

This article states the free disk space requirements for the Fault Tolerant
Upgrade, which involves upgrading from Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 to
version 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To successfully complete the upgrade process, the computer must have a local
disk drive (network drives cannot be used) with free space equal to (or greater
than) the size of all three (or four) Exchange Server databases. This disk will
be the location of the temporary directory specified during the upgrade process
in the Fault Tolerant window. The databases involved in the upgrade are
Priv.edb, Pub.edb, Dir.edb, and XDir.edb. XDir.edb exists if MS Mail dirsync has
been run against this server. Therefore, before you attempt to upgrade, add the
sizes of the Priv.edb, Pub.edb, Dir.edb, and XDir.edb files, and then add 2
megabytes (MB). Verify that the temporary file location that you specify has
sufficient free space to ensure that the upgrade can complete successfully.

The Fault Tolerant upgrade defragments each database and places the temporary,
defragmented .edb file into the specified directory. Temp is the default
directory. After all files have completed the defragmentation process, they are
copied to the location of the original .edb files, overwriting the original
files. The upgrade process removes the temporary files from the Temp directory.
Therefore, if the defragmentation process fails on any of the files, all of the
originals are still in place and the upgrade can be aborted.
