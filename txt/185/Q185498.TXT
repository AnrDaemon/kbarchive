Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

Vfphtml.exe contains three files: Hhctrl.ocx, Test.chm, and Htmlhelp.prg. The
example is dependent on the version of the Hhctrl.ocx file. These files allow
one to implement an HTML-style Help file within Visual FoxPro 3.0x or 5.0x. To
setup the files, use the following steps:

1. Unzip the self-extracting VfpHtml.exe file into a folder named Test.

2. Register the Hhctrl.ocx file following the instructions in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base article listed in the REFERENCES section.

3. Modify the program and change the values of the lcSampleHelp and lcHhctrl
   variables. These variables contain the locations of the Test.chm and
   Hhctrl.ocx files respectively. These files can reside in different folders as
   long as the variables contain the correct file locations.

4. Start Visual FoxPro 3.0x or 5.0x and run the program.

5. The HTML-style help appears on the screen.
