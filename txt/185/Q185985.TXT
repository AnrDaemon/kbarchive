The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server version 2.0

SUMMARY
=======

By default, you cannot include META information in query results from Index
Server version 2.0. This article shows how you can both query META information
and show this information in the result sets using Active Server Pages (ASP).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step 1
------

a. First the META information must be cached by Index Server. To do this, open
   the Index Server Management Console, and go to the property list for the
   content that has been indexed.

   If there are entries in the HTML document such as:

         <meta name="animal" content="Elephant">
    

   Then in the Properties list there should be an entry for "animal" under the
   Property Column, with a Property set of:

      d1b5d3f0-c0b3-11cf-9a92-00a0c908dbf1
 

   (The above is the globally unique identifier [GUID] for all META information.)

b. Right-click this entry, and then select Properties.

c. Check the option to cache this value. Set the Data Type to VT_LPWSTR. The
   default size should be acceptable for most string types.

d. To commit these changes, right-click Properties in the left panel and select
   Commit.

e. Re-scan the directories with the HTML files that have the META information
   required.

Step 2
------

a. To build an ASP to use this information, you must first define a Column using
   Q.DefineColumn. This requires the GUID given above.

b. To query just the META information, the query string must be preceded with
   @metaname (in this example @animal). This forces Index Server to query only
   the META information.

ASP Example
-----------

A sample ASP that uses this information follows. Remember to replace all
incidences of "animal" with your own Meta Tag Name. Note that the Q.DefineColumn
line is continuous with the line containing the GUID:

    <html>
    <head>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1">

    <%
    set Q = Server.CreateObject ("IXSSO.Query")

    Q.DefineColumn "animal (DBTYPE_WSTR) =
    'append to above    d1b5d3f0-c0b3-11cf-9a92-00a0c908dbf1 animal"

       Q.Query = "@animal Elephant"
       Q.Columns = "animal"
       set RS = Q.CreateRecordSet("sequential")

    %>

    <title>Sample Search</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <p>
    <%
    Do While Not RS.EOF
    %>
    <p>
    <b>Type of animal: </b><%= RS("animal") %>
    </p>
    <%
       RS.MoveNext
            Loop
    %>
    </p>
    </body>
    </html>
