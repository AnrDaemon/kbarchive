TITLE   :XFOR: Dr. Watson on Startup Due to Excess DNS Search Entries
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Upon startup of Exchange, the Internet Mail Service crashes with a Dr. Watson
log error message:

   Application exception occurred:
           App: MSEXCIMC.dbg (pid=167)
           When: 4/24/1998 @ 13:28:38.298
           Exception number: c0000005 (access violation)

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by the introduction through RegEdit, or other third-party
utility, of additional Domain Name Service (DNS) entries into the TCP/IP
configuration under DNS Suffix Search Order. There is a limit of six (6) entries
supported under Windows NT 4.0.

The Internet Mail Service attempts to parse these entries, and when attempting to
store the length of the seventh entry, triggers an access violation.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do not exceed the supported number of entries.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 5.0 and 5.5.
