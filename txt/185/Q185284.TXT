TITLE   :FIX: #import Does not Correctly Handle GUID Parameters
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINNT:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbVC600fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the #import directive on a type library with a method containing a
GUID as a parameter, or methods containing a structure that contains a GUID as a
parameter, you might encounter one of the following error messages:

   C2664: 'Method1' : cannot convert parameter 1 from 'struct _GUID *' to
   'struct GUID *'

   C2664: 'raw_Method2' : cannot convert parameter 1 from 'struct GUID' to
   'struct GUID'

   C2079: 'm_guid' uses undefined struct 'GUID'

You might also encounter one of these error messages when you use parameters of
type IID, CLSID, FMTID, UUID, CATID, and references to these types (REFGUID,
REFIID, etc.).

CAUSE
=====

The #import statement incorrectly interprets struct _GUID as struct GUID. GUID
is only a typedef for struct _GUID.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the "rename" attribute with #import to replace the string GUID with _GUID.
For example:

      #import "myproject.tlb" rename("GUID", "_GUID")

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in Microsoft Visual C++,
version 6.0.
