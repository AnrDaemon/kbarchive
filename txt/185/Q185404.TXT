SYMPTOMS
========

Case 1

When you reference a bookmarked table cell using a formula field, Word inserts an
incorrect value.

------

When you reference a bookmarked table cell using the Ref field, Word inserts a
table cell containing the correct value.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the appropriate method to reference the correct information in a table cell
or to use a value contained in a table cell in a calculation.

Method 1: Bookmark the Contents of the Table Cell
-------------------------------------------------

Do not bookmark the entire table cell. Ensure that the end of cell marker is not
selected when you set the bookmark in the table cell.

Use either a formula or Ref field to retrieve the contents of the bookmark.

   For example: {= bookmarkname} or {REF bookmarkname}

Method 2: Bookmark the Entire Table
-----------------------------------

Use the formula field to reference the appropriate table cell using the formula
{= SUM(bookmarkname cell)}.

   For example: {= SUM(table1 C3)}
