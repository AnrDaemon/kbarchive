TITLE   :Outwars: Sounds Are Distorted When You Play Game
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsound kbimu msgame outwars

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outwars, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you play Microsoft Outwars, the music and sound effects in the game may
sound distorted or the speakers or headphones may crackle and pop.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if Outwars transmits sound to the speakers or headphones
at a higher volume level or higher bass level than the speakers or headphones
are designed to play.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. If you use amplified speakers or headphones, verify that they are connected
   to the Line Out jack on the sound card. If you use non-amplified speakers or
   headphones, verify that they are connected to the Speaker Out jack on the
   sound card.

2. Start Outwars. If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next step.

3. On the Outwars startup screen, click Options.

4. Click Sound.

5. In the Sound Options screen, click the left Bass arrow to reduce the bass
   level in the game.

   NOTE: The Bass and Treble controls in Outwars do not affect audio output if
   your sound card does not support bass and treble adjustments.

6. If the issue continues to occur, click the left Master Volume arrow to reduce
   the volume level in the game.

7. Click OK, and then click Back.
