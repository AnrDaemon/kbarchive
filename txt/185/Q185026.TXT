The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Administrators of Microsoft Exchange Server will find that they cannot place
size restrictions on messages that are delivered locally.

Messages sent between users homed on the same Exchange Server computer do not
use the Message Transfer Agent (MTA) for delivery. Therefore, they are not
subject to the options available for external message control.
