PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word97 kbmerge

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Mail Merge command in Microsoft Word 97 by using a Microsoft
Access 97 query with ODBC as a data source and the database table is a SQL
Server link table, the following error message may appear:

   Word was unable to open the data source.

CAUSE
=====

When you use ODBC, you do not receive a dialog box allowing you to enter the
password, because the password needed to open your SQL data source is not passed
through Microsoft Access to the SQL server.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you insert the link table in the Microsoft Access database, click to select
the "Save password" check box in the Link Tables dialog box.
