Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience either of the following symptoms:

 - When you attempt to perform directory replication between two Microsoft
   Exchange Server computers, directory replication may fail.

 - If you attempt to check the knowledge consistency of an Exchange Server
   computer by clicking Check Now in the properties for the directory service,
   the following message is displayed:

   An internal error has occurred during directory replication. Stop
   and then restart the directory service. Then try directory
   replication again. ID no: c1030b0d

   In addition, the following event may appear in the event log:

      Event: 1124
      Source: MSExchangeDS
      Severity: Error
      Category: Knowledge Consistency Checker
      Description: The consistency checker encountered an internal error
      and can't continue checking the consistency of this directory. Stop
      and restart this Microsoft Exchange computer.
    


CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the Site value under the following registry key
contains an incorrect site name:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeSA
   \Parameters

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To work around this problem, follow these steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the Site value under the following key in the registry:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeSA
      \Parameters
  

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. Click String on the Edit menu, type the correct site name in the String box,
   and then click OK.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

5. Stop and restart the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant service. To do so,
   follow these steps:

   a. In Control Panel, double-click Services.

   b. Click the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant service, and then click
      Stop. If a dialog box appears stating that additional services will be
      stopped, note the services that will be stopped, and then click OK. All
      other Exchange Server services are stopped when you stop the system
      attendant.

   c. Click the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant service, and then click
      Start.

   d. Start any additional services that were stopped in step B.
