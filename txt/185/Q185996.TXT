TITLE   :XFOR: Internet Mail Service Takes Very Long Time to Start
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

On a Microsoft Exchange Server computer that contains a directory with a large
number of users, Address Book views, and recipient containers, the Internet Mail
Service may take an unusually long time to start.

CAUSE
=====

When you start the Internet Mail Service, it obtains the entire Address Book
hierarchy, even though it only needs the global address list (GAL). If the
Address Book hierarchy is very large, the Internet Mail Service takes a long
time to start.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you start the Internet Mail Service, it uses the Messaging Application
Programming Interface (MAPI) to obtain Address Book information from the Address
Book Provider dynamic-link library (Emsabp.dll or Emsabp32.dll). After you apply
the fix, the Internet Mail Service only requests the GAL.
