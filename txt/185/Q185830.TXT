TITLE   :Small Business Server Fax Ignores Retry Delay
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95; winnt:4.0,4.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server versions 4.0, 4.0a 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you set up the fax on the server to be available only at certain hours, the
fax server ignores the retry delay value and retries immediately if the target
fax is busy.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set the fax printer to be always available.

For Windows NT clients, a workaround is to configure the Discount rate period in
Control Panel, Fax Server Tool. Select the Send tab instead, and then at the
client choose to send the fax at discount rates (in Control Panel, Fax client).
Then the retry characteristics will be used. This selection is not supported on
Windows 95 or Windows 98 clients, however.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Small Business Server
version 4.0 and 4.0a. We are researching this problem and will post additional
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem only occurs if you set up the fax on the server to be available
only at certain hours. When sending a fax from a Windows 95 client and the
number called is busy, the server keeps retrying with no delay although you have
configured the fax service to wait a certain time between the retries.
