TITLE   :Memory Leak in Rasman.exe on Compaq Systems
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On Compaq systems where the Remote Insight Board (RIB) is installed, the Remote
Access Connection Manager Service (Rasman.exe) progressively consumes available
memory at the rate of 4 KB approximately every two seconds.

CAUSE
=====

The Compaq Remote Insight Board device (RIBWAN) is configured to accept incoming
calls when it should be configured for "Dial out only" operation.

RESOLUTION
==========

In Remote Access Service properties (Remote Access Setup), configure the RIBWAN
device for "Dial out only" operation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Remote Insight Board can be installed on Compaq Proliant and Prosignia
systems (with the exception of the Prosignia 200). This device is not used to
accept incoming RAS calls, and so should not be configured to accept them.

The third-party products discussed here are manufactured by vendors independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
