   holder in the Name box, and then type the MSN e-mail address in the E-Mail
   Address box.

7. Click the Servers tab.

8. Type smtp.email.msn.com in the Outgoing Mail (SMTP) box, and then type
   pop3.email.msn.com in the Incoming Mail (POP3) box.

   NOTE: If you gain access to MSN through a third-party ISP or local area
   network (LAN)--including DSL, Cable modem, or Satellite connection-- type
   secure.smtp.email.msn.com in the Outgoing Mail (SMTP) box.
