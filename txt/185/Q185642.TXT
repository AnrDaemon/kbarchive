To work around this problem, use the following Visual Basic for Applications
sample macro.

The following macro passes the RecentFiles(1).Name to the Documents.Open command,
with which you can specify a document password. The macro opens the first item
in the Most Recently Used(MRU) list. To specify another item in the list, use a
different number, such as RecentFiles(3).Name.

      Sub OpenRecentFileWithPassWord()

         If RecentFiles.Count >= 1 Then

            ' Replace "YourDocumentPassWord" with the password
            ' of the document to open.
            Documents.Open FileName:=RecentFiles(1).Name, _
               PasswordDocument:="YourDocumentPassWord"

         End If
      End Sub
