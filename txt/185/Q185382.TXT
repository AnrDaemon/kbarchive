SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the preferred steps to manually stop or start the
Inetinfo process in Internet Information Server (IIS) version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To unload the Inetinfo.exe process completely, and to make sure that all of the
extensions are unloaded properly, stop the IISAdmin service and the World Wide
Web Publishing Service.

When you start the Internet services on your computer, starting the IISAdmin
service only starts the IISAdmin service; however, starting the World Wide Web
Publishing service starts both the World Wide Web Publishing Service and the
IISAdmin service.

From the command line, do the following:

   net start or stop

      w3svc      World Wide Web Publishing Service
      iisadmin   IIS Admin Service
      msftpsvc   FTP Publishing Service
      cisvc      Content Index
      smtpsvc    Microsoft SMTP Service


In previous versions of IIS, you can stop the entire Web service by typing "net
stop w3svc" (without the quotation marks) at the command line. This terminates
all of the Web services on the computer, and shuts down the Inetinfo.exe
process. As a result of the new multiple Web site architecture, there is another
service, Iisadmin, that keeps running even when W3SVC is shut down. The same is
true for starting and stopping services from Control Panel. If you truly want to
unload the Inetinfo.exe process, and make sure that all of the extensions are
unloaded properly, you should now type "net stop Iisadmin" rather than "net stop
w3svc" (both without the quotation marks). Typing "net start w3svc" or "net
start Msftpsvc" (without the quotation marks) automatically starts Iisadmin.
