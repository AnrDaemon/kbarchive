TITLE   :XADM: Error Message "Custom Attribute (N) Is Unknown"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, when you attempt to import a
Comma Separated Value (CSV) file that contains a Custom Attribute (N) field, the
error message

   Custom Attribute (N) is Unknown

is returned.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur in some scenarios if you have renamed a custom attribute
in the Exchange Administrator program and then try to use the new name of the
field in a CSV file. Using the new name of the attribute in the CSV file will
return an error referencing this new name.

Renaming the attribute to its original name may not solve the problem, based on
which version of the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program you are using, and
the revision level of the directory on the server to which you are importing.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the directory name of the custom attribute in your CSV import header instead
of the display name.

The directory names of custom attributes are of the form

   Extension-Attribute-n

where n is the number of the attribute.
