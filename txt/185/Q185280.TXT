TITLE   :FIX: Printf Gives Unexpected Results for Doubles on WinCE
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows CE, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use any of the printf C run-time routines (printf, _vstprintf,
_stprintf, and so on) with the "%f" format specifier, you get unexpected
results. The printf C run-time routines return the floating-point format
specifier without the leading '%' instead of the text representation of the
number. For example, the following code gives the result "f" instead of
"1.23456789":

      _stprintf(pBuffer, TEXT("%f"), 1.23456789);

CAUSE
=====

This is a bug in the printf C run-time routines. The printf routines for Windows
CE do not support floating-point numbers.

RESOLUTION
==========

This has been fixed in version 2.0 of Visual C++ for Windows CE. To work around
this problem in version 1.0, you must manually convert the floating- point
number. You can use the _gcvt function to convert the floating-point number to
an ANSI string, and then use the "%S" format specifier in a printf routine to
convert the ANSI string to UNICODE.

For example, replace the following code:

      _stprintf(pBuffer, TEXT("%f"), 1.23456789);

with:

      char pTemp[256];
      _gcvt(1.23456789,9,pTemp);
      _stprintf(pBuffer, TEXT("%S"), pTemp);

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in Visual C++ for Windows
CE, 2.0.
