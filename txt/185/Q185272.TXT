The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a new document or open an existing document, the Office
Assistant may disappear or it may not be available, or both.

CAUSE
=====

You have an open document and are in-place editing an OLE object (such as a
Microsoft Excel worksheet).

WORKAROUND
==========

Switch back to the document (on the Window menu, click the document) containing
the OLE object, and move the insertion point out of the OLE object so that you
are no longer in-place editing. In some cases, you may need to close and then
reopen the document containing the OLE object.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This problem has been corrected in Word 2000.
