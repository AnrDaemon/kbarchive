TITLE   :XADM: Attached DBCS Message Not Displayed Properly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you attach a message that contains double-byte character set (DBCS)
characters to another message, and then use a DBCS e-mail client to send the
messages to a computer that is running the U.S. version of Microsoft Exchange
Server, the attached message may not be displayed properly when you open the
messages in another DBCS e-mail client. Depending on the specific DBCS clients
you use to send and receive the messages, the DBCS characters may be displayed
as question marks (?) or they may be unreadable.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the server uses the wrong codepage to convert the
messages. When this occurs, the DBCS characters in the attached message may be
converted to single-byte character set (SBCS) instead. This may cause the
characters to be displayed incorrectly when you open the message in a DBCS
e-mail client.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 2.
