======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The SelPrint Function of the RichTextBox Control now has an optional second
parameter that is not documented in the Online Help. The information below can
also be found in the Readmevb.htm on the Visual Basic 6.0 CD.

RichTextBox Control: SelPrint Method Has New Argument
-----------------------------------------------------

The SelPrint method now features a second, optional argument. The syntax and part
descriptions are shown below:

Syntax object.SelPrint(lHDC As Long, [vStartDoc])

The SelPrint method syntax has these parts:

Part          Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
object        An object expression that evaluates to a RichTextbox control.

lHDC          Long. The device context of the device you plan to use to
              print the contents of the control.

vStartDoc     Boolean. Specifies the behavior of the control regarding
              startdoc and enddoc printer control operations, as shown in
              settings.

Settings

The settings for vStartDoc are:

Constant        Value           Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
True            -1              (Default) The control retains its original
                                behavior and sends startdoc and enddoc
                                commands to the printer.

False            0              The control does not send startdoc and
                                Enddoc commands, but sends only startpage
                                and endpage commands to the printer.

Remarks:

The argument was added to remedy situations when printers do not print with the
default behavior. When the SelPrint method is invoked, both Visual Basic and the
RichTextBox control send startdoc and enddoc commands to the printer resulting
in a nested pair of startdoc/enddoc commands. Some printers respond only to the
first pair of commands and thereby become disabled when the RichTextbox control
sends the second pair. In that case, setting the vStartDoc argument to False
prevents the second pair of commands from being sent.
