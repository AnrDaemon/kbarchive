TITLE   :BUG: Cannot Navigate Columns If a Row in a Grid is Disabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnokeyword

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When one of the rows in a grid is disabled, after selecting the disabled row and
moving to the rightmost or leftmost column, the Right/Left arrow and the Tab
keys cannot be used to switch from one column to the other. However, the mouse
can be used to move from one column to another.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create and populate a table as follows:

         CREATE TABLE test (fld1 N(5), fld2 c(5))
         INSERT INTO test VALUES (85000,"aaaaa")
         INSERT INTO test VALUES (90000,"bbbbb")
         INSERT INTO test VALUES (75000,"ccccc")
         INSERT INTO test VALUES (60000,"ddddd")

2. Create a form and add the table to its data environment.

3. Drag and drop the table from the data environment onto the form to create a
   grid.

4. Place the following code in the grid's AfterRowColChange event:

         IF test.fld1>80000
            This.Columns(ncolindex).Enabled=.t.
         ELSE
            This.Columns(ncolindex).Enabled=.f.
         ENDIF

5. Run the form and use the Down Arrow key to move to the record that has 75000
   in the first column.

6. When the cell containing 75000 gets the focus, it is disabled.

7. Use the RIGHT ARROW, LEFT ARROW, or TAB key to move to the leftmost or the
   rightmost column in the row.

8. Once the focus is in the leftmost or rightmost column, using the LEFT ARROW,
   RIGHT ARROW, or TAB keys, try to move to some other column. Note that you
   will not be able to move to another column.

NOTE: You can use the Mouse to navigate from one column to another.
