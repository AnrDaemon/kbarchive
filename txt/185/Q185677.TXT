======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL), versions 2.0, 2.1, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2b 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 4.2b 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create an ATL service exposing a COM object, with a space in the name,
such as "A Service," you may see multiple instances of the executable. If you do
not have the HKCR\CLSID\{CLSID}\LocalServer32 key for the COM object, then you
may get an HRESULT of 0x80040154 (class not registered).

CAUSE
=====

This is a bug in the ATL wizard-generated code when you create an ATL NT-
service project with an embedded space in the service name. For example, if you
create "A Service," the wizard generated code installs "AService" as the service
name with the Service Controller Manager database, but registers "A Service"
under HKCR\AppID\{APPID}\LocalService.

When a client tries to create the COM object exposed by the service, COM attempts
to start "A Service," fails and starts .exe under the LocalServer32 entry
instead. As a result, you see multiple instances (one was a service that you
started manually from the Services application; the other a regular win32
process started by COM from the LocalServer32 entry). When the LocalServer32 key
is not present, you get an HRESULT of 0x80040154.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the resource editor, modify the string resource "IDS_SERVICENAME" to put the
spaces back into the service name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 6.0
for Windows.
