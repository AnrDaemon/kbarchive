TITLE   :INFO: "Invalid DOS path <drive>:<path>" when Adding Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe400 kbSSafe500

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you try to add a project to a Visual SourceSafe (VSS) database, Visual C++
(VC++) or other products may return the following error:

   Invalid DOS path <drive>:<path>

This may occur if the Data_Path variable in the Srcsafe.ini file points to an
invalid location.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When browsing for a database, VSS searches for the Srcsafe.ini file that is
installed in the server installation directory of Visual SourceSafe.

The error may occur for one of the following three reasons:

 - This is a new Visual C++ project.

 - The Visual C++ .opt file does not contain a valid path to the correct
   Srcsafe.ini file.

 - The Data_Path variable of the Srcsafe.ini referenced by VC++ is invalid.

By default, VC++ looks in the Windows registry at the path shown below to
determine where the default Srcsafe.ini is located:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SourceSafe = Value: SCCServerPath
        = {%INSTALLDIRECTORY%}ssscc.dll
