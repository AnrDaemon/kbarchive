SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Microsoft Golf, you may experience one of the following
symptoms:

 - You receive an error message similar to one of the following:

   - Golf9<x> caused an invalid page fault in module Dibeng.dll.

CAUSE

 - The Color Palette display setting is incorrect.

 - The monitor setting is incorrect.

 - One of more of the DirectX files is missing or damaged.

 - Multiple instances of a device are loaded when you start Windows.

==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Display.

3. Click the Settings tab.

4. In the Color Palette or Colors box, click High Color (16 bit).

5. Move the Desktop Area or Screen Area slider to the 800 x 600 setting.

6. Click OK. If you are prompted to restart the computer, do so.

   NOTE: If you are unable to change the resolution setting to 800 x 600, verify
   that the correct monitor is selected and that the monitor supports a
   resolution setting of 800 x 600.

If the display resolution is 800 x 600 or higher and the color palette is already

do this, follow these steps:

   key when you insert the Golf CD-ROM to prevent Golf from starting
   automatically.

2. Click Start, and then click Run.

3. In the Open box, type the following line and then click OK

   <drive>:\

   where <drive> is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive.

4. Right-click the DirectX folder, and then click Copy.

5. Close the CD-ROM drive window.

6. Right-click on the desktop, and then click Paste.

7. Restart the computer in Safe mode. To do this, use the appropriate method for
   your version of Microsoft Windows:

   Microsoft Windows 95
   --------------------

   Restart the computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, press
   the F8 key, and then choose Safe Mode from the Startup menu.

   Microsoft Windows 98
   --------------------

   Restart the computer, press and hold down the CTRL key after the computer
   completes the Power On Self Test (POST), and then choose Safe Mode from the
   Startup menu.

8. When Windows starts in Safe mode, click OK, and then double-click the DirectX
   folder on the desktop.

9. Double-click the Dxsetup.exe file, and then follow the instructions on the
   screen to reinstall DirectX.

10. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.
