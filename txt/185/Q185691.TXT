PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When SNA Server is configured to use an X.25 connection and configured to use
switched virtual circuit (SVC), the link service may stop responding (hang)
shortly after initialization. This problem has also been seen on X.25
connections supporting permanent virtual circuits (PVC).

CAUSE
=====

The X.25 link service was incorrectly calling Read Interface Record before
setting the link protocol parameters required by the driver.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 4.0. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for SNA Server
version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
