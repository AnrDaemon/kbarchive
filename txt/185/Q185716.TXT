TITLE   :Snalink.exe May Trap If the SNA Server Service Is Autostarted
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An application exception in Snalink.exe in function strncmp() may be generated
when restarting an SNA Server system that has the SNA Server service
(Snaservr.exe) configured for Automatic startup (in Control Panel, double-click
the Services icon). When this occurs, a Dr. Watson error log may be generated
that indicates an application exception occurred in Snalink.dbg. In addition,
the SNA Server computer may log a message similar to the following in the
Windows NT application event log:

   Event ID: 624
   Source: <Link service name>
   Creating dump file <snaroot>\traces\snadump.log for SNALINK.EXE

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs because Snalink.exe was making a call to the DMOD resource
locating code, but DMOD had not been initialized.

WORKAROUND
==========

To prevent the error from occurring, configure the SNA Server Service to be
started manually.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 4.0. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for SNA Server
version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K


MORE INFORMATION
================

The resource locating code now verifies that DMOD has been initialized
successfully before trying to access the shared memory.
