IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start your computer, you may notice that the following desktop icons
now appear as the default Windows icon:

 - My Computer

 - Network Neighborhood

 - Recycle Bin

 - Inbox

 - Microsoft Outlook

 - Internet

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you install, and then uninstall a program that has
the capability of changing these desktop icons. If you uninstall this type of
program, the icon files that are associated with these icons may no longer be
present on your computer, and the desktop icons may revert to the default
Windows icon.

RESOLUTION
==========

To restore an altered desktop icon to the original desktop icon, use the
appropriate method, and then restart your computer:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
