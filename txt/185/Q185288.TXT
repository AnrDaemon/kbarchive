PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbwizard kbATL kbOSWinNT400 kbVC500 kbVC600 kbDSupport kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add a new ATL Object to your project using the ATL Object Wizard,
Developer Studio might crash.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when InocuLAN's Local Realtime Monitor has been
configured to scan source files that are created, opened, and closed by the ATL
Object Wizard.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this problem, configure InocuLAN's Local Realtime Monitor to exclude
scanning files with the following extensions: .c, .cpp, .cxx, .h, .hpp, .hxx,
.idl, and .rc. To do so, complete the following steps:

1. Start InocuLAN's Local Realtime Monitor, and select the Files tab.

2. Select Exclude Specified Files from the File Selection box.

3. Click Add in the File Selection group, and add the file extensions listed
   above.

These are all text files incapable of carrying a virus, so they are safe to
exclude from virus scanning.

STATUS
======

This problem occurs on Windows NT 4.0 running InocuLAN 4.0.
