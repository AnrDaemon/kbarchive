SUMMARY
=======

This article covers the creation of a Web-aware Usercontrol that downloads
images from a public site from the Internet.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This example shows how you can create controls that are Web-aware:

1. Start Visual Basic and select the ActiveX Control (this creates a Usercontrol
   project) in the New Project dialog box. Add a picture control and a label to
   the Usercontrol project making sure to place the label above the picture
   control. Add the following code:

         Option Explicit
         Const vbAsyncTypePicture = 0

         Private Sub UserControl_AsyncReadComplete(AsyncProp As
         AsyncProperty)
           On Error Resume Next
           Set Picture1.Picture = AsyncProp.Value
         End Sub

         Private Sub UserControl_Initialize()
         'PLEASE NOTE:
         'The URL could be in the form of a shared directory,
         'FTP or a HTTP.  The convention below, is used as
         'an example only. Do not try to use this URL as it is
         'in fact bogus.
          UserControl.AsyncRead _
            "http://example.microsoft.com/example.jpg", _
             vbAsyncTypePicture
         End Sub

2. Add a Caption to the label:

         Label1.Caption = "Image View"

3. Rename the project to something other than Project1 and create the control by
   compiling to an OCX.

4. Start a new standard exe project and add the new control to it. When you
   place the control on the form, the image automatically appears.

You could just as easily add a timer to this project, and use it to change the
image number. You could also use a public variable that would enable your
control to communicate with the form and change the image from outside the
control.
