TITLE   :Zone: Wrong Game Is Displayed When You Click a Game Room Link
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv igz kbimu msgame

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Zone.com 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click a game room link in the Zone, the wrong game room may be
displayed.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if either of the following conditions are true:

 - You used a shortcut you created for an earlier version of the Zoneto enter
   the game room. Shortcuts created for earlier versions of the Zone may no
   longer point to the same game room.
 - An older version of the Web page for the game room is stored in your Internet
   cache.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the appropriate method.

Remove Old Shortcuts
--------------------

If you attempted to enter the game room using a shortcut, delete the shortcut.
Because the Zone now uses JavaScript to open game rooms, you can no longer make
a shortcut directly to a game room.

Empty Your Internet Cache
-------------------------

To do this, use the appropriate method for your Web browser.

Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.x and Later:

1. On the View menu (Internet Explorer 4.x) or Tools menu (Internet Explorer
   5.0), click Internet Options.

2. Under Temporary Internet Files, click Delete Files, and then click Yes or OK.

3. Click Settings.

4. Under "Check for newer versions of stored pages," click "Every time you start
   Internet Explorer".

5. Click OK, and then click OK again.

6. Quit and then restart Internet Explorer.

7. Connect to the Zone.
