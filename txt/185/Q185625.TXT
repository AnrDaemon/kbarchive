TITLE   :Windows NT Client Logon Fails with EnableSecuritySignature Set
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When SMB security signatures are enabled by setting EnableSecuritySignature to 1
on the server, a Windows NT Client logon attempt may fail. The failure will
occur if only a Lan Manager password component is present in the Windows NT
domain account. The following error will be returned by the client:

   Invalid user name or password...

CAUSE
=====

The server service performs an SMB security signature check and it fails in this
case. When a sessionsetupandx command is being performed, the check fails. The
server assumes that the client provides Windows NT credentials. The redirector
is incorrectly including the LanMan security information for security signatures
as if it were Windows NT security information.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


NOTE: The redirector is dependent on the server fix to operate correctly. Rdr.sys
must be installed on the client and Srv.sys must be used on the server to
address this issue successfully.

Service Pack 4.
