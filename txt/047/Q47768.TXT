The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS, versions 2.x, 3.01, 3.02, 3.04, 3.05, 3.51, 3.55 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The switches /Z1 or /NOI may appear in the following message when
linking with Version 3.55 or earlier of the linker:

   Unrecognized Switch <switch>

Such old versions of the linker can be found in the MS-DOS directories of
most distributed versions of MS-DOS.

If the MS-DOS directory is listed in the PATH environment variable before
the directory containing the correct version of the linker, the old
linker will be executed. Delete or rename this linker, or place the
DOS directory behind the proper linker's directory in the PATH.
