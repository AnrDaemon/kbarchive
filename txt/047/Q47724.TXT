SUMMARY
=======

Network license agreements do not exist for any Microsoft language products.
These agreements are currently available only for our application products.

According to the licensing agreement printed on the envelope that contains the
disks, our languages are licensed as single-user, single-workstation products
and cannot be used by more than one user simultaneously. The agreement does
allow users to share the software if they run it off the same workstation at
different times.

Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0 and Microsoft Visual C++ may be placed on a network
drive and shared by multiple users. However, the number of users who access the
network copy must never exceed the number of copies licensed by the owner of the
network.
