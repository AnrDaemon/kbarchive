SUMMARY
=======

Menu 3-Enviro, Option E, allows you to select Dynamic Scenery. Dynamic Scenery
adds scenery, such as other aircraft, airport service vehicles, boats, etc., to
make flight more realistic. This scenery may be moving around with you. Use the
menu options to select the type of objects and the scenery frequency: sparse,
medium, or complex.

Note: Because Flight Simulator does not detect other planes in your airspace,
planes go through you if you are in their way or sitting on the runway.
