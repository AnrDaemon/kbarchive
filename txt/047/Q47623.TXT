SUMMARY
=======

To use the Toshiba PageLaser II with Windows, the printer must be placed in HP
emulation mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Instructions for placing the printer in HP emulation mode are as follows:

1. Turn off the printer and install the emulation cartridge that comes with the
   printer in the top font cartridge slot labeled "fonts/emulation". This
   emulation cartridge allows the printer to emulate a number of different
   printers.

2. Press the Select switch to take the printer off line.

3. Use the Next and Previous buttons under Display Option until EMULATION is
   displayed on the LCD panel.

4. Use the Next and Previous buttons under Change Value to select the HP
   emulation mode.

5. The printer has now been temporarily placed in HP emulation mode for the
   current session. To store this emulation mode in memory for future sessions,
   the mode switch (located inside the right side door of machine) must be
   switched to the maintenance/setup (up) position, not the default normal
   position. When this switch is in the maintenance/setup (up) position, any
   changes are stored in memory and take effect the next time you power up the
   machine.
