======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, MS-DOS workstation, versions 1.37, 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you run the Microsoft Mail (PC Client) program before loading the AppleTalk
driver software provided with your AppleTalk network card, you may receive the
following message upon starting Mail:

   You need to run the AppleTalk device driver software before starting Mail.

This message may also appear if Mail did not locate the AppleTalk driver at a
specific software interrupt address. Mail keeps track of the AppleTalk driver's
location through the MAIL.INI file, which is located in the Mail program
directory.

AppleTalk protocol requires that the AppleTalk driver be loaded within the
software interrupt address range 5C-6F. PC Client Mail uses software interrupt
address 60 as the default value when locating the AppleTalk driver.

If Mail Setup locates the AppleTalk driver at a software interrupt address other
than 60, it will add the statement INT=XX to the MAIL.INI file to inform Mail
that the driver will not be found in the default software interrupt address. You
may also need to inform the device driver to load at this address through a
/INT=XX parameter (for example, ALAP /INT=60).

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem usually occurs with TOPS/DOS versions 2.10 and 3.00 and the
ALAP.EXE AppleTalk driver.

The following is a list of default software interrupt addresses used by the
AppleTalk-compatible network cards supported by PC Client Mail:

   Card                               Default Address
   ----                               ---------------
