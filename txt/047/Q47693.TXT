SUMMARY
=======

When initializing a union, the initialization value is applied to the first
member of the union even if the type of the value matches a subsequent member.
As stated in the ANSI Standard, Section 3.5.7:

      A brace-enclosed initializer for a union object initializes the
      member that appears first in the declaration list of the union
      type.

Because you cannot initialize the value of any member of a union other than the
first one, you must assign their values in a separate statement. Initializing a
union with a value intended for a subsequent member causes that value to be
converted to the type of the first member.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following example demonstrates the issue:

Sample Code
-----------

   /* Compile options needed: none
   */ 

   #include <stdio.h>
   union { int   a;
           float b;
         } test = {3.6};    /* This is intended to initialize 'b'      */ 
                            /* however, the value will be converted    */ 
                            /* (first to a long and then to an int)    */ 
                            /* in order to initialize 'a'.             */ 

   void main (void)
   {
      float dummy = 0.0;            /* This causes the floating point  */ 
                                    /* math package to be initialized.  */ 
                                    /* Not necessary with VC++ for     */ 
                                    /* Windows NT.                      */ 

      printf ("test.a = %d,  test.b = %f\n", test.a, test.b);
   }

The output from the example, though not what is intended, is as follows:

   test.a = 3, test.b = 0.00000

To associate a value with "b", you can reverse the order of the members, as in
the following:

   union {
           float b;
           int a;
         } test = {3.6};

Or, you can retain the order of the elements and assign the value in a separate
statement, as in the following:

      test.b = 3.6;

Either of these methods creates the following output:

   test.a = 26214, test.b = 3.600000

Under Windows NT, the output would be as follows:

   test.a = 1080452710, test.b = 3.600000
