SUMMARY
=======

Aspect Ratio is the ratio between the plane's span and the mean chord of its
wings. It is calculated by using the following formula:

   Aspect Ratio = Span/Mean Chord

Chord is the distance from the leading edge (front of the wing) to the trailing
edge (rear of the wing). Many plane wings taper (i.e., have greater distance
from the front to the back near the fuselage, than narrow-width at the
wingtips); thus, an average distance is computed (the "mean chord").
