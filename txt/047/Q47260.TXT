The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Mail version 3.0 allows you to send one or more files with your
message. When you attach files to a message, Mail copies them from your disk and
sends them on with the message. On receiving the message, the recipient can save
the enclosed files and then load them into the appropriate applications to work
with them.

Previous versions of Microsoft Mail did not support multiple file enclosures.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have a file enclosed with a Mail version 1.3x or 2.0 message and you try
to enclose another file, the new file replaces the previous file as the enclosed
file.

Additional query words: 1.35 1.36 1.37 2.00
