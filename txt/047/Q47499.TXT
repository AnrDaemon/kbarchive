SUMMARY
=======

Talk.exe is a sample application in the Microsoft Download Center that
demonstrates how to share data between two applications without having to use
dynamic data exchange (DDE). TALK contains two applications (POST and HELLO)
that demonstrate three different ways to pass information between two
applications. Please note that either the GMEM_DDESHARE or the GMEM_NOTBANKED
flag must be specified when the memory is allocated. This ensures that the
memory referenced by the handle is available even when Windows is running in
real mode and EMS memory is in use.

NOTE: Although the principles of message-based DDE communication shown in the
TALK sample are compatible with Windows 3.1, Microsoft strongly recommends that
new applications for Windows 3.1 and later use the DDEML library provided by the
system.
