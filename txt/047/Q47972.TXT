TITLE   :FIX: F1001: srclist.c:1.59, Line 1153, Invalid COMMON in SAVE
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0,4.01,4.1,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN compiler for OS/2, versions 4.0, 4.01, 4.1, 5.0 
 - Microsoft FORTRAN Compiler for MS-DOS, versions 4.0, 4.01, 4.1, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to compile an application fails and the compiler generates the
following message:

   fatal error F1001: Internal Compiler Error
   (compiler file '@(#)srclist.c:1.59', line 1153)

CAUSE
=====

The application specifies a non-existent COMMON block in a SAVE statement and
the compiler command line specifies the /F2 compiler option switch.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, remove the name of the undeclared COMMON block from
SAVE statement.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN version 5.0 for MS-DOS
and OS/2. This problem was corrected in FORTRAN version 5.1 for MS-DOS and OS/2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code example demonstrates this problem.

Sample Code
-----------

   C Compile options needed: None

         SUBROUTINE SUBR()
           SAVE /C1/, /TEST/ 
           COMMON /C1/ I, J, K
         END

To correct this error, remove "/test/" from the second line. If a subroutine and
a COMMON block have the same name and the compiler command line specifies the
/Fs compiler option switch, the following error occurs:

   fatal error F1001: Internal Compiler Error
   (compiler file '@(#)p3io.c:1.93',line 605)
