SUMMARY
=======

You can number more than one footnote or endnote with the same number in Word by
using the Footnote Reference field within a cross reference field.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Scientific journals generally require that all references to a source have the
same footnote number. They also require that the footnote be printed only once
for each source.

To number a footnote reference with the same number as another, use the following
steps:

1. Place the insertion point where you want the cross-reference to appear.

2. On the Insert menu, click Cross-Reference.

3. From the Reference Type box, select Footnote or Endnote. Choose the footnote
   or endnote you want to refer to, and click Insert.

4. If you want the cross-reference to be in superscript like the original, use
   the following steps:

   a. Show Field Codes by highlighting the cross-referenced item and pressing
      SHIFT+F9. A field similar to the following appears:

      {NOTEREF _Ref0123456789}

   b. Place the insertion point between the final number and the closing brace.

   c. Press the spacebar once, and type "\f" (without the quotation marks).

      The field will resemble the following:

      {NOTEREF _Ref0123456789 \f}

   d. With the insertion point in the field, update the field by pressing F9.

   e. Show the cross-reference by pressing SHIFT+F9.
