SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt from a Windows NT computer to connect to an AT&T Advanced Server
for UNIX printer share fails.

CAUSE
=====

The AT&T Advanced Server for UNIX is a Windows NT server on a UNIX network
environment. Windows NT computers view the print provider of the AT&T

2.x print server). The AT&T Advanced Server for UNIX provides full server
functionality except for the print server functionality (SpoolSS) to Windows NT
computers.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
