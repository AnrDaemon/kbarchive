TITLE   :PRB: Input/Output Operation Fails When Starting Visual FoxPro
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:3.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You receive one of the following error messages when starting Visual FoxPro
depending on which operating system you are using:

 - Input/Output Operation Failure.

 - This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down. If the
   problem persists, contact the program vendor.

CAUSE
=====

There are two main situations where this can occur:

 - Visual FoxPro was installed from the CD-ROM disc without installing the help
   files, and the CD-ROM disc is not in the drive.

   -or-

 - A project is opened that is stored on a removable media, such as a Bernoulli
   disk, that is not currently available to FoxPro.

RESOLUTION
==========

In both cases, the media that contains the needed files should be available to
FoxPro. In the case of the help file, re-run the setup program and install the
help file to the Visual FoxPro directory so that it will not require the CD-ROM
disc.

FoxPro, upon startup, does not care what the CD-ROM disc is so long as there is
one in the drive. Using the incorrect one will remove the error, but Help will
not be available and all Help options will be grayed out on the main menu.


STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Install Visual FoxPro without the Help file.

2. Start Visual FoxPro without no CD-ROM disc in the CD-ROM drive. It will
   terminate with one of the noted error messages.
