TITLE   :ATDISK Driver Fails to Start After Upgrade
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your computer uses an enhanced IDE controller and you upgraded your previous
installation of Windows NT to Windows NT 3.51. The following message appears
when you boot Windows NT:

   At least one service or driver failed during system startup. Use Event Viewer
   to examine the event log for details.

Event Viewer shows that the message is caused by ATDISK.

CAUSE
=====

Computers capable of connecting four Enhanced IDE (EIDE) devices actually
contain two separate EIDE adapters. Windows NT 3.51 uses ATAPI.SYS to handle
EIDE adapters, whereas ATDISK.SYS is used for only IDE and other WD1003
compatible disk controllers. In Windows NT 3.5, ATDISK.SYS handles the first
adapter's IDE drives. ATAPI.SYS handles ATAPI devices, such as CD- ROM drives
and hard disks, on the second adapter. When you update to Windows NT 3.51, ATAPI
takes over the IO addresses from the first IDE adapter. When ATDISK initializes
it cannot allocate the IO addresses and it terminates.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem,, run Control Panel, choose Devices, and manually
disable the ATDISK driver.
