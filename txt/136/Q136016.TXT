======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The AFIELDS() function has been enhanced in Visual FoxPro to allow the work area
or alias to be specified.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To place the structure of a table that is not in the currently selected work
area into an array, include the work area number or the alias name. If the work
area number or alias name is not included, the currently selected table is used,
which is the only behavior allowed in FoxPro version 2.X.

To test the difference in behavior run the following code in Visual FoxPro:

      CLOSE ALL
      USE C:\VFP\SAMPLES\MAINSAMP\DATA\Customer.dbf IN 1 EXCLUSIVE
      USE C:\VFP\SAMPLES\MAINSAMP\DATA\Employee.dbf IN 2 EXCLUSIVE
      SELECT CUSTOMER
      =AFIELDS(aMyarray,2)
      DISPLAY MEMORY LIKE aMyarray

Then run the following code in FoxPro version 2.X:

      CLOSE ALL
      USE C:\FPW\TUTORIAL\Customer.dbf IN 1 EXCLUSIVE
      USE C:\FPW\TUTORIAL\Salesman.dbf IN 2 EXCLUSIVE
      SELECT CUSTOMER
      =AFIELDS(aMyarray,2)
      DISPLAY MEMORY LIKE aMyarray

This code generates the error message "Too many arguments" in FoxPro version 2.x.
