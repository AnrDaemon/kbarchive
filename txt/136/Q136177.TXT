======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install PowerPoint on Windows NT Workstation version 3.51, the shared
components (the OLE programs, the spell checker, and the graphics and text
converters) are installed to the \Windows\Msapps folder. If you install
PowerPoint on Windows 95, the shared components are installed to the Program
Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared folder.


CAUSE
=====

Windows NT 3.51 does not use shared applications from the same location as
Windows 95 (Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared). Shared components such
as those that ship with PowerPoint are installed to the \Windows\Msapps folder.

Additional query words: 7.00
