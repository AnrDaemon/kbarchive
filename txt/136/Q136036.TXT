TITLE   :Supported Network Adapters Not Available in Remoteboot Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set up a profile in Remoteboot Manager (RPLMGR.EXE), some supported
network adapters are not available. The supported network adapters for
Remoteboot are listed on page 112 of the "Windows NT Server 3.5 (and 3.51)
Installation Guides."

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, use the default profile in Remoteboot Manager if you
are using any one of the supported network adapters listed below. The Remoteboot
Service for Windows NT identifies the network adapter by its vendor ID and
passes the correct network adapter driver to the computer.

The following supported network adapters are not available for selection in
Remoteboot Manager:

   3Com TokenLink
   3Com TokenLink III
   3Com 3Station
   Madge Smart Ringnodes
   IBM Token Ring
   Novell NE1000

NOTE: The Madge Smart Ringnodes network adapter is not listed in page 112 of the
Windows NT Server Installation Guides, but is one of the supported network
adapters for the Remoteboot service.
