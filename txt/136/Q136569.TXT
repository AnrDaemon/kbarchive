KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to view a Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) database that is
not participating in a Push\Pull relationship, the following error message
appears:

   The Windows Internet Name Service is not running on the target machine, or
   the target machine is not accessible.


CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when you set the view preference for the WINS server by name
only or by name and IP address.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, choose Options, choose Preferences, and change the
address display from Computer Name Only to IP Address Only. This will set the
view to IP Address until a method of name resolution is in place to resolve the
other WINS servers name.
