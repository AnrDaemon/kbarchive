SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running the Backup tool, if you click the Start Restore button to
begin restoring files from a backup set that spans multiple disks, and you then
click the Cancel button while the "Preparing Restore Operation" message is
displayed, you may receive the following error message:

   A serious error has occurred in Microsoft Backup. Quit Microsoft Backup and
   all other running programs, restart Backup, and then try again. If the
   problem persists, try reinstalling Backup. To reinstall Backup, look up
   'Add/Remove Programs' in the Windows Help Index.

If you click OK, Backup closes.

If you click the Cancel button at any time after Backup prompts you for the first
disk, or while the "Preparing Restore Operation" message is displayed when you
are restoring files from a backup set that does not span multiple disks, this
problem does not occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you want to cancel the restore process after you click the Start Restore
button when you are restoring files from a backup set that spans multiple disks,
wait until Backup prompts you for the first disk. You can then cancel the
process without receiving an error message.

If you do receive the error message stated above, click OK to quit Backup. If you
want to restore files, start Backup again.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
