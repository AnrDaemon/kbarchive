MORE INFORMATION

Programmatic Test
-----------------

Run the following code to determine if a table is free or belongs to a database:

        xyz = CURSORGETPROP("database")
        IF EMPTY(xyz)
           WAIT WINDOW "This is a free table!"
        ELSE
           WAIT WINDOW "This database " + xyz +" is open!"
        ENDIF

You can use a low-level utility or Visual FoxPro low-level functions to verify
the content of the .dbf header.
