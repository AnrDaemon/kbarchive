SUMMARY
=======

This article illustrates how to expand or collapse the Outline control in an OLE
Container control programmatically.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the Object property along with the Expand method to expand or collapse an
OutLine control. Here is the syntax:

      ThisForm.<OleControl>.Object.Expand(<n>)=.T.|.F.

The Object property provides access to the OLE Server properties and methods for
an OLE object, which in this case, is the Outline control. The numeric value
enclosed in the parentheses that follow Expand is the Index number of the item
that you want to expand.

Step-by-Step Example of Expanding and/or Collapsing an Outline Control
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Create a new form.

2. Click OLE Container Control on the Form Controls toolbar, and then click the
   form. The Insert Object dialog box appears.

3. On the Insert Object dialog box, click Insert Control. Select Outline Control
   from the Control Type list. Click OK to return to the Form Designer. The
   default Name of this object is OleControl1. For this example, do not change
   it.

4. Insert the following code in the OleControl1 Init event procedure:

      This.AddItem("U.S Auto Makers",0)
      This.AddItem("Chrysler ",1)
      This.AddItem("General Motors",2)
      This.AddItem("Ford",3)
      This.AddItem("Japanese Auto Makers",4)
      This.AddItem("Mazda ",5)
      This.AddItem("Nissan",6)
      This.AddItem("Toyota",7

      This.Indent(0)=1
      This.Indent(1)=2
      This.Indent(2)=2
      This.Indent(3)=2
      This.Indent(4)=1
      This.Indent(5)=2
      This.Indent(6)=2
      This.Indent(7)=2

5. Add two command buttons (Command1 and Command2) to the form and set their
   Caption properties to "Expand U.S. List" and "Expand Japanese List"
   respectively.

6. Place the following code in the Command1 Click event procedure:

      ThisForm.OleControl1.Object.Expand(0)=;
         !(ThisForm.OleControl1.Object.Expand(0)
      If ThisForm.OleControl1.Object.Expand(0)
         This.Caption="Collapse U.S List"
      Else
         This.Caption="Expand U.S List"
      EndIf

7. Place the following code in the Click event of Command2:

      ThisForm.OleControl1.Object.Expand(4)=;
          !(ThisForm.OleControl1.Object.Expand(4)
      If ThisForm.OleControl1.Object.Expand(4)
          This.Caption="Collapse Japanese List"
      Else
          This.Caption="Expand Japanese List"
      EndIf
