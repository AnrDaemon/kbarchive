TITLE   :Cannot Enter UNC Path for Windows NT Mail .MMF File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Windows NT 3.1 you can specify a universal naming conversion (UNC) path for
your .MMF file by choosing Options, and then Server, under the Windows NT Mail
Mail menu. In the Server dialog box you can choose the "Local" radio button and
the File dialog box allows you to enter a UNC path and filename for your .MMF
file. If you try these same steps under Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51, the following
error appears:

   STOP - The path you entered is invalid. Enter a valid filename.

WORKAROUND
==========

To connect to a logical network drive under Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51, choose
Options from the Mail menu, choose Server, and then enter the logical drive
letter, path, and filename in the Local field.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5 and 3.51.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
