PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error may appear in Event Viewer when you use Services for
Macintosh (SFM) on a Windows NT Server:

   Event ID: 12053 or 12054 or 12061 Session from user "USERNAME" was timed out
   and disconnected by the server. The AppleTalk address of the Macintosh
   workstation is in the data.

CAUSE
=====

The server generates the error when it has lost the connection with the
Macintosh client. The error may occur for any of the following reasons:

 - The Macintosh client has a file open on the computer running Windows NT
   Server and the server is restarted, or the Macintosh client is restarted,
   while the file is open.

 - The Macintosh client has a connection to the computer running Windows NT
   Server (no files open) and the server is restarted, or the Macintosh client
   is restarted.

 - When the network connection between the Macintosh client and the computer
   running Windows NT Server is broken because of possible network problems.

 - The Macintosh client receives a system error, such as a Type 1 or Type 11
   error, which forces the client to restart.



Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a text file on a Windows NT Server and place it in a directory shared
   as a Macintosh volume.

2. Open the file from a Macintosh client in Word for Macintosh.

3. Reset the Macintosh client while the file is open in Word.

4. Open Event Viewer on the Windows NT Server. It will have generated an Event
   ID 12053 or 12054.

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid this problem, make sure you close all files and connections to the
computer running Windows NT Server before you shutdown your Macintosh client.
