SUMMARY
=======

This article covers some of the most frequently asked questions (FAQ) about
Visual SourceSafe integration with Visual C++ version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Q. How should I set up Visual SourceSafe for a multiple-developer project
   with Visual C++ version 4.0?

   A. Please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q139358 INFO: Readme.wri: Section 1, Software Installation Information

   This article includes a detailed discussion comparing Setup.exe, which
   provides Server, Client, and Custom setups, with Netsetup.exe, which provides
   a Network Client setup from an existing Server installation.

2. Q. I have installed Visual C++ and Visual SourceSafe, but Visual SourceSafe
   is still not available under the Source Control menu in the Tools menu. Why?

   A. Verify registration settings found in the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q139358 INFO: Readme.wri: Section 1, Software Installation Information


3. Q. How do I add a Project Workspace to Source Code Control?

   A. If you have installed a Source Code Control Provider, such as Visual
   SourceSafe 4.0, the Tools Menu of the Developer Studio will offer a Source
   Control menu choice. This choice will offer a number of other options,
   including "Add to Source Control." You can use this option to place your
   newly created or existing project workspace under source code control.

4. Q. How do I open a Project Workspace that is under Source Code Control?

   A. Once you have installed a Source Code Control Provider, a new button will
   appear in the dialog box brought up by clicking Open Workspace on the File
   menu. This lets you choose a project currently under source code control, and
   open it just as you would open any project workspace stored on the disk.

5. Q. How does Visual C++ 4.0 show whether a given file or project is under
   source code control?

   A. Please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q136020 INFO: Glyphs in Visual C++ with Source Code Control Enabled

6. Q. I'm performing an operation to manage my project workspace, and the dialog
   box that comes up has an Advanced button that is unavailable (dimmed). Why is
   it always disabled?

   A. The support within Microsoft Developer Studio is designed to support any
   Source Code Control Provider that meets the required specification. The
   specification is generic enough so that if the provider wants to provide
   advanced features, it can through a standard interface. The Advanced button
   is part of that standard interface. Visual SourceSafe will take advantage of
   it where appropriate, and leave it disabled when it is not useful. Other
   providers may or may not take advantage of this as well.

7. Q. I have a project under Visual SourceSafe control. Why can't I make any
   modifications to my files in this project now?

   A. When anything is under Visual SourceSafe control, the files must be checked
   out of Visual SourceSafe before they can be modified in Visual C++. You can
   check files out either from within Visual C++, which is usually the preferred
   route for Visual C++ projects, or you can check out files within the Visual
   SourceSafe explorer.

8. Q. I have renamed a file in the Visual SourceSafe Explorer. Why is the file
   not renamed in Visual C++?

   A. Visual SourceSafe does not have a way to tell Visual C++ to rename a file
   in a given project. On the other hand, Visual C++, through the integration
   component, can tell SourceSafe that a file has been renamed. Therefore, the
   best way to rename a file is to do it within Visual C++. This will update the
   Visual SourceSafe Explorer.

9. Q. Where can I find additional information about Visual SourceSafe?

   A. Please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q134369 Microsoft SourceSafe Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

   This includes information on how to obtain further technical support as well
   as technical information.
