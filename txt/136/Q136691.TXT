TITLE   :GenMenu Differences Between FoxPro 2.x and Visual FoxPro
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

GenMenu.prg has been enhanced in Visual FoxPro by the addition of OLE support
and long filename support. The menu file format (.mnx) is unchanged in Visual
FoxPro. All .mnx and .mpr files created in FoxPro versions 2.x will work in
Visual FoxPro with no changes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because Visual FoxPro supports in-place editing of OLE objects, the NEGOTIATE
clause was added to the DEFINE PAD command to enable the developer to specify
where, if anywhere, a menu item should appear when an OLE server such as
Microsoft Excel has been activated for in-place editing. GenMenu.prg generates
the appropriate NEGOTIATE clause. It gets this information from the value stored
in the Location field of the .mnx file created by the Menu Designer.

Previous restrictions on .mnx and .mpr filename length have been updated for the
long filenames supported by Windows 95 and Windows NT.

Detailed information can be found in the revision history at the end of
GenMenu.prg.
