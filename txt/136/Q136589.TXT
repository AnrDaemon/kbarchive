SUMMARY
=======

The Setup Wizard writes control settings to the Wzsetup.ini file for use as
default settings the next time you use the Setup Wizard. This article describes
how Wzsetup.ini is used.

MORE INFORMATION
================

During initialization, the Setup Wizard looks in the startup (SYS(2004))
directory for the Wzsetup.ini file. If the file is found, it is used to
determine the most recent application directory for which disk images were
generated. If the Wzsetup.ini file is not found, you must specify the
application directory in Step 1 of the Setup Wizard.

When the application directory is known, the Setup Wizard looks for Wzsetup.ini
in that directory. If the file is found, it is used to set the controls to the
same values that were used when disk images were last created for this
directory. In this manner, the Setup Wizard remembers the various selections and
file customizations for each application you distribute.

When you click Finish and build disk images, the Setup Wizard writes Wzsetup.ini
to the application directory and to the SYS(2004) directory for use the next
time you use the Setup Wizard.
