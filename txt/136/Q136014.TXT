TITLE   :PCMCIA Card Does Not Work After Running PCMCIA Wizard
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you run the PC Card (PCMCIA) Wizard to install protected-mode socket
services for a PCMCIA card, you are instructed to shut down Windows 95 and then
turn your computer off and back on. If you restart your computer by pressing
CTRL+ALT+DEL, instead of turning the computer off and back on, you may receive
an error message stating that the PCMCIA drivers are not working correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The protected-mode drivers for the PCMCIA controller may not initialize
correctly when you restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL because the
real-mode drivers still have control of the device.

RESOLUTION
==========

Shut down Windows 95 and then turn your computer off and back on.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The real-mode drivers may remain in memory after a "soft" reset. You must turn
the computer off and back on to completely remove the real-mode drivers from
memory.

This issue is known to affect Databook controllers.
