KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to restore files using the Backup tool, you may be asked to enter a
password, even if you did not use a password when you created the backup set.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the information in the <backup_name>.qic file is
damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

The password information is contained on each of the backup disks. If you used a
password to create the backup set, you must enter the correct password to
restore the data.

If you are prompted for a password due to a damaged file on a floppy disk, you
may be able to restore the data from the other disks in the set.

If you backed up your files to a tape or a network drive, you may not be able to
restore the data if this problem occurs.


MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior can also occur if the Backup.exe file or another Backup component
is damaged. To resolve this issue, remove and reinstall Backup using the
Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.
