Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

To store sounds in a general field, open the general field, and then click Insert
Object on the Edit menu. The following steps add a sound to a Visual FoxPro
table, and produce the error.

1. Create or open a table that has a general field.

2. Browse the table and open the general field by clicking it or by selecting it
   and pressing CTRL+PGDN.

3. On the Edit menu, click Insert Object. Select Wave Sound from the Object Type
   box.

4. On the Sound Object box Edit menu, click Insert File, and select a wave file
   to add to the general field.

5. Close the Sound Object box. Save and close the general field.

6. In the Command window, type this command:

      @ 0,0 SAY <general field name> VERB 'PLAY'

   The sound stored in the general field will start to play, but then the error
   will occur. If you open the general field and click the sound, it will play
   correctly.
