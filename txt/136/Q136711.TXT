KEYWORDS:

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following message appears when you attempt to manually start a service from
Control Panel Services by selecting the service and specifying values in the
Startup Parameters field:

   Could not start the <service_name> service on \\<server_name>.
   Error 2140: An internal Windows NT error occurred.

This error typically occurs in conjunction with SRVANY.EXE, included in the
Windows NT 3.5 Resource Kit.

CAUSE
=====

This error results from an attempt to start a service with incorrect Startup
Parameters. Most default Windows NT services do not use the Startup Parameters
field so this error is uncommon.

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify that you are using the appropriate Startup Parameters for the service you
are attempting to start. To pass startup parameters to a service, select the
service, type the parameters in the Startup Parameters field, and then choose
the Start button.

SRVANY.EXE requires that you type in the full command-line, including the
application name and parameters associated with your service. Fully- qualified
path names should be used when specifying the application.

NOTE: Backslashes are treated as an escape character. You must type two
backslashes for each backslash in a parameter. For example:

   D:\\BINP\\B.EXE C:\\TMP\\MYEXE

For additional information on SRVANY.EXE read SRVANY.WRI included in the Windows
NT 3.5 and 3.51 Resource Kits.
