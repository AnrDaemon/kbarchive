SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to change the color of the "X" in a check box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The color of the actual "X" cannot be changed under program control. However, it
is possible to simulate this by using two bitmaps. The following steps show how
to achieve this.

1. Create two .bmp files, one with the check box containing an "X" the way you
   want it, and one with the check box empty.

2. When creating a check box on a form, change the Style property to 1-Graphical
   on the Property sheet. This makes the check box appear as a button.

3. For the Picture property, select the not-checked box .bmp file.

4. For the DownPicture property, select the checked box .bmp file.
