SUMMARY
=======

There are some places in Microsoft ClipArt Gallery 2.0 and Microsoft Clip
Gallery 3.0 where you will always see file extensions, even if you configure
Windows 95 to hide the extensions of registered file types.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you click on a thumbnail in the main screen of ClipArt Gallery, the status
bar always shows the complete path to the specified graphic, including its
extension. In Clip Gallery, if you click on a thumbnail and then click Clip
Properties, the Clip Properties dialog box also lists the complete path and name
of the graphic, including its extension. Also, if you update your thumbnails and
ClipArt Gallery can't find one of the graphics, the Update dialog box also lists
the file with its extension.

ClipArt Gallery and Clip Gallery provide this information to help you distinguish
between pictures that might have the same file name but different file types.
This information is also useful if you are using a Find ClipArt query, where you
can have ClipArt Gallery search for graphics by file type.
