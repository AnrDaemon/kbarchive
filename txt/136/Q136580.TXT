SYMPTOMS
========

It seems to take an unreasonably long time to save a form file.

CAUSE
=====

Other than hardware considerations such as a slow processor or minimal memory,
check for the following factors that may affect how long takes to save a form or
class file.

 - The size and number of Include files. That is, the number and size of files
   included with #INCLUDE preprocessor directive in the .scx files can
   dramatically affect how long it takes to save a form.

 - The form or the class contains a lot of objects with non-default properties
   and methods. This condition is particularly true if there are many levels of
   containment (for example, pageframes that contain other pageframes that
   contain a grid that contains a custom class, and so on).

RESOLUTION
==========

 - Avoid Include files when possible. If that is not feasible, instead of using
   the global Include file, specify the Include file in only those methods that
   require it. If you must use Include files, remove unused Defines and do not
   use nested Includes.

 - If feasible, move some of the objects into classes. That way when a
   particular .scx or .vcx file is being saved, much of the information will
   already be in the class definition thereby reducing the amount of data that
   must be written to the .scx file. When saving instances into classes, ensure
   that you move as much information into the class definition including
   methods.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
