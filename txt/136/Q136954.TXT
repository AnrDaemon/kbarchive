TITLE   :Disk Formatting Is Slow After Failing on Write-Protected Disk
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to format a floppy disk in Windows Explorer or My Computer, you may
receive the following error message:

   Windows cannot format this disk because it is write protected. If you are
   sure you want to continue, remove or move the write-protect tab, reinsert the
   disk, and then click Retry.

If you move the write-protect tab, reinsert the disk, and then click the Retry
button, Windows 95 formats the disk, but may take longer than normal to do so.
It may take up to three times longer than normal to format the disk.


RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, make sure that the disk is not write protected before you
try to format it.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
