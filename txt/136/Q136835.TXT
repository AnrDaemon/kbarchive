TITLE   :PCMCIA Hard Disk Not Available After Windows 95 Starts
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows 95 with a PCMCIA hard disk inserted in the computer's
PCMCIA slot, the hard disk seems to be recognized, but may not be available in
Windows 95.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if your computer does not have an IDE hard disk
controller installed. If there is no IDE hard disk controller installed, the
PCMCIA hard disk is assigned IDE port 1F0h. Because this port is normally
associated with the primary hard disk controller, Windows 95 treats it
differently from other IDE ports and does not assign it a drive letter.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the PCMCIA hard disk after Windows 95 starts, and then insert it in the
PCMCIA slot again.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
