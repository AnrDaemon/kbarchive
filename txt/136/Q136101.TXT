TITLE   :Err Msg: Receiver(s) Not Valid for Binary Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to send Rich Text Format (RTF) mail to an Internet address using the
CompuServe Mail provider for Microsoft Exchange, you receive the following
non-delivery report:

   The following recipients could not be reached...
   Receiver(s) not valid for binary message

CAUSE
=====

This message is returned by CompuServe. CompuServe's gateway to Internet mail
does not support sending binary attachments to Internet recipients. Since an RTF
message is sent as a message with a binary attachment, the message cannot be
sent.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you compose new mail for an Internet recipient using the CompuServe Mail
provider, do not enable the CompuServe Mail provider's "Send using Microsoft
Exchange rich-text format" option.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Exchange bundles RTF attributes into a special binary attachment file
called Winmail.dat. If an RTF message is addressed to both CompuServe and
Internet recipients, all the recipients receive an error message, even though
the CompuServe recipients may be capable of receiving a message with a binary
attachment.
