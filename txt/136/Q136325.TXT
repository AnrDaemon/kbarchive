======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Visual SourceSafe, files and projects can be dragged from one location and
dropped to another location. There are three operations that can be performed
with drag-and-drop: share, share and branch, and move.

 - Share. The files and histories are under multiple projects, but there is
   physically only one copy of the files and histories in the SourceSafe
   database.

 - Share and branch. Copies of the files and histories are made. The branched
   files maintain links to the original files.

 - Move. The project is moved to a new location.

This article describes the mouse buttons, keystrokes, and shortcut menus that
control which type of drag-and-drop is used.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When working with projects, the right mouse button drag-and-drop displays a menu
with the following options: share, share and branch, and move. The left mouse
button drag-and-drop is a share drag-and-drop, where a new subproject is created
under the target project, and the files from the source project are shared with
the new subproject.


In addition, when working with projects, pressing the ALT key or the SHIFT key
along with the left mouse button results in a share and branch drag- and-drop.

When working with files, the right mouse button drag-and-drop displays a menu
with the following options: share, share and branch, and in version 6.0, move.
The left mouse button drag-and-drop is a share drag-and-drop.

In addition, when working with files, pressing the ALT key or the SHIFT key along
with the left mouse button results in a share drag-and-drop.

To summarize:

   Share               left mouse button
                       right mouse button + Share on the shortcut menu

   Share and Branch    [SHIFT|ALT] left mouse button
                       right mouse button + Branch on the shortcut menu

   Move                right mouse button + Move on the shortcut menu (in
                       versions prior to 6.0 this option is only available
                       for projects.)

NOTE: It is not possible to do file moves.
