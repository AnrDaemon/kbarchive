TITLE   :PC DirSync: Err Msg: Fatal [161] Server Configuration Busy
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0a,3.2,3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.2, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error may be recorded in the DIRSYNC.LOG on a requestor
postoffice:

   Fatal 161 Server configuration busy

CAUSE
=====

The above error indicates that the postoffice was once designated a server;
however, it was later changed to a requestor. When this occurs, the SRVCONF.GLB
and MSTTRANS.GLB files are removed, but the T2 processes that were scheduled
still remain in the PROCESS.GLB. When Dispatch runs, it finds the NSDA -s
process scheduled and tries to launch it. However, because this is a requestor,
the postoffice records an error.

RESOLUTION
==========

Reset the PROCESS.GLB file using DEBUG:

   " debug process.glb <ENTER>
   -rcx <ENTER>
   xxxx
   :200 <ENTER>
   -w <ENTER>
   -q <ENTER> " (without the quotation marks)

Then schedule the T1 and T3 processes on this postoffice using the
Administrator's program (ADMIN.EXE) or the DSSCHED.EXE program included in the
"Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync)" document. For more information about how
to obtain this document, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q96060 PC DirSync: Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync)

MORE INFORMATION
================

If this error appears on the Dir-Sync server postoffice, make sure that
SRVCONF.GLB is not locked open or missing.
