TITLE   :FIX: Visual C++ Build Process Won't Return If Missing ')'
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::2.0,2.10,2.20
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 2.0, 2.10, 2.20 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the left parenthesis ')' is missing from the sample code listed below,
which uses template, the Microsoft Visual C++ version 2.x build process will not
return. However, you can choose Stop Build from the Project menu to cause the
process to terminate with the following messages:

   cl.exe terminated at user request.
   Tool execution cancelled by user.
   Test.obj - 0 error(s), 0 warning(s)

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, add back the missing parenthesis.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the products listed at the beginning
of this article. This bug was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition,
version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sample Code to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------------

   /* No special compile options needed
   */ 

   template <class T> class CTest
   {
   public:
      method();
   };

   template <class T> CTest<T>::method(() // Note the extra '(' here. The
                                          // compile on will never complete.
   {
   }
