SUMMARY
=======

Page 354 of the Developer's Guide, and the Help file topic "Populating Form
Controls" both specify incomplete instructions for populating the grid from the
results of a query. The text of both state "Set the RowSource or RecordSource
property to the cursor or table you specified in the SELECT - SQL statement."

MORE INFORMATION
================

Both resources should also state, "The RecordSource property needs to be
specified in the grid's property sheet in the Form Designer, and respecified by
means of the NEXT command after the SELECT - SQL command in the grid's Init
event."

The syntax to use for the grid's Init event is:

      This.RecordSource = <cursor name>

Reissuing the RecordSource property is required because the properties of the
grid are lost when the query is executed. They need to be reestablished.

REFERENCES
==========

For more information about the loss of properties of a grid populated by a
query, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
