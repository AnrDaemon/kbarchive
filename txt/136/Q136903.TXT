Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create one or more tables that has at least one space in its name.

2. In the View window, set a relationship on a common indexed field between this
   table, either as parent or as a child, and another table.

3. Save the open tables and relations to a view file by:

    - Clicking Save As on the File menu and entering a name, such as Spaces, in
      the Save View as dialog box.

   -or-

    - Typing CREATE VIEW Spaces in the Command window.

4. Either type SET VIEW TO Spaces in the Command window, or click Open on the
   File menu, choose View as file type, and open Spaces. At this point, an Open
   dialog box appears that prompts you to select a table.
