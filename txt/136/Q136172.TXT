The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you maximize or restore PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0, while you
have a custom background with one of the preset shades (Sapphire, for instance)
selected, your system may stop responding (hang). You will not have mouse
capability, and you will not be able to use the CTRL and TAB keys to switch
other programs. You will have to turn off your computer or, if your computer has
one, press the RESET button.

This problem occurs if you are using the Windows 95 S3 display driver.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you are using the S3 driver, avoid maximizing or restoring PowerPoint while
you are using slides with preset shaded backgrounds. Save your work often.

STATUS
======

We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
