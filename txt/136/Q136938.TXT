SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a shortcut that is configured to restart your computer in MS-DOS
mode, and you choose to specify a new MS-DOS configuration, the MS-DOS-based
program that the shortcut is configured to start may not be able to run if you
are using third-party disk compression software.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the Config.sys file that you specified for the
shortcut does not contain a line that loads the third-party disk compression
software.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the Config.sys file for the shortcut so that it contains a line to load
the third-party disk compression software. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Use the right mouse button to click the shortcut, and then click Properties
   on the menu that appears.

2. On the Program tab, click the Advanced button.

3. Add a line to load the third-party disk compression software in the
   "Config.sys for MS-DOS mode" box. For information about the correct
   parameters for this line, please consult the third-party disk compression
   software's manual or manufacturer.

4. Click OK.
