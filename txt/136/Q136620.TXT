SUMMARY
=======

This article explains the benefit of storing printer information in the Report
table (.frx file).

MORE INFORMATION
================

In FoxPro version 2.x, printer information is stored as binary format in the Tag
and Tag2 memo fields in the .frx file. There is no easy way for the developer to
change the orientation, paper size, and so on of the report once the .frx file
has been created.

In Visual FoxPro, this information is now stored as text in the Expr field of the
first record in the .frx file. Now, for example, if you need to change the
orientation of the report from portrait to landscape, you can look for the
"ORIENTATION=" setting in the first record of the Expr memo field, and change
the orientation from 0 to 1.

To see what the valid values are for a specified printer setting, use the
PRTINFO() function. For more information about the PRTINFO() function, search
for PTRINFO in the Help menu.
