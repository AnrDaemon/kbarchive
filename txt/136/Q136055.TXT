SUMMARY
=======

When you configure the Microsoft Windows 95 Inbox for both local area network
(LAN) and Remote configurations, there is a check box for Use External Delivery
Agent.

If the check box is selected, an external message transfer agent (MTA), such as
EXTERNAL.EXE included with Mail for PC Networks, is required to complete
delivery of the message.

NOTE: To configure the Inbox, in the Control Panel window, click Mail, then Fax.
Click the Services tab, then Microsoft Mail properties.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This option partially disables the Inbox from delivering the message. The
message is created and placed on the Mail for the PC postoffice; however, it is
not placed in the recipient's mailbag. Instead, it is placed in the P1 directory
(a temporary holding location), and it waits there until processed by the MTA.

By placing the message in the P1 directory, the client does not need to resolve
the addresses into mailbags and move the message into the mailbags. This speeds
up the delivery process for the client, but it does require the use of the MTA
to complete the delivery.

NOTE: This is helpful when you dial in remotely to the postoffice, but it can
also speed up the client when you use it on a slow LAN.

Without the MTA, no message from the client will ever be received by the
addressees. Do not select this option unless you are sure that an MTA is running
against the Mail for PC Networks postoffice.

NOTE: A loop-back message (message sent to yourself) will be sent in this
situation.
