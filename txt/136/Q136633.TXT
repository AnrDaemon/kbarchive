TITLE   :Reconnecting a RAS Line Without a User Logged On
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT Remote Access Services (RAS) can be configured to reconnect to a
remote server when a line fails, however, the Remote Access client application
(RASPHONE.EXE) must be running for the line to automatically reconnect.
Consequently, if a user is not logged on at the time of the line failure, RAS
will not automatically reestablish the link.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To enable the Redial on link failure option, choose Redial Settings from the
Remote Access Options menu.

The ability to reconnect a RAS link when no user is logged on is being considered
for future versions of Windows NT. To achieve this functionality now, write your
own service or use a third party product. Somar ReDial, by Somar Software,
allows a RAS link to be reconnected when no user is logged on. Somar Software
can be reached at http://www.somar.com or 72202,2574 on CompuServe. Other 3rd
party vendors may also provide similar solutions.
