SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector (IMC) sends Non Delivery Reports
(NDR) and Out of Office (OOF) messages to bulk mailing lists.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Messages that come into the IMC from a bulk mail distribution service, such as a
listserver, have a SMTP header of Precedence with a value of junk or bulk. The
IMC ignores this header and sends NDR and OOF reply messages to the bulk mailing
list.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack 2. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
