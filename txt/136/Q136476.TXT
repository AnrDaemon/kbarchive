TITLE   :Third-Party PPP Clients Cannot Connect to Windows NT RAS Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

From your computer running third-party PPP remote access software, you are
unable to connect to a Windows NT Remote Access Service (RAS) server even though
your user account is in the user accounts security (UAS) database of the Windows
NT domain on the remote network.

This symptom does not occur when you connect to a Windows NT RAS server using a
Microsoft Windows NT RAS or Windows for Workgroups RAS client.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT RAS server cannot find your user account because it is not a
member of the Windows NT domain and, therefore, does not have a local copy of
the domain UAS database that contains your user account.

Also, your third-party PPP client software does not provide a domain field
equivalent to the Microsoft Windows NT RAS or Windows for Workgroups RAS
software Domain field to tell the RAS server to look for your user account in
the UAS database of the domain you specify in that field. Therefore, the RAS
server searches only its own local UAS database.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, contact your administrator to:

 - Configure your RAS server as a backup domain controller (BDC) for the domain.
   A BDC keeps a replicant copy of the domain UAS database locally.

   -or-

 - Create a user account for you with RAS dial-in permissions in the RAS
   server's local (non-domain) UAS database.

   -or-

 - Type your user name in using the following syntax:

   <domain>\<username>

   where <domain> is the WIndows NT domain to which the <username>
   account belongs.
