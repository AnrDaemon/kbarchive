KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

An answer file is a text file that is used in conjunction with Setup to bypass
normal Setup prompts. An unattended installation is run by specifying the /U
switch with Winnt.exe or Winnt32.exe. For example:

   WINNT /U:{Answer File} /S:{Source Files}

Windows can use the answer files:

   Product                             Default Answer File
   -------------------------------------------------------
   Windows NT Resource Kit 3.5         Unattend.txt
   Windows NT Resource Kit 3.51        Unattend.txt
   Windows 2000 Resource Kit           Unattend.txt

MORE INFORMATION
================

The answer file can be modified with any text editor or by using Setup Manager,
included in the Windows NT and Windows 2000 Resource Kit.

An answer file can also be created by using Uplodprf.exe.

Note: This answer file is included with the Resource Kit for versions of Windows
NT 3.5, and 3.51.

Uplodprf.exe must be run from the system you intend to profile. UPLODPRF uses the
following command line syntax:

   uplodprf -p:{AnswerFile} -b- -u- -n- -r- -x -i:{inffile}

   -p:AnswerFile  Output an answer file for use with unattended setup.

   -b-            The boot sector will not be copied (all other processing
                  is still performed.)

   -u-            Do not generate a user account definition file.

   -n-            Do not dump ACLs of files in the profile

   -r-            Do not dump the registry key ACLs

   -x             Do not copy files to sharedir.

   -i:inffile     INFFILE is the file containing the instructions for
                  processing the Windows NT computer for redistribution.

The following informational messages may result after running the above command.
They can be ignored.
