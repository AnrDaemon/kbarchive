SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a Logitech mouse model M-M30 or cc-93-9f on COM1, and you
have a modem connected to COM2, the mouse may stop working.



RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Connect the Logitech mouse to COM2.

   NOTE: Before you unplug your mouse, turn off your computer.

2. Reconfigure the modem to use COM1. To reconfigure your modem, refer to the
   instructions included with the modem, or contact the manufacturer.

   NOTE: If you have an internal modem, disable COM1 using your computer's CMOS
   utility, then set your modem to COM1, IRQ4. For instructions on making
   changes to your CMOS settings, please see the documentation that came with
   your computer or contact the manufacturer.

3. In Control Panel, double-click the Modems icon.

4. Click the modem you are using, and then click Properties.

5. On the General tab, click Communications Port (COM1) in the Port box, and
   then click OK.

After you follow these steps, all 32-bit communications programs will find the
modem on COM1 correctly. You must manually configure 16-bit communications
programs to use the modem on COM1.
