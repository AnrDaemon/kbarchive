TITLE   :Installing Windows NT on a Hard Disk Configured with EZ-Drive
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Windows NT on a Conner hard drive configured with the EZ-Drive
utility, one of the following error messages appear:

   Hard drives are not usable by NT

   -or-

   NT cannot access the partitions prepared by DOS

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the Windows NT Compatibility Mode (also called Floppy
Boot Protection in later versions of EZ-Drive) is not enabled for a computer
using a hard drive that does not have logical block addressing (LBA) capability.
If the system has LBA capability, then the EZ-Drive Overlay Manager does not
need to be used.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, enable the Windows NT Compatibility Mode. To enable the
mode, do the following:

1. Backup the contents of your hard disk.

2. Insert the EZ-Drive disk in the floppy drive and type "EZ" (without the
   quotation marks).

3. From the menu list, select Windows NT Compatibility Mode.

4. Save and exit the EZ-Drive utility.

5. Reboot the computer. You do not need to repartition or reformat the hard
   disk. If you wish to remove the EZ-Drive Overlay Manager once it has been
   installed and the LBA options enabled in the CMOS, type the following at the
   MS-DOS prompt:

   FDISK /MBR
