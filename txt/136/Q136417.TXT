TITLE   :No Sounds in Da Vinci eMAIL After Restarting Windows 95
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95 appscomp kbAppCompatibility

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Although you use the Sounds tool in Control Panel to assign sounds to events in
Da Vinci eMAIL, the sounds are no longer assigned the next time you start
Windows 95.

CAUSE
=====

When you assign sounds to Da Vinci eMAIL events, the information is written to
the registry. However, when the Da Vinci eMAIL program starts, it looks for
sound information in the Win.ini file. If it does not find sound event
information in the Win.ini file, it creates sound event entries in the [sounds]
section of the file, but does not assign default values to the entries.

The next time you start Windows 95, the blank entries for Da Vinci eMAIL sound
events are copied automatically to the registry, overwriting the entries you
created using the Sounds tool.

RESOLUTION
==========

Please contact the program's manufacturer to inquire about a possible upgrade to
the program that resolves this issue.

STATUS
======

This situation is most likely caused by design changes in Windows 95. Microsoft
has confirmed that it is not caused by a problem in Windows 95.

================
