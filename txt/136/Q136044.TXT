The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

For a Visual FoxPro Application to present a small icon in the Windows Explorer,
it must have a 16X16 icon resource. ImagEdit, provided with Visual FoxPro,
allows you to create this resource.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To add this ability to ImagEdit, modify the ImagEdit.ini file in the Windows
directory by adding the following two lines:

      [ImagEdit.Icon]
      Win95=16,16,16

Then you can start ImagEdit, and load an icon. Click Edit...New image and select
Win95 16X16 as the type of resource. Create your 16X16 image.

Save the image under a new name. You can then use this resource in a FoxPro
application. When Windows 95 needs the small icon in Explorer, or in the Start
menu, your small icon will be used.
