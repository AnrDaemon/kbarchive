TITLE   :INFO: Changing Visual SourceSafe User Name in Visual Basic
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe

KEYWORDS:kbSSafe400 kbSSafe500 kbVBp400

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Under Windows NT and Windows 95, Visual Basic automatically tries to connect to
Visual SourceSafe with your operating system's userID. If the logged in user has
permission to see the SourceSafe server and there is a SourceSafe user with the
same ID, the user is assumed to have already been validated and SourceSafe
performs no additional password validation. If there is no SourceSafe user by
that name, the login dialog is displayed and the user ID of the currently logged
on user is placed in the user ID field.

This behavior is by design. However, it means that there is no way to change the
default Visual SourceSafe user to anyone but the currently logged in SourceSafe
user. In most situations, this is the behavior you want. However, this article
describes how to log in as a different SourceSafe user than the one currently
logged on the machine.

MORE INFORMATION
================

One method is to use an ID for SourceSafe which is not your user ID on your
Windows NT or Windows 95 machine. Then you will be prompted for your ID and
password every time.

Another suggestion is to create a new set of icons for the SourceSafe Explorer
and SourceSafe Administrator. Use the -y parameter in the icon's command line
definition, as shown here:

         <path to VSS>\win32\ssexp.exe -yadmin

         <path to VSS>\win32\ssexp.exe -yadmin,<password>

         <path to VSS>\win32\ssadmin.exe -yadmin

         <path to VSS>\win32\ssadmin.exe -yadmin,<password>
