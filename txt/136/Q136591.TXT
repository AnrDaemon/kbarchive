PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:3rdpartynet win95 kb3rdPartyNetClient

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks does not synchronize time with your
preferred NetWare server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To synchronize time with a server, include the following line in your login
script or in a batch file in your Startup folder

   net time -s \\<NetWare server> /y

where <NetWare server> is the name of the server you want to use.

The Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services behaves similarly to the
Novell VLM client. This service automatically synchronizes time with the server
unless the following command is encountered in the system or user login script:

   set_time {on | off }

MORE INFORMATION
================

Novell's redirector, NETX, automatically synchronizes time with the preferred
server if the following statement does not appear in the Net.cfg file:

   set station time = off

You can also synchronize time with NETX using the "set_time {on | off }"
statement in a login script.

For additional information about these statements, consult your NetWare
documentation or local Novell reseller.

For information about synchronizing time with Microsoft Windows NT servers,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q90334 Using NET TIME Command to Set Workgroup Clocks

You can also type the following command at an MS-DOS prompt for the "net time"
statement syntax:

   net time /?
