SUMMARY
=======

This article describes some points to remember in multiple-language development.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual FoxPro does not currently support Unicode. Windows NT supports Unicode,
but Windows 95 does not.

Windows 95 has the concept of mixing code pages within a document, and
associating code pages with sections or with fonts. FoxPro does not. The code
page is a system-wide setting, and all fonts and sections within FoxPro are
interpreted according to the FoxPro code page setting (read in from the system
on startup). It is highly inadvisable to use extended characters in table names
that will be ported across platforms or code pages, because currently most
operating systems do not translate filenames on copy, so internal references to
that filename that are translated will no longer match.
