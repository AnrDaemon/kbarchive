======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to start a program that requires access to the Internet after you
enable the "Connect to the Internet as needed" feature in Microsoft Plus! for
Windows 95, Windows 95 may not automatically dial the Internet using the Dial-Up
Networking connection you specified.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the Internet program you are using does not support
the 32-bit Windows sockets that are included with Windows 95. 16- bit Internet
programs and 32-bit Internet programs that do not support the 32-bit Windows
sockets included with Windows 95 cannot use the AutoDial feature of Microsoft
Plus!.

RESOLUTION
==========

To determine if the Internet program that you are using supports the 32-bit
Windows sockets included with Windows 95, or for information regarding a
possible software upgrade that will allow you to use the AutoDial feature of
Microsoft Plus!, please contact your software manufacturer.
