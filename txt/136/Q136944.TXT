TITLE   :PRB: Cannot Ignore Activate Event When It Contains an Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a form or an object's Activate event has code that generates a syntax
error, it is not possible to click Ignore to skip the offending code without
reactivating the Activate event.

CAUSE
=====

When an error is generated, the Error message window is displayed. When the
error window is closed, control returns to the object. When the focus returns to
the object, the Activate event fires, and the error appears again.

RESOLUTION
==========

Click Cancel to cancel the execution, and return to the form object.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

FoxPro does not control the firing of the Activate event. It is automatically
fired by the operating system.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form.

2. In the Activate event handler, type "&x" (without the quotation marks).

3. Save and run the form. The error "Unrecognized Command Verb" appears.

4. Click Ignore. The error appears again, until you click Cancel.
