SUMMARY
=======

Visual C++ supports integration with a source code control provider, such as
Visual SourceSafe. The color and glyphs used in File View reflect the state of
any given file within a project workspace relative to source code control.

The information in this article is valid independent of the source code control
provider you use, but is specific to Visual SourceSafe.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In FileView, if a given file is under source code control, the "file glyph" is
one sheet of gray paper, folded in the right corner. If the file is not under
source code control, the file glyph is one sheet of white paper, folded in the
right corner. If the file is under source code control and is shared with
another project, the file glyph is two sheets of gray paper folded in the right
corner. Files checked out from the source code control provider have a red check
mark to the left of the file glyph.

It is possible to create a resource script and check it out, but not check out
underlying image files used by the resource script. Developer Studio is smart
enough to prompt you to check out, for example, the underlying .bmp file before
allowing you to start editing a toolbar bitmap. If you do not check the file
out, you will not be able to save any changes you make to the bitmap file.

NOTE: For non-text files, only one user can effectively check the file out at a
time.
