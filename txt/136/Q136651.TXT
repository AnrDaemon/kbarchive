TITLE   :Shutdown Hangs After "Please Wait While..." Screen
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:


 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you click the Shut Down The Computer option in the Shut Down Windows
dialog box and then click OK, your computer may stop responding (hang) or
display a black screen after you see the "Please wait while your computer shuts
down" screen.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused by an incompatibility between the Windows 95 Advanced
Power Management (APM) system and the APM-capable BIOS in your computer. If the
BIOS in your computer instructs the system to suspend, rather than shut down,
Windows 95 cannot shut down correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

As a temporary workaround, disable APM support. To do so, double-click the Power
icon in Control Panel, and set the Power Management setting to Off.


To resolve the problem, contact your computer manufacturer to inquire about a
BIOS upgrade that resolves the problem.
