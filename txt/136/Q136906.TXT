SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to print from Encarta using the StyleWriter 1200 with an
installed printer driver version 2.0, you receive the following error message:

   There is a problem with your printer setup. Please use the Chooser to make
   sure a printer has been selected.

Reinstalling the printer driver and selecting the printer through the Chooser
does not correct this problem.

WORKAROUND
==========

There is no resolution to this problem if the installed printer driver is
version 2.0. However, upgrading to Microsoft Encarta, 1995 edition for the
Macintosh solves the problem.
