PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you re-enable a disabled CMD PCI controller in Device Manager and click OK
when you are prompted "Do you want to restart your computer now," the computer
beeps repeatedly and stops responding (hangs). Or, the computer may restart
normally but the CMD PCI controller may remain disabled in Device Manager.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 does not support dynamic disabling and re-enabling of PCI IDE
controllers.

RESOLUTION
==========

To re-enable the CMD PCI controller, use either of the following methods:

Method 1
--------

Reinstall Windows 95. To do so, run Setup from the command prompt.

Method 2
--------

1. Restart your computer in Safe Mode. To do so, restart your computer, press
   the F8 key when you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, and then choose
   Safe Mode from the Startup menu.

2. In Control Panel, double-click System.

3. On the Device Manager tab, double-click the Hard Disk Controllers branch to
   expand it.

4. Click the CMD PCI IDE controller, and then click Remove.

5. Once the device is removed, restart Windows 95 normally. The CMD PCI
   controller should be redetected automatically. After Windows 95 installs the
   drivers for the controller, restart the computer.
