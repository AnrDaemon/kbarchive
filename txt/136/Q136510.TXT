TITLE   :Unexpected Behavior with ALT+<num> Key Combinations in Notepad
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win31 win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you type an ALT+<number> key combination in Notepad, you may
experience unexpected results. Rather than generating an ANSI character from the
current codepage, the key combination may perform a task, such as cut or copy.
For example, the ALT+22 key combination performs a paste operation.

CAUSE
=====

Each of the first 32 characters in the current codepage has an associated
control character. If a control character also represents a task in Notepad,
that task is performed when you enter the key combination. For example, ALT+22
corresponds to the control character CTRL+V, which represents the Paste command
in Notepad.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
