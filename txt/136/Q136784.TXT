TITLE   :PC WRmt: Err Msg: Error in Converting RNETWORK.GLB
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install or update the address list in Mail Remote for Windows, you may
get the following error:

   Error in Converting RNETWORK.GLB

CAUSE
=====

This error may be caused by a lack of free disk space on the local hard disk
during the conversion process.

Another cause of this error is not enough files and buffers set in the CONFIG.SYS
file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Free up disk space on the local hard disk where Remote Mail is trying to perform
the conversion of RNETWORK.GLB.

This can be done by removing unnecessary files, such as .TMP or .CHK files. The
default location where RNETWORK.GLB is converted is where the Microsoft Windows
operating system is installed, usually C:\WINDOWS. If Windows is installed on a
drive other than C: (such as D:\WINDOWS), then disk space should be cleared on
that partition or hard disk.
