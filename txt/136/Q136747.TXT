 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing Windows 95, you may receive the following error message
and your computer may stop responding (hang) when the hardware detection portion
of Setup reaches 100 percent complete:

   Setup Detection Warning
   Warning SU0014
   Setup has found a hardware device on your computer that is not responding. To
   try this device again, click Continue.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if one of the following network adapters is installed in
your computer:

 - SMC EtherPower 10/100 (9332) PCI Ethernet Adapter

 - Thomas-Conrad TC5048 PCI Ethernet Adapter

 - 3COM EtherLink 3 #3c509 ISA Plug and Play Adapter

 - Cabletron E2200

 - DEC450 (21041) Network Adapter


When the hardware detection process is finished, Setup checks to make sure that
all critical hardware devices are still functioning properly. If any of these
devices do not respond, the error message stated above is displayed. The devices
listed above are known to cause the computer to hang when Setup attempts to
check their status.

RESOLUTION
==========

Turn the computer off, wait a few seconds, turn it back on, run Setup again, and
choose Safe Recovery when you are prompted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The process that Setup uses to check the status of devices installed in the
computer may cause a device to become unstable. When this occurs, turning the
computer off and back on again reinitializes the device.
