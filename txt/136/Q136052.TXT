2. Select any folder.

MORE INFORMATION

The Macintosh client is essentially the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS
workstation with a Macintosh front end. However, the MS-DOS client does not

In the MS-DOS environment, you must run the Mail Administrator program
(ADMIN.EXE) and select Local-Admin, Storage, Compress to optimize the disk space
taken by all folders within the Mail database.
