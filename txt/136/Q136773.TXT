SUMMARY
=======

This article shows how to create a connection that can be used by several users,
and it shows how to base a view on the connection. The view gets the user name
and password without prompting for it.

To achieve this, set the userid and password properties of the connection
programmatically as users log in. To modify the userid and password properties
of a connection, the database (.dbc file) must be opened exclusively.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you create a connection, such as this:

       CREATE CONNECTION myconnect ;
          DATASOURCE sqlsrvr ;
          USERID sa ;
          PASSWORD passwd

you can create views based on this connection, and then modify the connection at
run time to allow each user to use this connection. To change the userid and
password properties of the connection, use DBSetProp() in the following manner:

      ...=DBSetProp('myconnect','connection','userid','<newuserid>')
      ...=DBSetProp('myconnect','connection','password','<newpassword>')

This connection uses the new userid and password to log in. You need exclusive
use of the .dbc file to make this change.
