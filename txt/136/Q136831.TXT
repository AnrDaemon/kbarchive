PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows 95 on a computer with an ATI Graphics Pro Turbo Mach64
PCI display adapter and a PCI version 1.0 motherboard, Setup may install the
driver for an ATI Graphics Pro Turbo Mach64 VLB display adapter instead of the
ATI Graphics Pro Turbo Mach64 PCI display adapter.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because of an invalid string in the ATI BIOS revision 1.01.
ATI has a new BIOS, revision 1.2, that supports PCI 1.0 and 2.0 specifications,
and corrects the problem described above. For additional information, please
contact ATI Customer Support.

RESOLUTION
==========

To install the correct display driver, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Display icon.

2. On the Settings tab, click Change Display Type.

3. In the Adapter Type area, click Change.

4. Click the Show All Devices option button.

5. In the Manufacturers box, click ATI Technologies. In the Models box, click
   ATI Graphics Pro Turbo PCI (Mach64).

6. Click OK until you return to Control Panel.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The only difference between the VLB and the PCI driver is that the VLB driver
does not support some of the advanced PCI features, such as PCI Burst mode.
