SUMMARY
=======

This article demonstrates how to expand a combo box programmatically. This may
be useful when a user presses the TAB key to move into the combo box or when a
command button Click event procedure gives the focus to the combo box. It is
assumed that you have a combo box on a form and are looking for ways to activate
it programmatically.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Following are two methods for expanding a combo box programmatically:

Method One: Using Pixel Coordinates
-----------------------------------

Place the following code in the GotFocus method of the combo box:

      tCol=THISFORM.Combo1.Left + THISFORM.Combo1.Width - 4
      tRow=THISFORM.Combo1.Top + 2
      MOUSE CLICK AT tRow, tCol PIXELS WINDOW (THISFORM.Name)

The combo box expands every time it receives the focus.

---------------------------------

Place the following code in the GotFocus method of the combo box:
