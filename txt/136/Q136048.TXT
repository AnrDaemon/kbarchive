-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run GIMPORT.EXE in a Microsoft Windows NT MS-DOS command prompt, the
program may display the following error message and then quit:

   Error Adding .NME record. Out of Memory!

CAUSE
=====

GIMPORT.EXE needs expanded and/or extended memory to run. The default MS-DOS
Command prompt in Windows NT does not provide the required expanded or extended
memory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To create a MS-DOS Command prompt with available expanded or extended memory, a
new .PIF file needs to be created. This can be done using the PIF Editor Applet
in the Main group of Windows NT.

To create a PIF file, follow the steps below:

1. Open the PIF Editor from the Main group of Windows NT.

2. Type in "CMD.EXE" (without the quotation marks) as the Program Filename.

3. Type in "GIMPORT DOS prompt" (without the quotation marks) as the Window
   Title.

4. Save this file.

5. Create an icon for this new PIF file in the Main Group.

Use the icon you created in step 5 to open a command prompt to run GIMPORT.EXE.
It should run normally in the new command prompt.
