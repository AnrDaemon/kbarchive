SUMMARY
=======

After receiving an Internet mail message with Microsoft Exchange, the size of
the mail message may grow if you edit the message. The size of the message may
grow even if you remove text from the message. This occurs because edited
Microsoft Exchange messages are converted to Rich Text Format (RTF).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Exchange uses RTF for messages. RTF includes additional information
with the message to provide format information such as fonts, colors, and text
styles.

When you receive a message from the Internet, this additional information is not
included in the message. When you edit the message, the additional information
is added, even if you do not include special formatting in the message.

Additional query words: email
