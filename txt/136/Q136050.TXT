TITLE   :PC Gen: Err Msg: Error Sorting Members of Group...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you extract postoffice address list (POL) group information using
GIMPORT.EXE versions 3.1 or earlier, the following error message may be
displayed and logged (if a log file is specified):

   Error sorting members of group <group name>

where <group name> is the name of a postoffice address list group.

When this error occurs, no members from the affected group are extracted.

CAUSE
=====

The ADMINSHD.GRP( and ADMIN.GRP) file contains the tid values for all the
members belonging to a particular group. When one or more of these tid values in
the .GRP file are invalid, the above error message is generated.

A tid may become invalid due to corruption of the ADMINSHD.GRP file or if a user
belonging to a group is removed from the POL.

The error can also be caused by corruption of the POL.

WORKAROUND
==========

In versions 3.1 or earlier of GIMPORT.EXE, use the -S command line option to
workaround this problem. The -S option turns off sorting the members of the
groups being extracted.

In versions 3.5 or later of GIMPORT.EXE, this problem has been resolved and
invalid tids belonging to a group are ignored.

================
