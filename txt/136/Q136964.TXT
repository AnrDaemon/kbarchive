The Windows NT Event Viewer Clear All Events option allows you to clear
the contents of the current Event Viewer log. If you choose this option,
Event Viewer will ask you if you want to save the log before clearing it.
If you choose yes to save the log before clearing it, you will be
presented the Save As common dialog box. After you enter the file name and
desired destination of the file and choose the OK button, the Save As
dialog is cleared and Event Viewer asks if you are sure you want to clear
the log. Choosing the Yes button results in the file being saved and the
log being cleared. However, if you choose No, the file is not saved and the
log not cleared.

This behavior is by design, however, it may be confusing because the Save
File action is tied to the Clear All Events action.
