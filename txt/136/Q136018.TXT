TITLE   :PRB: "Incorrect Syntax Near 'Like'" ODBC Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error can occur when updating data from a memo field in a remote
view to a SQL Server database table:

   Connectivity error: [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server] Incorrect
   syntax near 'Like.'

CAUSE
=====

You are using the 16- or 32-bit 2.0 SQL Server ODBC drivers in Windows for
Workgroups or Windows NT. The error occurs because the 2.0 ODBC drivers map the
memo field incorrectly to the back end data source.

NOTE: This is just one of several possible reasons for this error.

WORKAROUND
==========

There is no workaround under Windows version 3.11. However, if you are using
Windows NT version 3.51, you can install the Windows 95 ODBC drivers. This will
upgrade the 2.0 ODBC drivers to the 2.5 version.


STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
