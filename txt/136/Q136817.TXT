SUMMARY
=======

Editing preferences can be saved by clicking Options on the Tools menu and
changing values in the Edit tab.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To gain access to the editing preferences, click Options on the Tools menu. You
must be using a resource file in order to use this option. If you have set
resource off, the check box for "Save Preferences" and "Set as Default for .xxx
Files" will be disabled. The "xxx" is the type of the file you are using, such
as .prg or .txt.

The Options Dialog box contains options for text manipulation and file saving.
These settings are in effect when you edit text in the Code window or Editing
window.

When you click "Set As Default," Visual FoxPro saves all the options in all the
tabs to the resource file. Again, this is only true if you are using a resource
file.

If the "Set as Default" check box and command button are disabled and the "Save
Preferences" check box is enabled the reason is that you can only save the
preferences for the currently-active editing window.

For example, if you open a new program editing window, change some editing
preferences, click the "Set as default" button, and then open a second program
editing window, you will not have the default editing preferences that were set
for the first window. Instead, you will have the editing preferences that were
in effect when Visual FoxPro was started.

If you exit Visual FoxPro and restart it, the settings you saved by clicking the
"Set as Default" button will apply to all new program files you create.

If the "Set as Default for .xxx files" check box is enabled, you will be able to
set the default for all files that have the .xxx extension; that is, if you set
as default for .prg files, all .prg files that are edited will have access to
the same defaults.
