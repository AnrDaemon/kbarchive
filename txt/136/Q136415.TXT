SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing Windows 95, you may receive the following error
message:

   SUWIN caused a General Protection Fault in module SUWIN.EXE at 0006:6EB8

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur when you upgrade an installation of Windows 3.x with more
than 1200 TrueType fonts installed. This error halts Setup and may require you
to restart your computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can still run Windows 3.x after you receive this error message. Remove some
of the TrueType fonts in Windows 3.x so that the total number of installed
TrueType fonts is 1200 or less, and then run Windows 95 Setup again.
