TITLE   :How NULL Values Sort in Indexes
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Expression indexes that evaluate to NULL are inserted into the .cdx file before
non-NULL entries, so NULL expressions in indexes sort at the beginning rather
than at the end.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a program called Myprog.prg.

2. Key in the following code fragment:

      CREATE TABLE mytable (lastname c(20) NULL, firstname c(20) NULL, ;
         city c(20) NULL)
      INSERT INTO mytable (lastname,firstname,city) ;
         VALUES ("Ansarti","Jim","San Jose")
      INSERT INTO mytable (lastname,firstname,city) ;
         VALUES ("Hayden","Rance",.NULL.)
      INSERT INTO mytable (lastname,firstname,city) ;
         VALUES ("Putnam","Phil","New Orleans")
      USE mytable
      INDEX ON city TAG city          && Create the Index and the Tag
      SET ORDER TO city               && Set the order to the Tag
      BROWSE

3. Save the program.

4. In the Command window, type:

      DO Myprog.prg

5. When the program runs, it displays a Browse window where the first record
   containing .NULL. in the city field is the first field in the Browse window.
