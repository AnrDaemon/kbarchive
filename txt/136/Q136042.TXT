======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the length of the string assigned to x with the x=replicate("X",105) command
is less than or equal to 88, then ?set('topic') returns a blank. Note that
set('topic') returns values only when the length of the string assigned to x is
longer than 88 characters in an incremental fashion. For example, if you use
x=replicate("X",89), set('topic') returns 1(one) x. If you use
x=replicate("X",98), set('topic') returns 10 x. So, the value returned by
set('topic')=(LEN(x)-88).

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not use messages greater than 88 characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
