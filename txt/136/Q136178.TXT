SUMMARY
=======

When you install PowerPoint for Windows 95 on Windows NT Workstation, version
3.51, you get an icon for Graphics Link. When you install PowerPoint on Windows
95, you do not get a shortcut for Graphics Link, although the program is copied
to your hard disk in both cases.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Even though PowerPoint for Windows 95 includes a Genigraphics Wizard, PowerPoint
also contains Graphics Link so that those who are familiar with it and prefer it
may continue to use it.

Graphics Link is a dedicated communications program that you can use to send
presentations to Genigraphics for imaging.
