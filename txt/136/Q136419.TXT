TITLE   :PPT7: Unexpected Results Overlapping Two Semi-Transparent Object

SYMPTOMS
========

In PowerPoint you can apply semi-transparent color fills to an object. A
semi-transparent fill creates a see-through effect, allowing you to see through
an object to whatever is behind it. However, if you overlap two objects that
both have a semi-transparent fill, you lose the see-through effect. Where the
two objects overlap, only the color of the object on top is visible.

CAUSE
=====

When a semi-transparent fill is selected, color is placed in alternate pixels.
When two objects with semi-transparent fills are overlapped, the same pixel
locations are being used by both objects at the overlapping area (so that only
the color from the object on top is visible).

WORKAROUND
==========

In order to have the see-through effect, an object filled with a semi-
transparent fill must be placed over an object with a solid fill. Solid fills
can be shaded, patterned, or textured.
