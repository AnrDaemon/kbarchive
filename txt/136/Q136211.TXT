TITLE   :PRB: SETUP.APP Creates Disk Image too Large for a Floppy Disk
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Setup.app to create disk images of your application, the resulting
files that are supposed to fit on one blank floppy disk occupy more space than
you have on a blank floppy disk.

CAUSE
=====

This may be caused by a virus-checking software package by Central Point
Software. When the Visual FoxPro .exe file is created, the virus-checking
software creates a file with a .vir extension and places it in the same
directory as the .exe file. When the .exe file is run on a computer that is
running Central Point's virus-checking software, the .vir file is checked.

NOTE: Central Point Software is a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.

The .vir file can vary in size. If Setup.app created a disk image that is close
to the capacity of the floppy disk size you are using, it could be that the .vir
file is just enough to exceed the capacity of a blank floppy disk. You would
discover this situation when you try to copy the contents of the disk directory
to a blank floppy disk and receive an error informing you of the insufficient
disk space.

WORKAROUND
==========

Remove the .vir file from the disk directory in which it is located. The
contents of the disk directory should then fit on a blank floppy disk.
