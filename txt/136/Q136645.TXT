 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows 95-based computer using an Ungermann-Bass network adapter does not
boot from a Microsoft Windows NT or Novell NetWare server.

CAUSE
=====

Ungermann-Bass network adapters cannot switch from real mode to protected mode
using the Microsoft Client for Microsoft Networks or the Microsoft Client for
NetWare Networks to boot from a network server.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the Novell NETX or VLM client software to boot from a NetWare server. To
boot from a Windows NT server, you must use a different network adapter that can
switch from real mode to protected mode.
