TITLE   :XCLN: Alias PST Inbox Not Highlighted for Unread Messages
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You can create an alias .PST file (that is, you can add a duplicate Personal
Folders information service pointing to the same .PST file). However, two
Personal Folders items will appear in the folder view pane of the main window.

When an unread message is moved or copied into the duplicate personal folder, the
name of the folder containing the unread message is not displayed in bold
letters.

CAUSE
=====

This is by product design. Two messaging services that point to the same .PST
file is not a supported configuration.


Additional query words: boldface
