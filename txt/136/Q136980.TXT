SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Table Designer to enter a field validation rule and the rule
uses the NOT operator in the expression, you will receive the following error in
Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups:

   terminated.

Under Windows 95, you may receive one of the following error messages:

   -or-

   Expression is Not Valid Outside of WITH/ENDWITH

The error message you receive will vary depending on your configuration.

CAUSE

This is caused by a syntax error when entering the expression. By entering:

      NOT.EMPTY(field1)

instead of:

      .NOT.EMPTY(field1)

-or-

      NOT EMPTY(field1)

you will receive the error.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
