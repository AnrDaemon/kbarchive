TITLE   :Browser Service Causes Network Broadcast Storm After 1193 hrs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT Server 3.51 starts a broadcast storm on the network with browser
frames after the Windows NT Server Service has reached the System Up Time of
1193 hours, which means it has been running continuously for 1193 hours or
multiples thereof. These broadcast frames are sent out on all installed
protocols. The broadcast storm typically last less than 5 or 6 minutes and then
stops by itself. The broadcast browser frame types that appear are the "Host
Announcements" or the "Local Master Announcements" frames, which are typically
sent out every 12 minutes.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51.

A supported fix is now available for Windows NT version 3.5, but has not been
fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this
fix. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.


This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
