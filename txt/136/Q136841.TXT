OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Automap Streets for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to locate an address where the street name is a combination of
a number and two compass points, the address may not be successfully located.
For example, you may not be able to locate the following address:

   W 100 North St

RESOLUTION
==========

To find a street where the name consists of a numbered street name with multiple
compass points, such as East or North, enter the address as:

   W 100_North St

where the actual street name is

   W 100 North St

MORE INFORMATION
================

The address search routine used by Automap Streets version 4.0 was designed to
use only one compass direction per address. When multiple directions are used to
name a street, the program tries to match the search request using the most
common street naming convention.

Additional query words: fails failed search address street auto auto-map automap reference
