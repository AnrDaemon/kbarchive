SYMPTOMS

You cannot drag folders to the message window or move folders or messages within
the message window. This means that you can move a folder from the message
window (right pane) into a folder in the folder window (left pane) to create a
subfolder (right to left).

You can also move messages from the message window into a different folder in the
folder window. However, you cannot move a folder from the folder window into a
folder in the message window (left to right).

CAUSE
=====

This is by product design.

MORE INFORMATION

Show/Hide Folder List button when the folder view is not displayed. You can also
use the View option from the Folders menu to switch the folder view on and off.
