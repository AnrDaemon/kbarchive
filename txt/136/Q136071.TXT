======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When an error occurs while executing an object's Error event procedure, Visual
FoxPro suspends execution and displays the error message. Even an ON ERROR
routine currently in effect is ignored. The Visual FoxPro Help file gives the
following information about the Error event:

   If a second error occurs in the Error event procedure while it is handling an
   error, Visual FoxPro calls the ON ERROR routine.

This is incorrect. When an error occurs while executing an object's Error event
procedure, Visual FoxPro suspends execution and displays the error message. Even
an ON ERROR routine currently in effect is ignored.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If code placed in an Error event handler can itself generate an error, place all
error-handling code within the ON ERROR routine.

An object's Error event procedure is triggered when there is a run-time error in
a method of that object. Using the Error event allows you to define code to
handle an error at the object level.

Code to Reproduce Behavior
--------------------------

      SET PROCEDURE TO SYS(16)
      ON ERROR DO procerror

      oform1=CREATE('myform')
      oform1.SHOW
      read events

      DEFINE CLASS myform AS FORM
        ADD OBJECT cmd1 AS CommandError
      ENDDEFINE

      DEFINE CLASS CommandError AS COMMANDBUTTON
         TOP=5
         LEFT=10
         WIDTH=50
         PROCEDURE CLICK
            wiat WINDOW     && Error in code. Calls the error event
         ENDPROC

        PROCEDURE ERROR
         PARAMETERS x,Y,z,T
            WAIT WINDOW u    && Another error. Should call the ON ERROR
         ENDPROC
      ENDDEFINE

      PROCEDURE procerror
        WAIT WINDOW "this is an error"
