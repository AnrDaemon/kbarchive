The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When a database is opened in SHARED mode, it is automatically marked READONLY in
the Database Designer. Therefore, the object definitions in the database cannot
be modified. This article describes the settings that affect whether a database
is opened in EXCLUSIVE or SHARED mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The most straightforward way to make sure you open a database in the mode you
want is to explicitly use the keywords EXCLUSIVE or SHARED in the OPEN DATABASE
command. If these keywords are left off, Visual FoxPro uses the global EXCLUSIVE
setting currently in effect. This setting is originally read from the registry,
but it can be changed with either the SET EXCLUSIVE command or through the menus
(on the Tools menu, click Options. Then click Data, and select the Open
Exclusive check box.
