TITLE   :DOC: Incorrect Description of Array Created by ADBOBJECTS()
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdocfix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Visual FoxPro Help file gives the following incorrect information for
ADBOBJECTS():

   A two-dimensional array is created when you specify RELATION for cSetting.
   Each row in the two-dimensional array corresponds to a relationship in the
   database. The first column in an array row contains the name of the parent
   table, and the second column in an array row contains the name of the child
   table. The third column contains the name of the index tag for the parent
   table and the fourth column contains the name of the index tag of the child
   table.

This documentation error has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0 and 3.0b for
Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Actually, the child table's information is displayed in the columns before the
parent table's information is displayed. Therefore, the information in the
ADBOBJECTS() topic should say:

   A two-dimensional array is created when you specify RELATION for cSetting.
   Each row in the two-dimensional array corresponds to a relationship in the
   database. The first column in an array row contains the name of the child
   table, and the second column in an array row contains the name of the parent
   table. The third column contains the name of the index tag for the child
   table and the fourth column contians the name of the index tag of the parent
   table.
