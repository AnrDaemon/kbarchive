TITLE   :PRB: Spell Checking Edit Box Contents Does Not Work
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error appears if you place an edit box on a form, set its
ControlSource property to a memo field from a table, and then try to run the
FoxPro Spell Checker on that memo field:

   Window on top is not a text editing window.

CAUSE
=====

The FoxPro Spell Checker works in a text-editing window only. Examples of
text-editing windows are the windows opened by the MODIFY COMMAND command and
the editing window opened from a memo field in a Browse window.

An EditBox control is not a text-editing window. Consequently, the Spell Checker
will not run. You can test for the window on top by opening the Debug window and
entering "wontop()" as the condition to test for while a form is running and an
edit box is the current control. The debug window will show that the form is the
current window.

WORKAROUND
==========

To use the Spell Checker to spell check a memo in a form, first open a text-
editing window. To do this, use the MODIFY MEMO command.

Create a form and place an EditBox control on it, and set its ControlSource
property to a memo field in your table. Use the following code to run the MODIFY
MEMO command:

1. In the DblClick event procedure of the EditBox, enter this code:

      MODIFY MEMO NOTES NOWAIT
      * opens a text editing window that displays the memo field
      * assuming the memo field is called "notes"
      * the "nowait" clause allows execution to continue

      DO (_SPELLCHK)
      * the _spellchk system variable references the spell checker that
      * will be executed by FoxPro

      CLOSE MEMO NOTES
      * this closes the text editing window after the user exits the
      * spell checker

2. Alternatively, add a command button to the form, and enter the same commands
   in the Click event procedure for the button.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
