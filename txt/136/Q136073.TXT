The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
 - Microsoft LAN Manager, version 2.2c 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 98

SUMMARY
=======

To have a logon script batch file call another batch file, you have to write it
specifically for the type of client logging on to the network. This article
gives an example of how to write such a batch file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT is currently the only client that uses a Universal Naming Convention
(UNC) connection for the logon script. If your Windows NT logon script contains
the commands NET USE and PAUSE, you see a connection to:

   \\LogonServer\NETLOGON

in the Windows NT logon command prompt window.

By design Windows 98, Windows 95, Windows for Workgroups, and LAN Manager connect
to the NETLOGON share using the Z: drive. If you use any Windows or LAN Manager
version and your logon script contains the commands NET USE and PAUSE, a
connection to drive Z: for LogonServer\NETLOGON can be seen in the logon command
prompt window.

To create logon script batch file that will call another batch file, and will be
used at Windows NT workstations as well as Windows for Workgroup workstations,
write the batch file so it can handle the difference between Windows NT and
other clients. The following example batch file could be used as a logon script
that calls a batch file from the NETLOGON share.

   if "%OS%" == "Windows_NT" goto NT_OS
   CALL z:\other.bat
   EXIT
   :NT_OS
   CALL other.bat
   EXIT
