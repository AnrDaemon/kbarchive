-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The 3-D Surface graph is not available as one of the graph types in the Graph
Wizard. However, you can select the default graph from within the Graph Wizard,
and then change the graph type to the 3-D Surface graph once in Microsoft Graph.
Or you can use OLE automation. This article shows by example how to do it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Issue the following commands in the Command Window:

      OPEN DATA C:\Vfp\Samples\Data\Testdata.dbc
      CREATE QUERY

2. Select the Orders table.

3. On the Query menu, click Query Destination, and select the Graph option.

4. Using the right mouse button, click the Query Designer, and choose Run Query
   to invoke the Graph Wizard.

5. Drag two numeric fields to the Data Series list box and drag a character
   field to the Axis position.

OLE Automation Technique

To use the OLE Automation, issue the following commands in the Command window or
a program file:

      PUBLIC x
      x=CREATEOBJECT('Form')
      x.Show
      x.AddObject('graph1','olecontrol','msgraph.chart')
      * class excel.chart could also be used in the above command
      x.graph1.type=14        && this is the 3-D Surface Graph
      x.graph1.height=150
      x.graph1.width=250
      x.graph1.visible=.t.
