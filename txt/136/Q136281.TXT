PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The "Data Type Mismatch" error message appears when the form starts.

CAUSE
=====

The Grid Builder leaves the original control as the column's CurrentControl
property even though the CurrentControl has changed.

WORKAROUND
==========

Enter the correct CurrentControl manually or through the Grid Builder. Then
delete the incorrect control along with the text box from the column.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.

In Visual FoxPro 5.0, if the order of the fields is changed in step 1, then the
choices for Control Type in step 3 are set back to the default of a text box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
