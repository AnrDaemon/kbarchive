SYMPTOMS
========

In PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0, when you print a presentation, you
may receive the following error message:

   Not enough printer memory available to print page.

You may encounter this error message when you print from either the stand-alone
version of PowerPoint 97 or from Office Binder.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because the memory setting on the Windows 95 printer
driver is too low. The default memory setting for some printer drivers is the
lowest possible setting; this setting may be insufficient for your print job.

RESOLUTION
==========

To fix this problem, reset the memory setting on the printer driver to reflect
the exact amount of memory installed on the printer in question.

To change the printer driver memory setting, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Right-click the appropriate printer icon and then click Properties on the
   menu that appears.

3. Click the Device Options tab.

4. In the Printer Memory list, click the correct setting and then click OK.

REFERENCES
==========

printer, see your printer manufacturer's user guide. For information about
