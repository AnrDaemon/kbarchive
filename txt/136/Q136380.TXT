-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to PROFS, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When a Gateway to PROFS access component is installed on a new Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks postoffice in a PROFS environment, you can create PROFS nodes
and associated lists by using IMPORT.EXE to extract an address list from any
PROFS installation and running the same application against the new installation
with the -c option added to the command line.

NOTE: This same technique can be applied to any supported Mail for PC Networks
gateway that uses DGNs and nodes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Run the following command against any existing PROFS gateway installation:

   import admin -ppassword -d<driveletter> -x -gprofs
   -f<drive>:\<path>\profs.lst

where:

   ADMIN is the administrator account for the source postoffice.
   PASSWORD is the password for that account.
   driveletter points to the mail database of the source postoffice.
   GPROFS declares the gateway type.
   PROFS.LST can be any 8.3 file name.

Now run IMPORT.EXE against the target installation:

   import admin -ppassword -d<driveletter> -f<drive>:\<path>\profs.lst -c

where:

   driveletter refers to the drive letter mapped to the mail database
   of the target postoffice.
   -c to create the node definitions and install the associated address
   list.

To include the newly installed PROFS list into the Global Address List (GAL), run
the following command:

   REBUILD -d<driveletter> -f
