SUMMARY
=======

The "Using Spinners" section in chapter 11 of the Visual FoxPro Developer's
Guide gives the following incorrect information:

   If you want a user to be able to spin through a range of dates, you could
   size the spinner so that only the buttons are visible and position a text box
   beside the spinner buttons.

It is not possible to size a spinner so that only the buttons are visible. The
example in this article shows how to make a Day Date spinner and make it appear
to be a single control.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Create a new class called DayDateSpin based on Container.

2. Store it in MyLib.vcx.

3. Set the following properties for the DayDateSpin container:

   BackStyle = 0 - Transparent
   BorderWidth = 0
   Height = 24
   Width = 164

4. Add a text box to the container, and set these properties:

   FontName = Courier New   && Or any nonproportional font
   FontSize = 9
   Format = k    && Highlights the text box when the focus gets set to it.
   Height = 22
   Left = 0
   ReadOnly = .T. && Keeps the user from editing the text box
   Top = 1
   Width = 148

5. In the Init event procedure of the text box, add this code:

      THIS.Value = PADR(CDOW(DATE()),11) + DTOC(DATE())
      ** This puts current day and date in the text box when the form starts

6. Add a spinner to the container and set these properties:

   FontSize = 1
   Height = 24
   Left = 146
   Top = 0
   Width = 18

7. On the Format menu, click Send to Back

8. Add the following code to the spinner's DownClick event procedure:

      dMyDate = CTOD(RIGHT(ALLTRIM(THIS.PARENT.Text1.Value),8))
      ** Gets the Date from the text box
      dMyDate = dMyDate - 1  && Decrease the date by one
      THIS.PARENT.Text1.Value = PADR(CDOW(dMyDate),11) + DTOC(dMyDate)
      **Stores the new day of the week and date back into the text box
      THIS.PARENT.Text1.SetFocus

9. Add the following code to the spinner's UpClick event procedure:

      dMyDate = CTOD(RIGHT(ALLTRIM(THIS.PARENT.Text1.Value),8))
      ** Gets the Date from the text box
      dMyDate = dMyDate + 1  && Increment the date by one
      THIS.PARENT.Text1.Value = PADR(CDOW(dMyDate),11) + DTOC(dMyDate)
      **Stores the new day of the week and date back into the text box
      THIS.PARENT.Text1.SetFocus

10. Save and close the class.

11. Create a new form. Then click the View Classes Icon on the Form Controls
   toolbar. Click Add, and select MyLib.vcx.

12. Pick the DayDateSpin class from the Form Controls toolbar, and place it on
   the form.

13. Save and run the form. Click the up arrow or down arrow to see the day and
   date go up or down.
