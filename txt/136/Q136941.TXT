The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The choices and settings you make in the Options dialog box (obtained by
clicking Options on the Tools menu) take effect once you click OK. However, most
of them will not be evident until you take some further action. There are just a
few settings that are immediately evident.

MORE INFORMATION
================

International Tab
-----------------

 - All of the Date and Time settings are immediately reflected in an active
   Browse window displaying Date or DateTime type fields.

 - The Decimal Separator character is reflected in any Browse window displaying
   numeric or currency type fields.

 - Selecting the 24 Hour option displays the time in 24-hour format in the Clock
   on the Status Bar if the Status Bar is visible and the Clock is set on.
   However, if you select the 12 Hour option after selecting the 24 Hour option,
   the Clock window resizes to a smaller width, hiding the AM/PM. To correct
   this, open the Options dialog box again and click OK.

Data Tab
--------

 - Selecting or clearing the Ignore Deleted Records option hides or displays
   deleted records in an active Browse window.

View Tab
--------

 - Selecting or clearing the Status Bar option sets the status bar ON or OFF.

 - Selecting or clearing the Clock option displays or removes the clock from the
   Status Bar, if the Status Bar is set on.

General Tab
-----------

 - Selecting the Show Trace Window option opens the Trace window. However,
   clearing it does not close the Trace window. To close the Trace window and
   reset ECHO to OFF, use the Trace window Control menu.

Edit Tab
--------

Several of the choices on the Edit tab are immediately apparent in the edit
window that is open when you select the Options dialog box

 - Word Wrap. Text wraps or unwraps to the current width of the edit window.

 - Automatic Indent. When Word Wrap is selected, paragraphs that begin with a
   Tab adjust as you change this setting.

 - Alignment. Text immediately aligns to the left, center, or right.

 - Tab Width. Both Indents and embedded Tabs adjust to a change in this setting.

 - Show Line/Column Position. This is reflected on the Status Bar if it is
   displayed.
