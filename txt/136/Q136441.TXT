TITLE   :Last Known Good Always Restores Original Boot Settings
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you boot Windows NT and choose to use the Last Known Good configuration,
the original boot settings are restored. Changes that were made during
subsequent successful boots are not used.

CAUSE
=====

Winlogon checks for the value ReportBootOK in the registry. If it is set to 1,
the Service Controller deletes the Clone key. This results in the current boot
settings being saved as Last Known Good.

Current boot settings are not written to the Clone key because Winlogon doesn't
report that the boot was successful, so the Service Controller doesn't delete
the original Clone Key.


RESOLUTION
==========

Upgrade to the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT.

STATUS
======

This problem was corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.
