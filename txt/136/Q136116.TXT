The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use the SMTP Mail Gateway as the backbone between Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks postoffices, the Unix system may try to send the following message to
the POSTMASTER on the gateway postoffice (PO) (if a postmaster mailbox exists on
the gateway PO):

   XXENC User unknown

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Mail for PC Networks postoffices are set up to communicate via SMTP (refer
to Backbone Mail pages 51-58 of the Mail Gateway to SMTP "Administrator's
Guide") messages are addressed to the standard 10/10/10 address as used with
normal Mail messages. These messages are sent to the gateway, then they get
encapsulated and sent to XXENC@ [SMTP alias of the downstream postoffice].

If the SMTP alias of the downstream postoffice (refer to Mapping Microsoft
Addresses to SMTP Addresses pages 34-36 of the Mail Gateway to SMTP
"Administrator's Guide") is set implicitly, this mail message will not get to
the gateway machine and subsequently to the intended postoffice.

The Unix system will try to match the XXENC alias to an entry in its alias table
and will not find a match. Then it will send the system message "XXENC User
Unknown" to the POSTMASTER.

When you set up mappings to Mail postoffices, remember to make the mapping
explicit so the address does not need to be resolved by the Unix system. As a
result, it will get to the intended gateway.
