The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.2a, 3.5

SYMPTOMS
========

When you import a file into a Mail postoffice, you may get the following error
message:

   Fatal error 54 Server name could not be accessed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the -c IMPORT.EXE command line option.

The -c option will try to create new postoffices. However, it needs to know about
an existing Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync) server, and if this has not
been defined, it will give the above error.

A, page 319 for version 3.2 or page 320 for version 3.5 Microsoft Mail for PC
