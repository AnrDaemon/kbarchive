SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Microsoft Office 95 in Windows NT and place the mouse pointer
on the Office 95 Shortcut bar for a long period of time, the following error
message appears:

   System Process - Out of Virtual Memory

   Your system is running low on virtual memory. Please close some applications.
   You can then start the System option in the Control Panel and choose the
   Virtual Memory button to create an additional page file or to increase the
   size of your current paging file.

CAUSE
=====

Each time you use the Microsoft Office Toolbox to open a document or keep the
mouse on the Shortcut the Microsoft Office process does not free used memory
properly.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, stop and restart the toolbar periodically, or
remove it from the startup group and do not leave it running.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
