TITLE   :Active Event Logging Server Becomes Slow, Exhausts Paged Pool
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Your Windows NT computer that is doing a large amount of event logging begins to
run slowly left on long time. PerfMon shows that SERVICES.EXE has a large amount
of private bytes associated with it and paged pool memory resources become
exhausted. Debugging shows there is a problem with the SERVICES.EXE process and
exhaustion of virtual memory.

CAUSE
=====

OpenEventLog, RegisterEventSource, and DeregisterEventSource functions do not
deallocate memory correctly.


RESOLUTION
==========

EVENTLOG.DLL has been modified to the memory deallocation problems in both API
functions.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in the Windows NT version 3.51. A version 3.5 fix to this
problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.
