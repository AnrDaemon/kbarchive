error message appears when you try to load the driver:

RESOLUTION

If you have an account with Cisco, you can connect to CIO.CISCO.COM and download
the latest driver for Windows NT (NT_16.EXE). If you do not have an account,
contact the Cisco technical support office at 1-800-553-2447 for assistance in
downloading the file from the Cisco bulletin board system (BBS). Their BBS

dialing in as an unregistered guest. After you have downloaded NT_16.EXE, type
the following command to expand it:

   NT_16.EXE -d

STATUS
