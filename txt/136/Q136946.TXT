======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The ToolBar, Container, and Control objects do not expose a RighClick event.
These objects should have a RightClick event. Objects that support Click and
DblClick should also have RightClick.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can capture a right mouse click by using the MouseDown event. It occurs when
the user presses any mouse button. The MouseDown event accepts a parameter that
specifies which button was pressed to trigger the event.

For more information about MouseDown, please search for "MouseDown" in the Visual
FoxPro Help file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.
