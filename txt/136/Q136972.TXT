SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using real-mode drivers for a NEC CDR-82 CD-ROM drive, you may
receive the following error message when you try to access the CD-ROM drive from
an MS-DOS prompt within Windows 95 if the real-mode drivers are not loaded into
upper memory:

   CDR103: CDROM not High Sierra or ISO-9660 format reading from drive
   <x>:

If you try to access the CD-ROM drive from Windows Explorer or My Computer, the
drive appears, but you cannot see any files on the drive.

Note that this problem does not occur if you boot your computer to a command
prompt and then access the drive.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, modify the appropriate lines in the Config.sys and
Autoexec.bat files so that the real-mode CD-ROM driver and Mscdex.exe are loaded
into upper memory. For information about how to do so, consult the CD-ROM
drive's documentation, or contact the manufacturer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
