SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the type of file caching that Visual FoxPro performs on
tables.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual FoxPro performs read and write caching on tables opened exclusively. To
flush the write buffers, use the FLUSH command. The write buffers are also
automatically flushed periodically.

Visual FoxPro performs read-only caching on tables opened in shared mode. The
update on the read cache is based on the second parameter of SET REFRESH.

Visual FoxPro performs its own file caching, so you should limit the amount of
memory given to file-caching software such as SMARTDRV to approximately 256K.
This gives more memory to Visual FoxPro, and Visual FoxPro can manage it more
efficiently than SMARTDRV can because Visual FoxPro has more knowledge of its
own disk access patterns.
