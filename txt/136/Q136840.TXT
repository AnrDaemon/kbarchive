SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft QuickShelf from within Microsoft Word or WordPerfect
version 6.x for Windows, a macro or menu command assigned to the CTRL+C key
combination runs. This occurs even though the QuickShelf keys are all set to
None and the Enable QuickShelf Keys box is cleared.

NOTE: The problem does not occur with Microsoft Windows Write and Microsoft
Recorder from Windows 3.x Recorder.


RESOLUTION
==========

Do not use the CTRL+C key combination in the macro.

MORE INFORMATION
================

graphics. The CTRL+C key combination was chosen as a QuickShelf command to copy
text from an application into the Bookshelf 1995 CD application.
