SUMMARY
=======

A simple Message Application Programming Interface (MAPI) application allows
users to access messaging services, such as Mail for PC Networks. However, in
order to access Mail for PC Networks on a system that does not have Microsoft
Mail for Windows installed, you must place the files listed below, the
executable file, and the run time files onto the system so that the application
can be launched.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In a typical setting, the files needed are:

In the <WINDIR>/SYSTEM directory:

   AB.DLL
   DEMILAYR.DLL
   FRAMEWRK.DLL
   MAPI.DLL
   MSSFS.DLL
   MAILMGR.DLL
   MAILSPL.EXE
   PABNSP.DLL
   STORE.DLL
   VFORMS.DLL

In the <WINDIR> directory:

   MSMAIL.INI

NOTE: If the application uses objects that make calls to MAPI.DLL and not to
MAPI.DLL directly, the object files must be placed on the system as well; for
example, MSMAPI.VBX.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.20 1.00 Visual Basic C++
