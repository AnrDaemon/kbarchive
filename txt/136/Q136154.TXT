SYMPTOMS
========

When the Format property of a text box residing on a form is set to M, the
DblClick event is not executed when the form is run. Setting the Format property
to M allows for multiple preset input masks to be used in the text box.

For more information on this setting, please see the "Format Property" topic in
the Visual FoxPro Help file.

WORKAROUND
==========

Execute the code during a Click event, or use a combo box in place of the text
box.

the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
