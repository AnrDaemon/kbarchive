The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

This article shows the general firing sequence of Visual FoxPro events. For more
information, please search for the "Visual FoxPro Event Sequence" topic in the
Visual FoxPro Help file.

There can be an infinite number of potential user interaction scenarios that will
generate specific event sequences. An easy way to observe the order is to
include the following lines of code in the events you are interested in:

      ACTIVATE SCREEN
      ? PROGRAM()

MORE INFORMATION
================

For a description of event sequences in a simple user interaction scenario,
please see Chapter 4 of the Visual FoxPro "Developer's Guide." For a detailed
look at Visual FoxPro event sequences, run Controls.app from the
Vfp\Samples\Controls directory, select "See Event Firing Sequences" in the
Examples list, and choose Run Example.

The data environment's AutoOpenTables property is assumed to be set to true
(.T.). Other events can occur based on user interaction and system response.
