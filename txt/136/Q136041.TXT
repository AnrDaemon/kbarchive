KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may get the following error message when your connection to the postoffice
is lost:

   This device does not exist on the network. reading drive M Abort, Retry Fail?

CAUSE
=====

Network problems can cause an unstable connection to the postoffice and generate
the above error.

RESOLUTION
==========

The gateway will continue to process when you enter A, R, or F (abort, retry, or
fail, respectively). Once the drive connection is re-established, the gateway
will function again if you select retry.

You can eliminate having to enter A, R, or F by running SMTPGATE.EXE in an
instance of COMMAND.COM with the following option:

   c:\dos\command.com /f

The /f option on COMMAND.COM causes an automatic fail on INT 24. In this case,
the gateway will be able to continue processing once the connection is
re-established without you manually entering a command.
