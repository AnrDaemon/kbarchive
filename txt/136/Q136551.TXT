RESOLUTION

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Windows 95, you can specify a keyboard preference option that informs
programs that you prefer to use the keyboard rather than the mouse. Programs
written to support this feature change their appearance to graphically display
keyboard-related items.

The Use ShowSounds option instructs programs that normally convey information
only with sounds to also provide information visually, such as by displaying
text captions or informative icons.
