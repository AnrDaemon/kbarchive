TITLE   :PRB: "Record Not Available" When Opening a Table Shared
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under Windows for Workgroups, when a table is opened for SHARED use, the
scrolling message "Record Not Available" is displayed in the status bar. This
error also occurs when the Wizard that uses a .VCX file, such as Form Wizard, is
started.

CAUSE
=====

Sharing data is not allowed because neither VSHARE nor SHARE.EXE are loaded. By
default, Visual FoxPro 3.0 uses VSHARE.386. If it is not loaded, the Visual
FoxPro Setup program adds the following line to the [386Enh] section of the
SYSTEM.INI:

      Device=VSHARE.386

RESOLUTION
==========

Ensure that either SHARE or VSHARE are loaded. For more information about
loading SHARE.EXE, please see page 64 of the Visual FoxPro 3.0 Installation
Guide, Sharing Tables in a Multiuser Environment.

If you are using Novell DOS 7, you need to load SHARE because VSHARE support is
built into SHARE.EXE. Refer to your Novell documentation for more information.
Also, the VFP.EXE file needs to be marked read only.


STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
