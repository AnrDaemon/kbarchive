The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

If you use Windows NT Remote Access Service (RAS) and a Megahertz modem, you can
obtain a software support release from Megahertz Corporation that contains a new
MODEM.INF file with updated drivers for all Windows NT supported Megahertz
modems. This release also contains a README.TXT file that covers several topics,
for example:

 - The new MODEM.INF file also supports the Megahertz XJ2288/CC3288 modems.

 - RAS modem auto-detection may not work with certain modem revisions.

To obtain the release, connect to CompuServe and download RASMODNT.EXE from the
Megahertz (9) file library in the Modem Vendor Forum (GO MODEMVENDOR). For
additional information, contact Megahertz Technical Support at (801) 320-7777.

NOTE: Although your modem operates correctly under Windows Terminal or another
terminal program, if you configure your modem for the wrong modem driver in RAS
or if you have a modem model that received a new BIOS revision or chip set since
the creation of the RAS modem driver, the following error message appears when
you dial a RAS server:

   Error 652 Unrecognized Response From Device


To correct this problem, try one or more of the following:

 - Configure your modem for the correct or compatible modem model in RAS.

 - Contact the modem manufacturer for an updated MODEM.INF section, if the
   RASMODNT.EXE did not correct the problem.

 - Customize the existing MODEM.INF section for your modem to comply with the
   new BIOS chip set.

 - Create a new MODEM.INF section for your modem at the end of the MODEM.INF
   file
