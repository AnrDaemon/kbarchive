After you install Windows 95, you may see the following error message on a blue
screen the first time the computer restarts:

   Windows: A fatal error 0D has occurred at 0028:xxxxxxxx in VXD VMCPD(01) +

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Restart your computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, press
   the F8 key, and then choose Safe Mode from the Startup menu.

2. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

3. Double-click the System icon.

5. Click Numeric Data Processor, and then click Properties.

   box to select it, and then click OK.
