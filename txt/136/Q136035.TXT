WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Back up all Mail message files (*.MMF) and Schedule Plus (*.CAL) files.

2. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).
