TITLE   :BUG: SHOW WINDOW <name> REFRESH in BROWSE VALID Does Not Work
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp500bugkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using a BROWSE command that contains a VALID clause to refresh the browse upon
changing the value in an indexed field does not work.

WORKAROUND
==========

The user-defined function or procedure referenced in the VALID clause can force
a refresh by following these steps in this order:

1. Refresh the title of the window.

2. Refresh the name of the window.

3. Refresh the title of the window a second time.

To demonstrate this workaround, modify the 'freshen' procedure in the code listed
in the "More Information" section of this article to this:

      PROCEDURE freshen
         SHOW WINDOW customer REFRESH
         SHOW WINDOW vfpbrows REFRESH
         SHOW WINDOW customer REFRESH

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

Using the Customer.dbf table that ships with Visual FoxPro, create and run a
program that contains this code:

      USE C:\VFP\SAMPLES\DATA\customer.dbf
      SET ORDER TO TAG company
      DEFINE WINDOW vfpbrows FROM 0,0 TO 24,79
      MOVE WINDOW vfpbrows CENTER
      BROWSE FIELDS company :V=freshen(), contact WINDOW vfpbrows
      CLOSE ALL
      RELEASE WINDOW vfpbrows

      PROCEDURE freshen
         SHOW WINDOW customer REFRESH

With this code, you'd expect that making a change to the Company field would
cause the record to assume its new position in the index upon exiting that
field. However, that occurs only when a change is made to the first record in
the file.

NOTE: In this code, the title of a browse takes on the name of the table that is
being browsed. If a title is applied with a title clause in the DEFINE WINDOW
line, then that title should be referenced in the SHOW WINDOW line of the
'freshen' procedure.
