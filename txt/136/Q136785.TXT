======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft Schedule+ version 7.0 user sends a meeting request to another
Schedule+ 7.0 user, that user can send attachments along with the meeting
request. However, when the recipient opens the meeting request and accepts,
there is no indication within Schedule+ that an attachment is associated with
the meeting.

RESOLUTION
==========

When the recipient views the original meeting request from the Microsoft
Exchange client, the attachment will be present.

To make meeting request recipients aware of the presence of an attachment, the
originator of the meeting request can include a reference in the Description
field or the Notes tab.


Additional query words: 7.00 schedule plus
