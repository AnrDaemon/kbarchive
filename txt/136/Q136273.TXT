SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a computer with a SCSI host adapter and an early version of
the NEC 4X CD-ROM drive, Windows 95 may stop responding (hang) approximately two
minutes after you remove a CD-ROM from the drive.

CAUSE
=====

Early versions of the NEC 4X CD-ROM drive have a problem with synchronous data
transfer on some SCSI host adapters. This problem may also occur with some NEC
3Xi and 3Xe CD-ROM drives.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the System icon.

2. On the Device Manager tab, double-click the CD-ROM branch.

3. Double-click the CD-ROM drive you want to reconfigure.

4. On the Settings tab, click the Auto Insert Notification and Sync Data
   Transfer check boxes to clear them.

5. Click OK until you return to Control Panel.

6. If the problem persists, try disabling synchronous data transfer on the SCSI
   host adapter.

   For information about disabling synchronous data transfer on the SCSI host
   adapter, please consult the documentation included with the adapter.

7. If these steps do not succeed in resolving the problem, you may want to
   contact NEC to inquire about obtaining a firmware upgrade for the drive.
