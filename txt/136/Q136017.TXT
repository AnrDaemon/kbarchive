TITLE   :PRB: Cannot Update Cursor Error Occurs as Buildapp Builds .EXE
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:3.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Buildapp.prg is used to build an .exe file, the following error may occur:

   Cannot update the cursor. Method: build Line: 9 BUILD EXE (this.cAPPFile)
   FROM (this.cProjectFile)

CAUSE
=====

The application name parameter passed to Buildapp included an .app extension.

RESOLUTION
==========

If Buildapp is being used to build an .exe file, the application name parameter
should either have no extension or have an .exe extension.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Located in the Visual FoxPro Tools\Buildapp directory, Buildapp.prg strips the
method and event code of .scx and .vcx files from .app and .exe files for
distribution purposes.

In Visual FoxPro, source code is usually stored in the Methods field of all .scx
and .vcx tables. When you build an application, these fields are included in the
build, and the code is included in the .app file. Buildapp strips the code from
the methods field before the final application build and restores files to their
original state following the build. By building files without source code, your
.app files are smaller and more secure. The syntax is:

   DO BUILDAPP WITH cProjectName, cAppFileName, lDebugMode, lBuildEXE

The cAppFileName parameter should either have no extension or reflect the
extension of the type of file you are building (.app for application, or .exe
for executable). In the process of building an executable, FoxPro builds a
temporary .app file with the name you specified in the cAppFileName parameter.
This will cause a problem in the next step when it tries to create an executable
file with a .app extension from the temporary .app file it has already created.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

The following example uses the Tastrade.pjx file in the Samples\Mainsamp
directory under the Visual FoxPro directory.

Issue the following commands in the Command window:

      SET DEFAULT TO SYS(2004)+'SAMPLES\MAINSAMP'

      DO SYS(2004)+'TOOLS\BUILDAPP\BUILDAPP.PRG' ;
         WITH "tastrade.pjx", "tastrade.app", .F., .T.

At this point, the error occurs. To prevent the error, use one of the following
commands to build the executable:

      DO SYS(2004)+'TOOLS\BUILDAPP\BUILDAPP.PRG' ;
         WITH "tastrade.pjx", "tastrade", .F., .T.

   -or-

      DO SYS(2004)+'TOOLS\BUILDAPP\BUILDAPP.PRG' ;
         WITH "tastrade.pjx", "tastrade.exe", .F., .T.
