TITLE   :Windows 95 Does Not Detect AMI Fast SCSI II Controller
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows 95 does not detect an AMI Fast SCSI II controller in your computer.
Instead, it installs a Buslogic driver.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 does not include an AMI SCSI controller driver. The AMI Fast SCSI
Series 7000 chip set on these controllers is backward compatible with Buslogic
and Adaptec controllers. However, using either of these drivers may cause the
floppy disk drive(s) not to work.

RESOLUTION
==========

You may be able to use the Microsoft Windows NT driver for the AMI Fast SCSI
controller. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Obtain the Windows NT driver for the controller from AMI's BBS. The driver
   file is currently named Ami0nt.sys.

2. Rename this file to Buslogic.mpd or Aha154x.mpd.

3. Copy the file to the Windows\System\Iosubsys folder.

4. Refer to the controller's documentation for further information about setting
   up the Windows NT driver for the controller.
