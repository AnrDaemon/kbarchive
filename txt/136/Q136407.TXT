KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Accton MPX EN1652 NE2000-compatible network adapter in your computer may not
be detected by Setup or the Add New Hardware Wizard.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the network adapter is configured to use one of the
following base I/O addresses:

 - 240

 - 280

 - 2C0

Although these are valid settings for the network adapter, Windows 95 does not
query these addresses when it searches for NE2000-compatible network adapters.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

 - Manually install the Accton MPX EN1652 network adapter as an NE2000-
   compatible network adapter by following these steps:

   1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

   2. Double-click the Add New Hardware icon, and then click Next.

   3. Click the No option button, and then click Next.

   4. Double-click Network Adapters.

   5. In the Manufacturers box, click Novell/Anthem. In the Models box, click
      NE2000 Compatible.

   6. Click OK, and then click Next.

 - Use the configuration utility included with the network adapter to configure
   it to use one of the following valid base I/O addresses:

    - 300
    - 320
    - 340
    - 360

   After you configure the network adapter to use one of these base I/O
   addressed, run the Add New Hardware Wizard to install the network adapter.
