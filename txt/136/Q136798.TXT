found on the CD-ROM disc for Visual C++ versions 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2. Note that
some of these DLLs are not found on all versions of Visual C++, but all of the
following descriptions are correct:

 - \Msvc20\Redist\Ctl3d32.dll is the UNICODE version of Ctl3d32.dll to be
   installed in Windows NT for your application. In Visual C++ versions 2.0 and
   2.1, this DLL is also needed by ODBC.
