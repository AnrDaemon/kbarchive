In response to customer feedback, Microsoft is releasing updates to several of
the Visual FoxPro version 3.0 Wizards. These updates contain both improvements
and minor enhancements. We are releasing new versions of the Form, Query, Graph,
Cross-Tab, and PivotTable Wizards. Here are the changes:

 - Form Wizard: Restructured style classes can be subclassed off of common base
   classes. These classes can now be used in form sets and page frames. Internal
   modifications were made to accommodate the new open architecture for adding
   custom styles.

 - PivotTable Wizard: Resolved some compatibility issues with Microsoft Excel 95
   and Microsoft Query 2.0.

 - Cross-Tab Wizard: Added a new Shownulls property that controls the display of
   nulls in the resulting cross-tab.

 - Graph and Query Wizards: Provides better support for handling Local and
   Remote Views.

Place the following files in the Wizards subdirectory of the Visual FoxPro root
directory:

   Wzform.app
   Wzquery.app
   Wzpivot.app
   Wzgraph.app
   Wizstyle.vcx
   Wizstyle.vct

Place the following file in your Visual FoxPro root directory or where it can be
referenced by the _GENXTAB global variable:

   Vfpxtab.prg
