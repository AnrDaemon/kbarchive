The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

On page 169 of the Professional Features Guide, the "To change the default
application icon" section gives the following incorrect information:

   In Step 7 of the Setup Wizard, choose the Icon button for your application
   and specify the icon file.

Step 7 of the Setup Wizard actually indicates the Setup Wizard is finished. There
is no place to pick an icon.

This documentation error has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step 6 of the Setup Wizard allows you to associate an icon with an application.

For more information about using the Setup Wizard, please see chapter 10 of the
Professional Features Guide, or see the following article in the Microsoft
