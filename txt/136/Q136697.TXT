SUMMARY
=======

Page breaks provide a way to organize your report into separate sections. You
can create page breaks in a report by grouping the data. Once this is done, page
breaks can be added at the end of each group. Page numbering can either continue
or be reset each time a group changes. There is virtually no limit to the number
of groups you can add to your report.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In design mode, you can gain access to the grouping dialog box in two ways, by
using the menu or by clicking the right mouse button (right-click). The grouping
dialog box has a check box that allows you to introduce page breaks after each
group. Each grouping level of the report has this capability.

For example, the Order report in the TasTrade database is grouped on order
number. The option to start a new page when the group changes means that each
order is printed on a separate sheet.

For more information on how to set up grouping levels, please see the Visual
FoxPro "User's Guide," Reports and Labels, Part 4, Chapter 9, page 161.
