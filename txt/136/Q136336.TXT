TITLE   :Windows NT Fails Because of an Access Violation in WINLOGON
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If an access violation occurs in WINLOGON, an updated DrWtsn32.LOG appears in
the %SystemRoot directory and the following symptoms also occur sporadically:

 - A STOP 21a message appears on the server screen.

 - The error message "Error 1723 RPC Server too Busy" is returned to client
   requests.

CAUSE
=====

Winlogon fails due to an access violation caused by an RPC length pointer that
refers beyond the end of a data structure (RPC buffer) referenced during RPC
unmarshalling. This occurs if a client program provides an invalid RPC packet
length or the length field gets damaged during the delivery to the server
process.

The STOP 21a message occurs if the security system fails.

The Error 1723 occurs if threads in the SERVICES.EXE block as a result of the
security system failure.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.


STATUS
======

problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
