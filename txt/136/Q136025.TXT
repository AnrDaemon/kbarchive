SUMMARY
=======

You can use the Class Browser to copy objects from one class library to another
by using the drag and drop feature.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A typical drag and drop interface allows you to move or copy an object by
dragging it from one editing region to another. However, the Class Browser
included with Visual FoxPro requires that you first select the object to be
moved or copied, and then drag an icon that appears above the editing region
from one instance of the Class Browser to another. The following procedure
describes how to move an object from one class to another.

1. Open or switch to Visual FoxPro, and launch two instances of the Class
   Browser. The first instance should be looking at the source class (the class
   containing the object to be copied) and the second should be looking at the
   destination class (the class into which the object is to be placed).

2. Select the object in the source class that you want to copy. Note that upon
   selection, an icon appears above the edit region (or class list) that
   represents the selected object.

3. Drag the icon into the region between the toolbar and the edit region (class
   list) of the instance of the Class Browser containing the target class. This
   will cause the selected object to be copied.

NOTE: You may also copy entire library files from one project to another using
drag and drop functionality between project windows.
