PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The KeyPreview property of a form is used to determine whether or not the form
will receive the KeyPress events of a control on the form. If this property is
set to true, the form will receive the KeyPress events, if it is false, the form
won't receive the KeyPress events. This behavior is consistent for all keyboard
keys except those that cause a shift in focus within the form, such as the TAB
key.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form, and place two text boxes on it.

2. Set the KeyPreview property of the form to false (.F.).

3. Place the following code in the form's KeyPress event procedure:

      =MessageBox("This is the KeyPress of the Form")

4. Place the following code in the first text box KeyPress event procedure:

      =MessageBox("This is the KeyPress of the textbox")

5. Run the form, and press a key. The message box for the text box is the only
   one that appears because the KeyPreview property is set to false.

6. Run the form again, and press the TAB key. This time the message box for the
   text box appears followed by the message box for the form.
