SUMMARY
=======

This article shows by example how to change the mouse pointer when the mouse is
over an object on a form.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can change the mouse pointer to to a different shape such as an hourglass,
cross-hair, or I-beam to indicate that something has occurred or to inform the
user that an action is occurring. To change the mouse pointer in Visual FoxPro,
use the MousePointer property of an object.

When the mouse pointer is over a particular object, change that object's
MousePointer property to change the mouse pointer into a special pointer shape.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

This example changes the mouse pointer into a cross-hair when it is over a text
box.

1. Create a new form.

2. Place a text box object on the form.

3. With the text box object selected, click the Layout tab of the Property
   Sheet.

4. Change the MousePointer property to 2 - Cross.

5. Save and run the form.

6. Move the mouse over the text box and notice the mouse pointer change to a
   cross-hair.
