TITLE   :Display Applet Does Not Disable Drivers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you change your Windows NT display driver, this message appears:

   At least one service or driver failed during system startup. Use Event Viewer
   to examine the event log for details.

The event log says that this message is caused by the driver of your old display
adapter or another display you have installed.

CAUSE
=====

When you install a new display driver, the display applet disables the old
driver if the Disable current driver check box is selected. One of the following
causes may not allow a driver to identify the new graphics adapter.

 - You first installed the wrong display driver and then the correct one.

 - You changed your graphics adapter and booted with an entry from BOOT.INI
   which resets the display to /BASEVIDEO.

 - You changed your graphics adapter and booted normally. Your computer reverted
   to standard VGA when the previously used driver did not find the old graphics
   adapter.

The applet disables only the currently used driver. It does not disable any
previous drivers that have been installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Disable the driver manually. Do this with the Deinstall button in the Display
Applet or by changing the startup value for the driver you want to disable in
the Devices Applet.

NOTE: The Deinstall button does not actually delete the driver files. It only
disables the driver in the registry.
