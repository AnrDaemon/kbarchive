The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Developer's Guide, Chapter 2, "Overview of the language," under For Clauses,
on page 46 gives the following incorrect information:

   The following example stores low balance in the alert field of all records
   that contain less than 500 in the total field.

   REPLACE alert WITH "low balance" FOR total < 500

This documentation error has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The REPLACE command needs the ALL scope, so that the line of code reads:

      REPLACE ALL alert WITH "low balance" FOR total < 500

Additional query words: docerr VFoxWin 5.00
