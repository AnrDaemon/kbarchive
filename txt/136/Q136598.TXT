TITLE   :PC Ext: Cannot Initiate Connection to External Asynchronous PO
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0a,3.2,3.2a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0a, 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure and run the EXTERNAL.EXE program to connect postoffices via
asynchronous communication, the session can only successfully be initialized by
either the sending or receiving end, not both.

CAUSE
=====

The postoffice (PO) on the receiving end of the connection has a corrupt or zero
(0) byte FLAG.GLB.

FLAG.GLB is a static file that should be 2 bytes in size.

RESOLUTION
==========

Copy the FLAG.GLB from a postoffice that is working. If another postoffice is
not available, install a "dummy" postoffice to a local drive, and copy the file
to the \MAILDATA\GLB directory on the problem postoffice.

MORE INFORMATION
================

FLAG.GLB is used to lock other External Mail programs from connecting to the
postoffice.

This problem will also occur when you use version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
Multitasking MTA.
