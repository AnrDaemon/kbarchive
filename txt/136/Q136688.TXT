KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, Professional Edition, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Maximizing the Visual Class Designer and then starting it again from the Class
Browser produces multiple Control boxes and Restore buttons.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Visual Class Designer is invoked from the Class Browser when you double-
click a class name. If you maximize the Class Designer window, switch back to
the Class Browser, and open the Visual Class Designer with another class, the
second window is maximized as well. However, the Microsoft Visual FoxPro window
will have two Visual Class Designer Control boxes and two Restore buttons.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Open a .vcx file and double-click a class.

2. Maximize the Class Designer window, and switch back to the Class Browser.

3. Double-click the same class, or another one. Multiple control boxes and
   Restore buttons (and Close buttons under Windows 95) appear.
