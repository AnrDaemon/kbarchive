SUMMARY
=======

The "Refreshing a One-To-Many Display Based on a List Value" Help file topic is
incomplete. The directions given work correctly if the many display is a grid
but cause sporadic behavior or errors if the many display is a list box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a list box is used for the child (many) display, upon making a selection from
the parent (one), the list box will not reflect the child (many) records unless
it gets the focus. To give the list box the focus, you need to click it with the
mouse or press the TAB key to move to it.

Once the list box has received the initial focus, any subsequent parent
selections cause the list box to display the appropriate child records.

If a "ThisForm.Refresh" is added to the parent object InterActive Change method,
a "Record is Out of Range" error occurs after making a few parent object
selections.

To have the child object behave correctly, the second list box must be requeried
in order to properly display the new information.

In Step 5 of the Help topic, after the REQUERY command, add this line:

      ThisForm.{ListBox2 name}.Requery
