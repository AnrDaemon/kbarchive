TITLE   :NetBIOS Datagrams Sent to Group Names Are Not Broadcast
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

NetBIOS applications that send datagrams to group names may fail to work
correctly with the TCPIP-32 version 3.11b release.

CAUSE
=====

When a NetBIOS application sends a datagram to a group name over the TCP/IP
protocol stack, it is normally sent to a broadcast address. In version 3.11b of
the TCPIP-32 stack, datagrams sent to group names are sent to a specific host
address rather than a broadcast address.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in TCP/IP-32 for Windows for A
supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-tested and should be
applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are
severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the service pack release containing this fix. Contact Microsoft Product
Support Services for more information. Microsoft does not recommend implementing
this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more
information on the availability of this fix.
