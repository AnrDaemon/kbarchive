SYMPTOMS
========

When you use computers running Windows NT as routers between media of different
types, file transfers may start out slowly.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51 TCP/IP uses PMTU (Path Maximum Transfer Unit) discovery
to determine the optimum TCP segment size that can be used for data transfers on
a path between two computers. PMTU discovery is described in RFC1191. Following
is an excerpt from that RFC:

   Router specification

   When a router is unable to forward a datagram because it exceeds the MTU of
   the next-hop network and its Don't Fragment bit is set, the router is
   required to return an ICMP Destination Unreachable message to the source of
   the datagram, with the Code indicating "fragmentation needed and DF set". To
   support the Path MTU Discovery technique specified in this memo, the router
   MUST include the MTU of that next-hop network in the low-order 16 bits of the
   ICMP header field that is labeled "unused" in the ICMP specification [7]. The
   high-order 16 bits remain unused, and MUST be set to zero. Thus, the message
   has the following format:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |   Type = 3    |   Code = 4    |           Checksum            |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |           unused = 0          |         Next-Hop MTU          |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |      Internet Header + 64 bits of Original Datagram Data      |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

When a computer running Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51 is used as a router, it does
return the ICMP Destination Unreachable message; however it does not include the
MTU of the next-hop network. This forces the sending computer to retransmit the
data, guessing at the next-hop MTU. Because it can take several guesses to
determine the correct value, a small delay can occur.

The following trace, captured by Microsoft Network Monitor, illustrates this
behavior:

#  Source Dest   Prot Description

1  server client TCP  ....S., len: 4, seq:1286279, ack:0, win: 8192,
2  client server TCP  .A..S., len: 4, seq:659688, ack:1286280, win: 8760

14 client server FTP  Data Transfer To Server, Port = 1028, size 468

15 client server FTP  Data Transfer To Server, Port = 1028, size 468
--------------------------------------------------------------------

 - The first three frames show the 3-way handshake to set up the connection.

 - The fourth frame shows an attempt to send a 1460 byte TCP segment over the
   path (through a Windows NT 3.51 router).

 - The fifth frame shows the Windows NT 3.51 router returning an ICMP error,
   destination unreachable (fragmentation needed, but DF bit set)

 - The seventh frame shows the client trying a 966 byte segment. This is the
   next "likely" MSS (Maximum Segment Size) down from 1460.

 - The eighth frame is another ICMP destination unreachable message.

 - The ninth frame shows the client trying a 468 byte segment. This succeeds,
   and the transfer continues using that value.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, upgrade to Windows NT 3.51 (if you have not already
done so) and install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.51 or
Windows NT 4.0

The ICMP code for Windows NT 3.51 and Windows NT 4.0 has been modified to include
the Next-Hop MTU correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5 and 3.51.
This problem has been corrected in Windows NT 4.0 and the latest U.S. Service
Pack for Windows NT version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
