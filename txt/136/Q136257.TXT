Item ID  Filename        Description
-------  --------        -----------

S15530   GMMFSRC.EXE     Add Growable Memory-Mapped Files to Your App
                         with Our Exclusive GMMF API. Memory-mapped
                         files are cool-you can make an entire file
                         appear to be in RAM, allowing you to
                         manipulate its contents without any file I/O.
                         However, growing the size of your MMF on the
                         fly is a major pain, unless you take advantage
                         of our new GMMF API. By Jeffrey Richter

                         4.0 adds many facilities that make it easy to
                         exploit new 32-bit technologies. It is 32-bit
                         click-and-go enabled; can create in-proc,
                         local, and remote OLE servers; transparently
                         supports RPC; and supports the new Windows 95
                         controls. By Joshua Trupin.
