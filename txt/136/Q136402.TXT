TITLE   :IniFileMapping for 16-Bit Windows Apps Fail in Windows NT 3.51
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you add a new key to map Windows 16-bit .INI files to user specific entries
in the Microsoft Windows NT Registry using the Software\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\IniFileMapping key, then mappings have no effect. Mappings
created with previous versions of Windows NT do not work either.


CAUSE
=====

IniFileMapping does not work if the application calls the Windows Kernel API
function GetPrivateProfileString with a fully qualified pathname (for example,
C:\PROGHRAMS\MYAPP\MYAPP.INI).

This functionality changed in Windows NT 3.51 because applications failed if they
tried to call GetPrivateProfileString with a fully qualified pathname because
they got their information from the Windows 3.1 WIN.INI entries. The fix
mentioned below treats references to WIN.INI as a special case. If WIN.INI is
referenced, the standard WIN.INI file is be used.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
