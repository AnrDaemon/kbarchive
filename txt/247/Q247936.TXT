TITLE   :XWEB: Error Message Accessing OWA:  HTTP 404 Not Found
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Packs 1, 2, 3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when you use a browser to attempt to
access the Outlook Web Access (OWA) logon screen by typing the URL in the
following format:

   "http://<server FQDN>/exchange" (without the quotation marks)

The error message is as follows:

   HTTP 404 Not Found

If you use the following format, however, you can log on:

   "http://<localhost>/Exchange " (without the quotation marks)

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may occur if the IP address of the OWA computer has been assigned
to a Web site other than the default Web site. Remote OWA clients are
incorrectly directed when they try to find the Exchange virtual root.

RESOLUTION
==========

In Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) Manager, open the properties on
the default Web site, and in the IP Address list, click the IP address of this
server. You will receive the message "Duplicate name exists" if this IP address
has been assigned to another Web site. You will need to set that Web site's
address to (All Unassigned), and then set the default Web site to the IP
address. After you stop and restart the default Web site, attempt to use OWA
again.
