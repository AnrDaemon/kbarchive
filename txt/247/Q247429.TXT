The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start SNA Server Manager remotely from a computer in a non-trusted
domain, SNA Server Manager starts with the following error message:

   Unable to open the Primary SNA Server configuration file. Okay to attempt
   opening a backup SNA Server in Read-only mode?

In the Application event log, event ID 705 is posted with the following
information:

   Source: SNA Base Service
   Description: Logon Failed.
   Explanation: Connection request failed due to data security. Access denied
   ---Error Code : 43

CAUSE
=====

The problem is caused by a user ID or password mismatch between the non-trusted
domain computer and the primary SNA Server computer's local account.

RESOLUTION
==========

One solution is to create a trust relationship and add the remote user account
to the primary SNA Server computer's local administrators group. Another
solution is to add the user ID and password from the non-trusted domain to the
primary SNA Server computer's local administrators group.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SNA Server configuration file (Com.cfg) is located on the primary SNA Server
computer in the SNA\System\Config directory. By default, the Com.cfg file is
managed by the primary SNA Server computer's local administrators group. (This
can be reconfigured in the SNA Server Manager Subdomain properties by selecting
Permissions on the Security tab.)

In order for a non-trusted domain user to be able to remotely run SNA Server
Manager, the login user ID and password must be added to the local
administrators group on the primary SNA Server computer. Then the credentials
are validated through Windows NT Server Pass-through authentication.
