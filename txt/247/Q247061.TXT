TITLE   :XWEB: Computer Running IIS Prompts to Insert Disk in Drive A
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Microsoft Internet Information Service (IIS), a dialog box may be
displayed on the computer running IIS that prompts you to insert a disk in drive
A. The computer running IIS stops responding until you click Ignore.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) only parses the directory name from a full
path string by using a backward slash (\). If a user attaches a file that is
wrong, for example, A:/Test.txt, OWA still uses "A:/Test.txt" as the file name
(without the path). The global ErrorMode variable is generally set to
"SEM_FAILCRITICALERRORS" in the Inetinfo.exe file, so any further processing of
the file stops immediately and an error message is generated. However, if the
ErrorMode variable is changed, some processes, such as CreateFile, do not stop
responding, but they generate a prompt to insert a disk in drive A. Some
dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), such as the Mapi32.dll file, actually temporarily
change the ErrorMode variable. This problem can occur in a high-stress
environment.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

   http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Outlook Web Access

+--------------------------+
| File name  | Version     | 
+--------------------------+
| Attach.inc | 5.5.2651.59 | 
+--------------------------+



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The code in the Attach.inc file is changed so that it parses the path by using
either a backward slash (\), a colon (:), or a forward slash (/), so that such
invalid characters are not parsed into file names.
