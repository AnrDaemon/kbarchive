TITLE   :XADM: Proxy Address Number Mismatch with Exchange 5.5 and ADC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you create two identical user entries within different Recipients
containers in Exchange Server 5.5, the users are assigned e-mail proxy addresses
that are numbered sequentially starting with 2. For example:

   Jane Doe is given an SMTP address of jdoe@test.microsoft.com

   The second Jane Doe is then given an SMTP address of jdoe2@test.microsoft.com

When you use the Microsoft Active Directory Connector (ADC) to synchronize the
Exchange Server 5.5 directory with Microsoft Windows 2000 Active Directory,
these entries have display names within Windows 2000 that are numbered
sequentially starting with 1. For example:

   The first Jane Doe has a display name of Jane Doe

   The second Jane Doe has a display name of Jane Doe-1

This causes an inconsistency with the display names of users and their actual
proxy e-mail addresses.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5
and Microsoft Active Directory Connector.
