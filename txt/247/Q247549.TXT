======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 
 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 Professional Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you fly in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000, you do not land automatically
when you press the X key.

In addition, when you configure your controls in Flight Simulator 2000, the Land
Me command is not in the list of commands that you can assign to a control.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. The Land Me command in Microsoft Flight Simulator 98
no longer exists in Flight Simulator 2000.

Additional query words: flightsim fsim msgame landme fs fs2k
