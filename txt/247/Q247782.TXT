SYMPTOMS
========

When you administer Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5, you may notice that mail
transfer across connectors is extremely slow. Event Viewer may record the
following events in the application log:

   Event ID: 3120
   Source: MSExchangeMTA
   Type: Warning
   Description: A resource limit has been reached when attempting to open an
   association. Number of sessions configured: 30

   Event ID: 9316
   Source: MSExchangeMTA
   Type: Warning
   Description: An RPC communications error occurred. No data was sent over the
   RPC connection. Locality table (LTAB) index: x. Windows NT error: 9317.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the Message Transfer Agent (MTA) experiences a
resource shortage.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this behavior, change the 'Concurrent XAPI sessions' value in the
registry:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA\Parameters\ 

3. Double-click the Concurrent XAPI Sessions value.

4. In the Radix area click Hex, in the Data box type "50" (without the quotation
   marks), and then click OK.

NOTE: By default this value is set to 50 hex (80 decimal). If Performance
Optimizer is run with default settings selected, the value will be set to 30.

5. Quit Registry Editor.
