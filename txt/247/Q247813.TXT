TITLE   :XCLN: Messages Not Saved to Drafts Folder
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2000,98
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Outlook can be configured to save unsent messages to a folder at specified
intervals. If you are typing in the message for an extended period of time, this
interval of time may elapse without the message being saved to the specified
folder. However, when you stop typing, the message is saved to the specified
folder within a few seconds.

NOTE: The default is to save unsent messages every 3 minutes to the Drafts
folder.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. Microsoft Outlook needs some idle time to process
the AutoSave feature.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, you can make use of the AutoRecover feature that
is built into Microsoft Word by following these steps:

1. Start Microsoft Word.

2. On the Tools menu, click Options.

3. Click the Save tab.

4. Change the AutoRecover setting to 1 minute, or whatever length of time you
   want, and then click OK.

5. Quit Microsoft Word.

6. Start Microsoft Outlook.

7. On the Tools menu, click Options.

8. Click the Mail Format tab.

9. Click to select the Use Microsoft Word to edit e-mail messages check box.

10. Click OK.

Microsoft Outlook inherits the setting in Microsoft Word and saves unsent
messages to the specified folder at the specified interval, even if you have
been continuously typing through the time interval.
