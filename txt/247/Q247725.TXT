SUMMARY
=======

When you attempt to install the Windows NT Option Pack (NTOP) on a computer
running Windows NT Server 4.0 Enterprise Edition, the NTOP installation may fail
with a Dr. Watson error for Inetinfo.dbg at approximately 90 percent complete.
The error typically occurs during the portion of the installation when you
configure the default FTP site. The installation may complete. However, when you
restart the computer, which is a required step when installing the NTOP, the
Inetinfo.exe process causes an Access Violation error.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows NT 4.0 Enterprise Edition configuration is accomplished without
installing SP3. The system is configured by directly installing SP5 after
completing the CD installation procedure. Per the following information in the
Windows NT 4.0 Enterprise Edition Readme file, Service Pack 3 is required prior
to installing the NTOP:

   New Windows NT Server/E Installations

   Installing a new copy of Windows NT Server/E is a two step process:

·  First, install Windows NT Server/E in the same way that you install Windows NT Server.

·  After you install Windows NT Server/E, install Service Pack 3. (A prompt reminds you to do this each time you log in, until you have done so.)

   Both steps are required to have a functioning Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition system.

After you install the NTOP, then SP5 or later can be installed.
