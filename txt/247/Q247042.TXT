The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the SNA Server client for Windows NT is installed on a computer running
Windows 2000 Terminal Server, the SnaBase Service fails to start. For example,
if the 3270 applet is started in a Terminal Server session connected to a
Windows 2000 Server computer, the following error message occurs:

   ERROR - The SnaBase Service is not started.

Other SNA Server client components may simply stop responding. The Windows 95
client does not have any problem running in the same environment.

Note: This problem occurs even after the SNA Windows NT client binaries are
registered using the Terminal Services command file that is distributed with SNA
Server.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server Windows NT client software components share a global-memory
mapped file region on the computer, and use named events for the SnaBase service
and SNA applications to coordinate operations with each other. However, SNA
applications are unable to locate the shared memory segment created by the
SnaBase service when they are run under Windows 2000 Terminal Services (WTS).
This is because WTS requires that these applications prepend any named memory
and named events with a "Global\" name prefix.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in SNA
Server 4.0 Service Pack 3.
