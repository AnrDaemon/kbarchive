======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

To add ToolTips for controls in the ActiveX Document server, you can use the
Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) default implementation by calling the
EnableToolTips function, which works correctly. However, for more flexible
functionality of the ToolTip, you can also use the CTooltipCtrl class to create
your own ToolTip control object. If the ToolTips are created by using the
CTooltipCtrl class, it is not shown in the ActiveX Document Container.

CAUSE
=====

When the user calls the server from the document container, the main frame
window is the container's frame window, (that means that the window procedure is
a different window procedure). Thus, it mixes up the z-order of the windows.
However, although the ToolTip window is actually being shown, it is hidden
behind the window of the server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the problem, set the z-order of the ToolTips to the topmost level
after creating the ToolTips. This sample code illustrates the workaround:

   void CTestView::OnInitialUpdate()
   {
   	CFormView::OnInitialUpdate();
   	ResizeParentToFit();

   	CButton * mButton = (CButton *)GetDlgItem(IDC_BUTTON1);

   	if( !m_tooltip.Create(this,TTS_ALWAYSTIP))
   		TRACE(_T("Unable to Create ToolTip"));
   	else if( !m_tooltip.AddTool( mButton, "Show the tooltips"))
   		 TRACE(_T("Unable to add tip for the control window"));
   	else
   	{
   	    m_tooltip.SetWindowPos(&wndTopMost,0,0,0,0,SWP_SHOWWINDOW|
                                       SWP_NOSIZE |SWP_NOMOVE);    
   	    m_tooltip.Activate(TRUE);
   	}	
   }

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Use the MFC AppWizard to generate an ActiveX Document Server application.
   That is, at step 3 of 6, under the category "What compound document support
   would you like to include?", select Full-server and check Active Document
   Server. At step 6, select CFormView as the base class of the view.

2. Add a button, IDC_BUTTON1, to the form view's resource template.

3. Add a private member variable to the view class, as shown here:

   CToolTipCtrl m_tooltip; 

4. In the OnInitialUpdate function of the view class, insert the following code
   snippet to create the ToolTip for the button.

   CButton * mButton = (CButton *)GetDlgItem(IDC_BUTTON1);

   if( !m_tooltip.Create(this,TTS_ALWAYSTIP))
   	TRACE(_T("Unable to Create ToolTip"));
   else if( !m_tooltip.AddTool( mButton, "Show the tooltips"))
           TRACE(_T("Unable to add tip for the control window"));
   else
        m_tooltip.Activate(TRUE);

5. Override the PreTranslateMessage function of the view class and add the
   following code to it:

   if(pMsg->message== WM_LBUTTONDOWN ||
      pMsg->message== WM_LBUTTONUP || 
      pMsg->message== WM_MOUSEMOVE)
   	
      m_tooltip.RelayEvent(pMsg);	

6. Build the application and run it once as a stand alone application. Move the
   pointer over the button. Note that the ToolTip is shown correctly.

7. Now use the MFC AppWizard to generate an ActiveX Document Container
   application. That is, at step 3 of 6, under the category "What compound
   document support would you like to include?", select Container and check
   Active Document Container. Choose the default settings similar the other
   steps except exclude step 3.

8. Build and run the container application. Under the menu item select Edit and
   Insert New Object. Choose the name of your server from the Insert Object
   dialog box and click OK

9. Move the pointer over the button. Notice that the ToolTip is not visible.
