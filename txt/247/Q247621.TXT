TITLE   :Blue Screen with Garbled Text During Windows NT Installation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT 4.0, the first time the computer restarts, which is
between the Text mode and the Graphical User Interface (GUI) mode of Setup,
garbled text may be displayed in the middle of a blue screen.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the Hal.dll file does not correctly identify the
Intel 810E chipset.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, replace the Hal.dll file in the Windows NT 4.0
installation folder with the Hal.dll file included with the Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 4 CD-ROM.

1. Copy and replace the Hal.dl_ file from Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 to the
   Windows NT 4.0 installation folder. If the Hal.dll file included with Windows
   NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 is already extracted, rename the file, and then copy it
   to the Windows NT 4.0 installation folder.

2. Install Windows NT 4.0.

3. Install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 or later.
