TITLE   :PRB: Incorrect SESSION_INFO_XX Pulled in when Compiling _MBCS
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfile kbAPI kbWNet kbDSupport kbGrpDSMFCATL

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When calling the NetSessionEnum() Win32 API function in an application compiled
with _MBCS defined, the SESSION_INFO_XX structure fields are not filled in
correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The NetSessionEnum() Win32 API function always returns values in Unicode in the
SESSION_INFO_XX structures. However, the definitions for these structures in
%MSVCDir%\Include\LMSHARE.h are incorrect. For instance, SESSION_INFO_10 is
defined incorrectly as:

   typedef struct _SESSION_INFO_10 {
       LPTSTR    sesi10_cname;             // client name (no backslashes)
       LPTSTR    sesi10_username;
       DWORD     sesi10_time;
       DWORD     sesi10_idle_time;
   } SESSION_INFO_10, *PSESSION_INFO_10, *LPSESSION_INFO_10;

Note that the string fields are defined as LPTSTR, when they should have been
LPWSTR.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Platform SDK version of LMSHARE.h has the SESSION_INFO_XX structures defined
correctly. Compiling with the Platform SDK version of LMSHARE.h gives correct
results. You can download the latest release of the Platform SDK from the
following Microsoft Web site:

   http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/default.asp?URL=/code/topic.asp?URL=/msdn-files/028/000/123/topic.xml

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
