PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Systems Management Server (SMS) version 2.0 client is installed on a
Microsoft Windows 95-based or Microsoft Windows 98-based computer with the
remote control agent and Nortel Symposium software version 01.11.35 also
installed, the computer may display an "illegal function" error message for the
Wuser32.exe component and stop responding (hang) while displaying the shutdown
screen.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, obtain the latest Windows Library Update from the
following Microsoft Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/downloads/recommended/mfclibrary

This update does not resolve the issue with Wuser32 error messages at shutdown,
but allows the computer to shut down without hanging after you acknowledge the
error message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
