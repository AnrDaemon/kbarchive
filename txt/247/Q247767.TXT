TITLE   :XADM: Unable to Move Mailbox, with Error c1040af1 and Event 1008
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In a Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5-based environment, when you attempt to move a
mailbox from one server to another server in the same site, the move may not be
successful and you may receive the following error message:

   Exchange Administrator: IS unavailable or not running id # c1040af1

Also, Event Viewer may record Event 1008.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the Directory contains inconsistencies or when it
has not been replicated to the other server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, follow these steps at both servers:

1. In Exchange Administrator, open the Directory Service Properties dialog box.

2. On the General tab, click Check Now to check knowledge consistency.

3. On the General tab, click Update Now to update the Directory for the site
   where the server resides.

NOTE: By default, consistency checking, updating, and Message Transfer Agent
routing recalculation automatically occur within 24 hours. However, immediate
consistency checking and updating reduces the likelihood of Directory
inconsistencies' multiplying.
