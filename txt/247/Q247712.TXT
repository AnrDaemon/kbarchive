KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtool kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the drainstop, query, suspend, or stop parameter with Windows Load
Balancing Service (WLBS) at a command prompt, system messages may not accurately
report the computer's status under the following conditions:

 - When you use the drainstop parameter, you receive a message indicating that
   connection draining has started. If you then use the "wlbs query" command,
   the host reports that draining has stopped. If you repeat the "wlbs
   drainstop" command, you receive a message indicating that connection draining
   has started. If you then run the "wlbs stop" command, you receive a message
   indicating that cluster operations have already stopped.

 - When you use the suspend parameter, you receive a message indicating that
   cluster control is suspended. If you then use the "wlbs stop" command, the
   host reports that cluster control has been suspended (although it has already
   been stopped). If you then run the "wlbs drainstop" command, you receive a
   message indicating that cluster control has been suspended and connection
   draining has been started.
