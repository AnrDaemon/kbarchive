TITLE   :STOP 0x0000000A in Ndis.sys When Using Services for Macintosh
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Services for Macintosh on a Windows NT Server-based computer, an
error message in Ndis.sys may appear on a blue screen with the following stop
parameters:

   STOP 0x0000000A (0xF43270C8, 0x00000002, 0x00000000, 0xF3B83A43)

NOTE: The first and last parameters may vary from computer to computer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because Services for Macintosh was installed on the
computer and the service pack that was installed on the server was not
reapplied. To verify this, check the date and time stamp on the following
files:

+-------------------------------------------------+
| Sfmatalk.sys | 10/14/96 1:38 am | 125,232 bytes | 
+-------------------------------------------------+
| Sfmsrv.sys   | 10/14/96 1:38 am | 132,112 bytes | 
+-------------------------------------------------+

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, reapply the current service pack.
