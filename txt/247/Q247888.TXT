TITLE   :XADM: Error c1031b95 Configuring an ADC Connection Agreement
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2000; winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message may be displayed when you configure the From
Exchange tab of a Connection Agreement for the Active Directory Connector (ADC).
This error message may also be displayed when you configure the default Exchange
Server destination in the From Windows tab.

   The credentials specified on the Connections tab are incorrect or do not have
   sufficient permissions to access the Exchange 5.5 Directory. Please ensure
   that the credentials specified are entered correctly and that sufficient
   permissions are granted in order to access the Exchange 5.5 directory.
   ID no: c1031b95
   Microsoft Active Directory Connector Management

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur for either of the following reasons:

1. The Exchange Server 5.5 computer is not running the required service pack or
   later. If you define a Connection Agreement to an Exchange Server site, the
   target directory bridgehead must be running Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack
   2 or later.

2. Permissions are not configured correctly on the Exchange Server 5.5 computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. Apply Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2 or later to the target Exchange
   Server 5.5 computer. If Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 is installed, you
   may need to reapply it.

2. Make sure that the following permissions are correctly configured in this
   domain and on this server:

   a. The Exchange Server service account at the organization, site, and
      configuration levels in the Exchange Server Administrator program must
      have Service Account Administrator rights.

   b. All of the accounts that are used to set up the ADC must have "Access this
      computer from the network" and "Log on locally" rights in Local Computer
      Policy, Default Domain Policy, and Default Domain Controllers Policy
      (click Computer Configurations, click Windows Settings, click Security
      Settings, click Local Policies, and then click User Rights Assignment).

3. Change port to 391 (in case 390 is in use).
