TITLE   :WD97: Index Headings Incorrect with Some Nordic Characters
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word8 word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert an index in your Word document that contains words that begin
with the Nordic character a-ring (an "a" with a ring over it), and other words
that begin with Aa or aa (double a), an additional index heading is inserted as
part of the index as

   

   
       A

   Aaron, 1

   
       A        (a-ring)

   Aaron, 1     (a-ring)

instead of the expected index entry as

   

   
       A

   Aaron, 1

   Aaron, 1     (a-ring)

NOTE: This problem occurs with both the Norwegian Nynorsk and Norwegian Bokmal
regional settings, and even if you define the language ID in the INDEX field.

For additional information about how to define the language that is used to
create your index, click the article number below to view the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

NOTE: This problem does not occur with Microsoft Word 97 for Windows on the
Microsoft Windows 2000 platform.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, convert the index to plain text (unlink the INDEX
field). To do this, select your index and press CTRL+SHIFT+F9. Then delete the
additional index heading.

STATUS
======
