TITLE   :XADM: MSExchangeIS (306) Error in Event Log with Antivirus Use
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use an antivirus program on a computer running Microsoft Windows NT
Server 4.0 Service Pack 3 and Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5, the following error
message may appear in the application log of Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 0
   Source: ESE97
   Category: Performance
   Description: MSExchangeIS (306) Unexpected Windows NT API error. 0xC000000D

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can be caused by a virus protection program, especially when it is
not a program built to recognize Exchange Server processes. The program may
install a file system filter that prevents a JET engine from addressing database
files.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, use one of the two following procedures:

 - Remove the antivirus software, and then restart the server. (Disabling the
   antivirus program is not sufficient.)

   -or-

 - Install a Windows NT hotfix that is part of the roll-up hotfixes recommended
   in the Readme.doc file for Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5. These hotfixes are
   available at:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/nt40/hotfixes-postSP3/roll-up/

   NOTE: If you later reinstall Windows NT service packs, you must also reinstall
   the hotfixes, regardless of your responses to the Overwrite Newer Files
   prompts during the service pack installation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error can occur when you install Norton NT Tools version 1.0. Disabling the
Norton program does not work; you must remove it.

Use of Omtool Fax Senior version 2.5 also produces this error, with an internal
ID of 2030148. The hotfix noted above also corrects this problem.
