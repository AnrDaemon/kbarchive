MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 69: 1900 Is Not A Leap Year
--------------------------------

On Page 69, in the first paragraph, the last sentence states that 1900 was a leap
year, so it had 366 days. This information is incorrect. This sentence should be
deleted.

In addition, it should be noted that the year 1900 is not a leap year as the
illustration at the top of the page indicates by the number 366. It should also
be noted that Microsoft Excel treats 1900 as a leap year, and that this
algorithm was adopted to maintain compatibility with dates in Lotus 1-2-3, and
is by design.
