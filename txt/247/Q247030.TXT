-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5

SYMPTOMS
========

Custom Attributes 11-15 are not being replicated to other sites.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. Custom Attributes 11-15 do not replicate to other
sites by default. Intersite replication of these attributes can be enabled
through the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program.

RESOLUTION
==========

To replicate these attributes outside the site:

1. In the Administrator program, click to expand the Configuration container for
   your site.

2. Double-click the DS Site Configuration object or click it, and click
   Properties on the File menu.

3. Click the Attributes tab.

4. Under Configure, click Inter-site replication.

5. Under Show attributes for, click "All mail recipients" from the list, and
   click to select the attributes you want to be replicated to other sites.
