TITLE   :XCLN: Sent Time Info Incorrect for Delayed Delivery Messages
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2000,97,98
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use Outlook 97, Outlook 98, or Outlook 2000 to send a delayed message,
the actual "Sent Time" time stamp information for that message is the compose
time of the message and not the actual sent time. This is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Outlook 97, Outlook 98, and Outlook 2000 all have a facility to create a message
and delay its delivery by a specific period of time. This delay period can range
from 1 minute to several weeks. When the message is eventually delivered, the
recipient still sees the time at which the message was composed by the client,
and not the time the message actually left the Outbox.
