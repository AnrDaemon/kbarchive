======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a user sends a message to a Microsoft Exchange Server distribution list
(DL), the user may receive the following non-delivery report (NDR) for one or
more recipients:

   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.
   Subject: TEST
   Sent: 10/10/99
   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:
   /o=Organization/ou=Site/cn=RECIPIENTS/cn=Mailbox
   The message was undeliverable because the recipient specified in the recipient
   postal address was not known at this address
   MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:Site:ComputerName

The DL in the global address list shows that the recipient is not a member of the
DL.

CAUSE
=====

This may occur if the recipient was a member of a distribution list in another
site and was recently deleted from this DL. The DL is located on a server in a
site that is different from the site on which the user is hosted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
