TITLE   :Cannot Log On After Removing Everyone Group from Permissions
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you remove the Everyone group from the permissions of the Microsoft Windows
NT 4.0 root folder on the local computer, you may not be able to log on after
you restart the computer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the Everyone group is a Windows NT 4.0 special
group that is used to grant access to resources on the computer for both local
and remote users. When you remove the Everyone group from the permissions of the
%SystemRoot% folder, you cannot log on to the computer because you no longer
have permissions to the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, install a parallel copy of Windows NT 4.0 and then log
on to the parallel installation. In Windows Explorer, add the Everyone group to
the share permissions of the \Winnt folder of the original installation, and
grant the Everyone group either Full Control or Change permissions.
