SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Active Server Pages (ASP) and attempt to set a cookie exportation
date past January 19, 2038, one of the following ASP 200 error messages occurs
(depending on the version of IIS you are running):

   IIS 4.0

   Cookies object error 'ASP 0200 : 0x80004005'
   Out of Range 'Expires' attribute
   /path/file.asp, line nn
   The date given for 'Expires' precedes Jan 1, 1980 or exceeds Jan 19, 2038,
   3:14:07 GMT.

   IIS 5.0

   Error Type:
   Cookies object, ASP 0200 (0x80004005)
   Out of Range 'Expires' attribute
   The date and time given for 'Expires' precedes Jan 1, 1980 or exceeds Jan 19,
   2038, 3:14:07 GMT.
   /path/file.asp, line nn

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by an overflow of the time_t variable in the C/C++ programming
language. This variable is a 32-bit integer value used as an offset in seconds
from January 1, 1970. This variable has a maximum value of 2147483647, which
only allows dates through 3:14:07 GMT on January 19, 2038.
