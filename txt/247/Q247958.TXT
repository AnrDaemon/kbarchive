SUMMARY
=======

When you install the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack (NTOP), the root directory of
the Default Web Site is Inetpub\Wwwroot. During setup, in the Inetpub folder,
the Mailroot subdirectory is created with the following subfolders used by the
SMTP service:

    - BadMail

 - Drop

 - MailBox

 - PickUp

 - Queue

 - Route

 - SortTemp

If you move the Inetpub directory to another drive or folder and delete the
original Inetpub directory, when you restart your Web server, the folders for
the SMTP Service are re-created in the Inetpub directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To configure the SMTP service to use the new root directory, you must change the
path information in the metabase. To manually make the changes necessary to the
metabase, use MetaEdit from the IIS Resource Kit or programmatically use ADSI
APIs. To do this, perform the following steps:

1. Edit the metabase and open LM/SMTPSVC.

2. Edit ID 36930 to reference the new SortTemp directory.

3. Open LM/SMTPSVC/1/QueueDirectory and edit the string to reference the new
   folder.

4. Open LM/SMTPSVC/1/PickupDirectory and edit the string to reference the new
   folder.

5. Open LM/SMTPSVC/1/DropDirectory and edit the string to reference the new
   folder

6. Open LM/SMTPSVC/1/BadMailDirectory and edit the string to reference the new
   folder.

7. Open LM/SMTPSVC/1/RoutingSources and edit the multisz to reference the new
   folder.

8. Open LM/SMTPSVC/1/Root/MailBox/Path and edit the string to reference the new
   folder.

9. From the command prompt or services, stop the IIS Admin Service using the
   following command:

   net stop IISADMIN

10. For the changes to take effect, restart the Web Publishing Service using the
   following command:

   net start W3SVC
