SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000, sounds in the program may be cut
off, break up, or be played inconsistently.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if a Creative Labs Sound Blaster PCI 64 sound card is
installed in your computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, download and install the latest version of the sound
driver for your sound card from the following Creative Labs Web site:

   http://www.creative.com

To work around this issue in Microsoft Windows 98, reduce the audio hardware
acceleration setting:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "dxdiag" (without the quotation marks), and then click
   OK.

3. Click the Sound tab.

4. Under DirectX Features, move the Hardware Sound Acceleration Level slider all
   the way to the left (the "No acceleration" setting).

5. Click Exit.

NOTE: These steps require that Microsoft DirectX 7.0 or later is installed on the
computer.
