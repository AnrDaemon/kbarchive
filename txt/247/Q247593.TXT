======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to log on to an Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 computer,
the following error message may occur:

   401.1 Unauthorized: Logon failed

CAUSE
=====

This problem may be caused by a number of reasons, however, the following are
the most common:

 - The users credentials (the username and password) are not correct.

 - The user account may not have the right to log on to the computer
   interactively (the "log on locally" right).

RESOLUTION
==========

Check the username and the password of the user to make sure that they are
correct. If this is correct, be sure the user has the "log on locally" right
granted to it.

To verify user rights, do the following:

1. Open the Local Security Policy tool from the Administrative Tools folder.

2. Select Local Policies, choose User Rights Assignment, and then click the Log
   On Locally user right.

If the user account or group that the user belongs to is not listed, then add it.

MORE INFORMATION
================
