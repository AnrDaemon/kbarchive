SYMPTOMS
========

When you restart your computer after receiving an error message from Microsoft
Exchange Server 5.5 and then try to start the Directory service (DS), Event
Viewer records the following event:

   Event ID: 1002
   Source: MSExchangeDS
   Type: Error
   Category: Internal Processing
   Description: The Microsoft Exchange Server database, EDB, could not be
   initialized and returned error -1507. Unrecoverable error. The directory
   cannot continue.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the Directory database (Dir.edb) structure is
damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, restore the Directory database (Dir.edb) from a tape
backup.

NOTE: If you do not have a valid backup of the Directory database (Dir.edb), you
can restore the file through full disaster recovery of Exchange Server.
