PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbVBp600 kbGrpDSVBDB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When trying to set the DataSource or RowSource properties of the DataList or
DataCombo controls in a project that also contains the Crystal Reports Smart
Viewer control, you may see one or all of the following symptoms:

 - The entire property page of the control goes blank.

 - Visual Basic stops responding and requires you to end the task.

 - You may receive the following error:

   vb6.exe Application Error
   The instruction at "0x0055d620" referenced memory at "0x0000003"
   The memory could not be read.

NOTE: The exact memory locations may vary from system to system.

Although these symptoms have been verified only with the DataList and DataCombo
controls, the problem can occur with any data-aware control.

RESOLUTION
==========

According to Seagate Technical Support, to work around this, remove the Smart
Viewer Control from the project when you need to edit the DataSource or
RowSource properties of any data-aware control that causes the symptoms listed
above. After the properties have been edited, add the Smart Viewer Control back
into the project.
