======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The AddSystem and Addsytemgui utilities in the Systems Management Server (SMS)
Resource Kit have the following problems:

1. They are hard coded to create a DDR with the sitecode set to BER.

2. They do not set and key properties on DDRAddxxx functions. Because of this,
   if Addsytem is run again on the same computer, a duplicate resource is
   created under SMS. Note that DDM has no way of checking if the resource
   already exists.

3. Addsytem sets some wrong properties in the DDR and misses some required ones.

4. Operating System Name and Version property is hard coded to Microsoft Windows
   NT Advanced Server 4.0. This should be set dependent on the operating system
   installed (Windows NT Workstation 4.0, Windows NT Server 4.0, Windows NT
   Advanced Server 4.0). This would permit the remote installation service to
   act on operating system type if the administrator has set specific types to
   be installed, such as workstations only, servers only, and so on.
