TITLE   :XADM: Exchange Administrator Stops When Moving Mailbox
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you move a mailbox from one server to another server in Microsoft Exchange
Server 5.0 or 5.5, the Exchange Administrator may stop responding and you must
restart the Exchange Server to restart the program.

This can happen on either the server where the mailbox originates, or the server
where you move the mailbox.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when there is an integrity problem or corruption in the
private information store.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, run the Isinteg utility against the private information
store. Follow these steps:

1. Stop the Information Store (IS) service.

2. At the Microsoft Windows NT command prompt, use the cd command to switch to
   the network drive that contains the Exchange Server directory.

3. Use the cd command to switch to the Exchsrvr\bin folder, and then press
   ENTER.

4. To check the integrity of the private information store, type the following
   at the Microsoft Windows NT command prompt, and then press ENTER:

   isinteg -test -pri

   NOTE: To repair any problems that the scan locates, type isinteg -fix -pri at
   the command prompt and then press ENTER.

5. Restart the IS service.
