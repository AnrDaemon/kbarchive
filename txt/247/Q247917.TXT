TITLE   :Hewlett-Packard JetDirect Ports Missing on Windows NT 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a computer running Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 or Microsoft Windows NT
Workstation 4.0, you may notice that the Hewlett-Packard (HP) JetDirect ports
are missing without your having deleted any ports.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because HP JetDirect ports in HP JetAdmin version 3.3 can
cause corruption in certain Windows NT registry entries. The resulting loss of
Internet Protocol (IP) address information and local area network (LAN) hardware
information causes the ports to disappear.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue (if your copy of the HP JetAdmin program is earlier than
version 3.4), remove HP JetAdmin and all the existing HP JetDirect ports.
Install HP JetAdmin version 3.4 or later, and then recreate the HP JetDirect
ports.
