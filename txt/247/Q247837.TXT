TITLE   :FS2000: Unexpected Action When You Press SideWinder Button
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui fsim kbimu msgame

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 
 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 Professional Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you press a button on a Microsoft SideWinder game controller while you are
playing Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000, an unexpected action may occur.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you press a button combination that includes the
Shift button on the game controller. By default, you cannot use the Shift button
on a SideWinder game controller to modify the action assigned to another game
controller button in Flight Simulator 2000.

The Shift button functions only as a single button, unless you reconfigure the
SideWinder game controller in the SideWinder Profile Editor.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, configure your SideWinder game controller in the
SideWinder Profile Editor to use the Shift button as a modifier button in button
combinations:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Hardware, point to Game
   Controllers, and then click SideWinder Profile Editor.

2. Click the SideWinder game controller for which you want to create the
   profile, and then click OK.

3. On the Recorder tab, under Name, click the button to which you want to assign
   an action in the game.

4. Type a name for the action you want to assign.

5. Under Programmable Action, click the box to the right of the button you just
   named.

6. Click the Keystrokes tab, and then press the key or key combination you want
   to assign to this button.

7. Click OK.

8. Repeat steps 3 through 7 to assign any other keys or key combinations to this
   profile.

9. On the File menu, click Save As.

10. In the "Save as type" box, click to select your SideWinder game controller.

11. In the "File name" box, type a name for the profile, and then click Save.
