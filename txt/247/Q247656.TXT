TITLE   :XADM: How to Locate the Source of a Rogue Server Monitor
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

One of the features of Exchange Server is server monitors. One of the key
features of a server monitor is time synchronization between Exchange Server
computers. However, server monitors can change the Exchange Server computer's
time to an unwanted value, and it can be difficult to track the source of this
server monitor. This article explains how to find the rogue server monitor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can locate the IP address of the rogue monitor by using Network Monitor.

NOTE: If you need the full Microsoft Systems Management Server version of
Netmon.exe, contact Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS) to request a trial
version.

1. Set the Exchange Server computer to the correct time.

2. Using Network Monitor, capture all traffic inbound to and outbound from the
   Exchange Server computer that is experiencing the time changes.

3. Observe the time on the Exchange Server computer. As soon as the time is
   changed, stop the Network Monitor trace.

4. In Network Monitor, click Display Captured Data on the Capture menu (or press
   F12) to display the captured data.

Next, filter for the MSRPC traffic:

1. On the toolbar, click the Edit Display Filter icon (funnel).

2. In the Display Filter dialog box, double-click Protocol==Any.

3. Click Disable All.

4. In the Disabled Protocols list, click MSRPC, and then click Enable.

5. Click OK to clear the Expression window, and then click OK to clear the
   Display Filter window.

You now have MSRPC traffic.

Next, locate the Admin universally unique identifier (UUID) that indicates that a
server monitor is connecting to this server:

1. On the toolbar, click the Find icon (binoculars) to open the Find Frame
   Expression window.

2. In the Protocol:Property list, click MSRPC, and then click the plus sign (+)
   to expand the RPC options.

3. Just below MSRPC, click Abstract Interface UUID, and paste the following UUID
   in the Value (Array of Bytes) field:

       F0 2B D7 83 89 0D CE 11 B1 3F 00 AA 00 3B AC 6C

4. Click OK. This will take you to the frame where the Admin program is
   connecting to this server.

5. Continue to click the Find Next icon until you locate a frame that contains
   an opnum of 0x3. This opnum indicates that you are setting the remote system
   time.

6. Double-click on this frame and expand the frame information. Scroll up to
   display the IP header.

7. Expand the IP header, and scroll down to the IP: Source Address. This is the
   IP address of the rogue server monitor.
