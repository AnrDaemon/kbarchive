SUMMARY
=======

In Outlook 97, Outlook 98, and Outlook 2000, the Rules wizard does not allow you
to move (or in any way process) a mail item that was sent on behalf of another
user. To create such a rule, you need to use custom forms and rules based on
categories.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Exchange Server gives you the ability to send mail on behalf of
another user. This is done by giving the appropriate permission in the Microsoft
Exchange Server Administrator program. For additional information on how to do
so, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft

   Q234696 XCLN: How to Set Up 'Send on Behalf Of' Permissions

For example, if a user called USER1 has been given such rights for USER2, then
USER1 can send a message on behalf of USER2. If you want to create a rule such
that all messages sent by USER1 on behalf of USER2 are moved to a folder called
Sent On Behalf Of USER2, nothing in the Rules wizard lets you do that.

One solution is to create a custom form that will be preset to a category called
"Sent On Behalf Of." In this example, USER1 can use this form whenever he or she
sends mail on behalf of USER2. You can then create a rule that checks messages
after they are sent, checks if the category is set to Sent On Behalf Of and, if
so, moves those messages to a specific folder (or processes those messages in
other ways).

The detailed steps are given below. These steps are for Outlook 97, but the same
steps apply, with minor differences, for Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000. To create
a form:

1. In Outlook 97, open a new message form.

2. On the Edit menu, click Categories.

3. Add a category called "Sent On Behalf Of," and then click OK.

4. On the Tools menu, click Design Outlook Form.

5. On the File menu, click Publish Form As.

6. Give a name to the form (for example, SentOnBehalfOf).

7. Click Publish. By default, the form is published in the Personal Forms
   Library.

8. On the File menu, click Close. Click No, when you are prompted to save
   changes.

To create a rule:

1. On the Tools menu, click Rules Wizard, and then click New.

2. Click the "When I send a message" radio button, and then click Next.

3. In the "Which conditions do you want to check" box, click Assigned To
   Category.

4. In the Rule description box, click Category.

5. Type "Sent On Behalf Of" (without the quotation marks), click OK, and then
   click Next.

6. Click "Move a copy to the Specified Folder".

7. In the Rule description box, click Specified.

8. Choose the folder to which you want the message to be moved.

9. Click OK, and then click Next.

10. Click Next, click Finish, and then click OK twice.

NOTE: The procedure shows one of the several ways in which a category may be used
to filter mail. There are several other ways. Which method you use depends on
the objective you want to achieve and the peculiarities and limitations of your
environment.
