SUMMARY
=======

This article demonstrates how to add sound, or .wav files, to a form.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although you can use the SET BELL TO command to play a waveform file, you do not
have control over the file once it starts. That is, you cannot stop, pause, or
resume the waveform file. By using the Microsoft Multimedia Control version 6,
you can play a waveform file when the form is opened or whenever you wish to add
sound.

Because you have control over the waveform file, it is not necessary to have the
Multimedia control visible. All actions can be controlled through code.

1. In the Tools menu, under Options, click the Controls tab. Click ActiveX
   Controls, scroll down the list and select Microsoft Multimedia Control
   version 6, and then click OK.

2. Create a new form.

3. On the Form Controls toolbar, click the View Classes button, and then select
   ActiveX Controls.

4. Click the Multimedia control and add it to the form.

5. Select the Multimedia control and change the Name property to MCI. Change the
   Visible property to .F.

6. Open the Init event of the Multimedia control and add the following code:

   * Set properties needed by MCI to open.
   THISFORM.MCI.NOTIFY = .T.		&& Pause
   THISFORM.MCI.WAIT = .T.
   THISFORM.MCI.Shareable = .F.
   THISFORM.MCI.DeviceType = "WaveAudio"
   THISFORM.MCI.RecordEnabled = .T.
   THISFORM.MCI.RecordMode = 0
   THISFORM.MCI.StopEnabled = .T.
   THISFORM.MCI.FileName = GETFILE("wav")

   * Open the MCI WaveAudio device.
   THISFORM.MCI.COMMAND = "Open"
   THISFORM.MCI.COMMAND = "Play"

7. Add a Command button and change the caption to "Stop" (without the quotation
   marks).

8. In the click event of the Stop button, add this code:

   IF THIS.CAPTION="Stop"
   	THISFORM.MCI.COMMAND = "Stop"
   	THIS.CAPTION="Restart"
   ELSE
   	THISFORM.MCI.COMMAND = "Play"
   	THIS.CAPTION="Stop"
   ENDIF

9. In the Destroy event of the form, add this code:

   THISFORM.MCI.COMMAND = "Close"

10. Add another Command button and change the caption to "Rewind" (without the
   quotation marks).

11. In the click event of the Rewind button, add this code:

   THISFORM.MCI.COMMAND = "Seek"
   THISFORM.MCI.COMMAND = "Play"

This is just to show how you can replay the waveform file.

Run the form. If you have a valid waveform file, enter the path and name in the
Thisform.MCI.FileName property in the Init event of the control instead of using
the GETFILE() function. Click on the Stop button to stop the waveform file, then
click on the Restart button to resume playing the waveform file at the same
position.
