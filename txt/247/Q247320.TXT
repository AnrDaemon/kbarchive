======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You can edit the Use This User ID field in the Host Account Manager
(Udconfig.exe) program even though the User May Override Mapping option is
disabled in the Host Security Domain (HSD) that the user is a member of.

The Use Windows NT User Name or Use This User ID radio buttons are disabled as
they should be when the User May Override Mapping option is disabled for the
selected HSD. However, the edit box for the Use This User ID field is not
disabled and can be edited.

This problem only occurs if the HSD is defined to use mapped User IDs. It does
not occur if replicated User IDs are being used.

CAUSE
=====

The Host Account Manager program does not correctly check the User May Override
Mapping option prior to enabling the Use This User ID edit box.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack

3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3.

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Host Account Manager has been updated to correctly check the User May Override
Mapping option before enabling the Use This User ID edit box. If the User May
Override Mapping option is disabled, the radio buttons and edit boxes are
disabled.
