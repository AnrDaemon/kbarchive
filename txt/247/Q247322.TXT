The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A workstation running the SNA client software may receive the following error
when trying to make a connection to a host through SNA Server using the 3270
Applet:

   Error Reading Configuration File.

In addition, an Event 705 may be logged on the SNA Server in the Application
Event log with the following description:

   Logon Failed.
   EXPLANATION Connection request failed due to data security.

CAUSE
=====

The user who is logged onto the client computer is not logged onto the Windows
NT domain that the SNA Server is a member of, or the user has not been given
access to any logical units (LUs) on the SNA Server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the error, use any of the following methods:

 - Create a trust between the Windows NT domain that the client user is logged
   onto and the one in which the SNA Server resides. Assign the user (or group
   that the user is a member of) appropriate LUs in the Configured Users folder
   in SNA Manager.

 - Create a user ID and password in the Windows NT domain in which the SNA
   Server resides that is identical to the user account and password that the
   user uses to log onto his or her Windows NT domain. Assign the user (or group
   that the user is a member of) appropriate LUs in the Configured Users folder
   in SNA Manager.

 - Enable the Windows NT guest account on the SNA Server. Assign this account
   appropriate LUs on the SNA Server. The client users must log on as "guest" in
   the Windows NT domain in which the SNA Server resides in order to obtain
   access to the LUs assigned to the guest user.

Please refer to SNA Server Help for more information on assigning LUs to users
and groups and enabling the Windows NT guest account.
