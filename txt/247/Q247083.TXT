SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Importers for Lotus cc:Mail Archives and Notes Mail move messages
from existing cc:Mail archive files and Notes mail databases to Microsoft
Exchange server, allowing users to preserve business-critical information. These
importers help automate the migration process from cc:Mail and Notes to Exchange
server, making it less time and resource intensive for IT and users. As part of
the migration process the importers also resolve the addresses of authors as
they convert messages, allowing users to "reply" and "reply-all" directly from
Exchange.
