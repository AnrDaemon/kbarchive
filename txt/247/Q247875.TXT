TITLE   :XCLN: Mapped Drive Letter Path Changes to UNC Path
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::8.04; WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 97, version 8.04 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a mapped drive letter in the pathname to a file such as an
AutoArchive .pst file, the path to the file changes from
<drive>:\<folder>\Archive.pst to
\\<Servername>\<Sharename>\Archive.pst. You can see this change when
you use Browse to locate the file and then click OK.

CAUSE
=====

The file you are working with is being saved to a distributed file system (Dfs)
volume. With Dfs, you can create a single directory tree that includes multiple
file servers and file shares in a group, division, or enterprise.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the issue you can do one of the following:

 - To retain the mapped drive letter name, save the file to a non-Dfs volume.

 - Do not use the Browse button to locate the folder. Instead, manually type the
   path name of the location where you want to save the file. For example:

   "g:\<folder>\archive.pst" (without the quotation marks)
