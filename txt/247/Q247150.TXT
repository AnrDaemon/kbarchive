   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

Immediately after you run the eseutil /r command with a defined switch (for
example, /ds or /is), the following error message may be displayed at the
command prompt:

   Microsoft(R) Windows NT(TM) Server Database Utilities Version 5.5 Copyright
   (C) Microsoft Corporation 1991-1999. All Rights Reserved.

   Error encountered accessing registry keys/values for specified Exchange
   Store.

   Exchange registry key access was denied, use default setting...

   Initiating RECOVERY mode...
   Log files: <current directory>
   System files: <current directory>

   Performing soft recovery...

Although soft recovery may appear to run successfully and complete with an
"Operation completed successfully" message, information in the log files may not
be applied to the database.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Windows NT account you are logged on as does
not have Full Control permissions on the registry key that contains the path to
the log files.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Give the currently logged on Windows NT account Full Control permissions on the
appropriate registry key:

 - If you run the eseutil /r /ds command, check the permissions on the following
   registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CCS\Services\MSExchangeDS\Parameters

 - If you run the eseutil /r /is command, check the permissions on the following
   registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CCS\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersSystem

WORKAROUND
==========

If you are unable to assign the proper registry permissions, you can specify the
log files and the system files locations at run time. For example, to run soft
recovery on the information store database(s) when the log files are located in
the <x>:\Exchsrvr\Mdbdata folder and the Edb.chk file is located in the
<y>:\Exchsrvr\Mdbdata folder, run the following command:

   eseutil /r /lX:\exchsrvr\mdbdata /sY:\exchsrvr\mdbdata

You do not need to specify the location of the database(s) because the location
of the database(s) is read from each log file during recovery.
