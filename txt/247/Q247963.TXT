SUMMARY

This article illustrates how to call the SipShowIM API to activate the virtual

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step by Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a new Windows CE Palm-size PC project in either Visual Basic or
   eMbedded Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Place two CommandButtons on Form1.

3. Paste the following code into Form1:

   Option Explicit
   Declare Function SipShowIM Lib "coredll" (ByVal flags As Long) As Long

   Private Sub Form_Load()
       Command1.Caption = "Show Keyboard"
       Command2.Caption = "Hide Keyboard"
       Form1.Caption = "SipShowIM Sample"
   End Sub

   Private Function Showkeyboard() As Long
       Showkeyboard = SipShowIM(1)
   End Function

   Private Function Hidekeyboard() As Long
       Hidekeyboard = SipShowIM(0)
   End Function

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
       Showkeyboard
   End Sub

   Private Sub Command2_Click()
       Hidekeyboard
   End Sub

4. Run the project and click the CommandButtons to show and hide the virtual
   keyboard.

NOTE: This sample only runs on the device and not in the emulator.

NOTE: On PocketPC and PocketPC2002 devices, the SIP can be displayed using the
SIPVisible property of the Form object.
