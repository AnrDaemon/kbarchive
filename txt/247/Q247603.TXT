======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to an Internet Information Services 5.0 Web site (or a
particular page on that site), the following error message may occur:

   401.3 Unauthorized due to ACL on resource

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when permissions for the file that the user is trying to
access are denied to that user. This error message differs from a standard 401
error message, in that, the user has been logged on to the server, but the
resource that the user is trying to access is restricted. For example, if only
Administrators and LocalSystem have access to a file on the server and a user,
who is a member of the Users group, tries to access it, the user receives a
401.3 (provided they can log on to the server).

RESOLUTION
==========

Check the NTFS permissions on the file in question. Make sure the users or
groups that need access to the file are listed in the file permissions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information about setting access permissions on files, see the Windows
2000 documentation.
