TITLE   :Cannot Resolve NetBIOS Name of Remote Domain Controller
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to a specific server in a Microsoft Windows NT
Server 4.0-based resource domain, the connection may not succeed and you may
receive the following error message:

   Login server cannot be found

There are no static entries in your Lmhosts file. When you view the local network
basic input/output system (NetBIOS) name cache on the computer, a 1C (domain
controller) entry appears for the resource domain.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur when the local NetBIOS name cache is corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, use the Nbtstat -R command to purge the local name
cache. The computer uses Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) to obtain the 1C
name of the domain controller.
