SUMMARY
=======

When using the ActiveX Scripting interfaces to host an ActiveX Script Engine,
the following methods may return an undocumented error code 0x80020101:

 - IActiveScriptParse::ParseScriptText

-and

 - IActiveScript::InterruptScriptThread

The HRESULT 0x80020101 translates to SCRIPT_E_REPORTED. This error can be
observed when a scripting component fails under MTS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When an ActiveX Script Engine, such as VBScript or JScript, encounters an error
it attempts to report the error to its script host by calling the following
methods:

 - IActiveScriptSite::OnScriptError

-or

 - IActiveScriptSiteDebug::OnScriptErrorDebug

After one of these methods is called, the script engine must also return an
HRESULT from the method that was called when the error occurred. To warn the
script host that the error has already been reported, and to ensure that a
single error does not result in more than one notification, the script engine
returns SCRIPT_E_REPORTED. This indicates that the error has already been
handled and the host need not take further action.
