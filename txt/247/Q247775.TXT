   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are administering Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5, you may receive
reports every six hours that users are unable to gain access to their inboxes.
This lasts for about 15 minutes and occurs on an Exchange Server that has many
more inboxes than the other servers in the site.

When you examine the MSExchangeDS\Pending Replication Synchronization counter in
Performance Monitor, you see that the counter records abnormally high numbers
during the problem time periods.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the server's Directory service is unable to handle
all of the remote procedure call (RPC) requests it receives.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this issue, change two values in the registry. Follow these steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the Max Threads(EXDS+NSP+DSA) value entry under the following registry
   key:

HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeDS\Parameters

3. Double-click the value and set it to the equivalent of (50 * number of
   processors) + 30.

4. Locate the "Replicator Maximum concurrent read threads" value entry under the
   following registry key:

HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeDS\Parameters

5. Double-click the value, and then set it to zero (0).

6. Quit Registry Editor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you examine the Period-Rep-Sync-Times attribute on the site properties
dialog box in Raw mode, you see that the schedule is set at every six hours.
This is the interval at which each server in the site sends out requests to get
Directory updates from within the site.
