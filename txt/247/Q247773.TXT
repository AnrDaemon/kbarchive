TITLE   :XADM: Cannot Use IMS After Exchange 5.0 Server SP2 Added to 5.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add a server running Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2)
to a site that contains only an Exchange Server 5.0 computer without SP2, and
then attempt to administer the Internet Mail Service from any Microsoft Exchange
Server Administrator program in the site, you may receive the following error
message:

   Extension SMTP could not be loaded.

Event Viewer lists the following event in the application log:

   Event ID: 2037
   Source: MSExchangeSA
   Description: The file version of '\add-ins\smtp\i386\imcadmin.dll' installed
   on the local server is not current. Unable to locate a current version on any
   server in the site.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the new version of the proxy address generators
that comes with SP2 is installed in the directory but not yet replicated to the
other server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, perform one of the following procedures:

 - Apply SP2 to the Exchange Server 5.0-based computer.

   -or-

 - Copy the proxy address generators (such as Inproxy.dll, X400prox.dll, and so
   on) from the Exchange Server computer that is running SP2 to the Exchange
   Server computer that is not running SP2.
