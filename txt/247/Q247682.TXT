TITLE   :Lmhosts File Incorrectly Parsed with Alternate Block Inclusion
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An Lmhosts file that uses #BEGIN_ALTERNATE / #END_ALTERNATE tags with #INCLUDE
statements parses all Lmhosts files that are pointed to using the #INCLUDE
statements. For example:

#BEGIN_ALTERNATE
#INCLUDE \\Lmhostsrv1\Public\Lmhosts    
#INCLUDE \\Lmhostsrv2\Public\Lmhosts 
#END_ALTERNATE

NOTE: In this example the Lmhosts files from both Lmhostsrv1 and Lmhostsrv2 are
parsed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the #ALTERNATE_INCLUDE condition is satisfied if
one of the #INCLUDE statements is successful. This means that only one Lmhosts
file should be parsed. The first successful #INCLUDE statement is the only
Lmhosts file that should be parsed, but all Lmhosts files that are pointed to
using #INCLUDE statements are parsed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT 4.0.
