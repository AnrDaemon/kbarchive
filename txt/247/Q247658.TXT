SUMMARY
=======

When you access the Web server, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) session IDs and other
SSL session information are kept in the Schannel cache. You must know the length
of time that the SSL session information is cached so that you can set the
appropriate length when you develop load-balancing applications that identify
separate users based on their SSL session number. You can modify the length of
time that the SSL session information is cached for Internet Information Server
(IIS) 4.0 and Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 with the registry entries
that are described in the Modify the SChannel Cache section of this article.

Modify the SChannel Cache
-------------------------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To modify the length of time that the SSL session information is cached, follow
these steps:

1. Open Registry Editor. To do this, click Start, click Run, type "regedt32"
   (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

2. Click to select the following key in the registry:

   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE][System][CurrentControlSet][Control][SecurityProviders][SCHANNEL]

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, type "ClientCacheTime" (without the
   quotation marks) in the Value Name box, select REG_DWORD for Data Type, and
   then click OK.

4. In the Data box, type a value in milliseconds, click Decimal, and then click
   OK.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 to add the ServerCacheTime value.

6. Exit Registry Editor.

Additional Notes
----------------

The following are the registry key locations and values:

 - [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE]

 - [System]

 - [CurrentControlSet]

 - [Control]

 - [SecurityProviders]

 - [SCHANNEL]

 - ClientCacheTime:REG_DWORD (the time to expire client side cache elements)

 - ServerCacheTime:REG_DWORD (the time to expire server side cache elements)

Values are calibrated in milliseconds. The default is 120000 (2 minutes), and
keys do not appear in the registry unless they are changed from their default. A
value of 0 turns off the secure connection caching.

The registry key locations and values apply to all versions of the Schannel. Keep
the server-side interval short for better management of the overall size of the
Schannel cache.
