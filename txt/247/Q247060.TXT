TITLE   :Error Message in Ntbackup.exe When Starting to Read Tapes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Backup (Ntbackup.exe), it attempts to read the tapes. If the
format of a tape is not compatible with Ntbackup.exe, an access violation that
generates a Dr. Watson error message may occur.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if a tape contains an incompatible data format. Not all
formats cause this behavior; some formats may generate an "unrecognized tape"
error message instead.


RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this issue from occurring, use another tape without any incompatible
backup sets or formats. Also, do not mix backup sets from different backup
software.

MORE INFORMATION
================

All tapes that are used to create a backup with Ntbackup.exe use a standard
backup format called Microsoft Tape Format (MTF). MTF is also used in the
Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 backup program. This feature enables SQL Server backups
to coexist on the same media as backups that are not SQL Server backups (foreign
backup sets), provided that the backups use MTF. For example, both SQL Server
7.0 backups and Microsoft Windows NT backups can exist on the same media. This
is not the case for the SQL Server 6.5 backup program, which uses a different
format.
