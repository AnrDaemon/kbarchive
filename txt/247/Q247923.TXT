======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Windows 95-based clients that are running Systems Management Server
(SMS) 2.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1) may display a general protection (GP) fault if
the client is remotely controlled by an administrator on a SMS 2.0 SP1-based
server.

CAUSE
=====

When the Windows 95-based client is establishing a remote control session,
Wuser32.exe searches for the Security.dll file on the client computer. Some
third-party programs have their own Security.dll file that is found first
because the program created an addition to the system path. This can cause the
Windows 95-based client to become unstable.

WORKAROUND
==========

Remove the third-party program, or remove the entry in the path that the
third-party program created. This entry is located in the registry or the
Autoexec.bat file on Windows 95-based clients.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
