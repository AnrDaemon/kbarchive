TITLE   :Browsing HTML Administrator without Default Document Enabled Ret
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server

KEYWORDS:kbOSWin2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to browse the HTML Administration Web site with no default
document enabled and directory browsing disabled returns, an error similar to
the following occurs:

   HTTP Error 403 - Forbidden
   You are not authorized to view this page
   You might not have permission to view this directory or page using the
   credentials you supplied.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. When a client request is made to a folder or Web
site that has no default document enabled and has directory browsing disabled,
Internet Information Services (IIS) returns an "HTTP 403 Forbidden" error
message to inform the client that the request is denied for reasons other than
an authentication error, which results in an "HTTP 401 Unauthorized" error
message.
