TITLE   :Cluster Server Is Not Configured Properly After Unattended Setup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Cluster Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform an unattended setup of Cluster Server with multiple network
connections declared for client access, Setup may not automatically choose the
optimum network connection for the "Cluster IP address" resource. Instead, Setup
may use the first network connection that is declared available for client
access.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you have declared more than one network connection as
available for client access.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Declare only one network connection as available for client access.

2. Declare all other network connections as "For internal communications only".

3. After Setup has finished, use the command-line tool Cluster.exe to declare
   any additional network connections.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
