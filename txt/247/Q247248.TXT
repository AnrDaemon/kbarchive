======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When accessing the Class Browser, Visual FoxPro may return the following error:

   Invalid buffdirty call

And then Visual FoxPro quits.

CAUSE
=====

Possible causes of this problem are a corrupted Browser.dbf file resulting from
an abnormal termination of Visual FoxPro from a power outage, a computer lockup
or restart, and turning the computer off without properly shutting it down.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two ways to resolve the problem.

 - Delete the two files, Browser.dbf and Browser.fpt.

   CD (HOME())
   ERASE browser.dbf
   ERASE browser.fpt

   NOTE: these two files are created if they do not exist when the Class Browser
   is run.

 - Zap the Browser table.

   USE (HOME() + "browser") EXCLUSIVE
   ZAP
   USE

   This clears any corrupted records in the table and prepares it for initial use
   again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Invalid buffdirty call is not limited to the Class Browser.

Additional query words: Class Browser, GPF, buffdirty
