When you turn on a computer running Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Server Service Pack
4, you may receive the following STOP error at the blue screen that identifies
the Windows NT build:

   STOP 0x0000001e (0xc0000005, 0x801a8a83, 0x00000000, 0x005c0069)
   KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED Address 801a8a83 has base at 80100000 -

Using the Emergency Repair Disk does not fix the problem, and your attempts to
replace registry hives from a parallel installation do not succeed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the SOFTWARE hive of the registry is corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, restore the SOFTWARE registry hive from a current tape
backup.
