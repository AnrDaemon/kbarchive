TITLE   :Error When Saving Routing & Remote Access Service Configuration
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service Update for Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to save your configuration in Routing and Remote Access Service
(RRAS) Administrator, you may receive the following error message:

   An error occurred while backing up the configuration: The network name cannot
   be found.

   If you are saving the configuration of a remote computer, then the directory
   and drive in which you are saving the configuration must exist on both the
   local and remote computers.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if the ADMIN$ administrative network share is not present
on your computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, re-share the %SystemRoot% folder (by default, the Winnt
folder) and name the share ADMIN$.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ADMIN$ administrative network share is created by default in all Microsoft
Windows NT installations.

To save the configuration, RRAS Administrator creates the following files:

   <Save_filename>Interfaces
   <Save_filename>Parameters
   <Save_filename>RouterManagers
   <Save_filename>Phonebook
   <Save_filename>.mpr

In the situation described in this article, only the first three files are
created.
