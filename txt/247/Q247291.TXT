TITLE   :XFOR: Migration Slow to Enumerate Names from a Large NAB
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you migrate from a Lotus Notes server that has a large Notes Address Book
(NAB), it may be 15 to 20 minutes before any data is migrated.

This is especially time consuming if you only need to migrate a small group of
users from that server.

CAUSE
=====

The migration program enumerates the entire NAB. The program builds a list of
all of the users on that server and then migrates the names that are provided by
either the Control file or the user selection.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This hotfix provides for the use of a Userlist in a control file that does not
enumerate the Notes Address Book (NAB). This Userlist is triggered using the
'Accounts' keyword in a Control file. If the user names are provided to the
migration program, the entire NAB is not generated into a migration list. This
faster method is only available from the Command Line migration.

NOTE: Q198957 also addresses the control file but it is missing information that
is better addressed by the above Q263755.
