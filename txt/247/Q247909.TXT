TITLE   :XCLN: From Box Pre-populated Replying to Mail on Shared Mailbox
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::; WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to reply to a message on a shared mailbox to which you have
been given Reviewer permissions, but not "Send on Behalf of" permissions, a
reply form opens with the From field pre-populated. When you click the Send
button, you receive the following error message:

   You do not have the permission to send the message on behalf of the specified
   user.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are two workarounds for this problem:

 - Request your Exchange Server administrator to give you "Send On Behalf Of"
   permissions on the shared mailbox.

 - When the reply form opens, delete name or names in the pre-populated From
   field, and then click Send.
