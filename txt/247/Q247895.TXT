TITLE   :MSMQ Reports Number of Licenses Exceeded in Windows NT Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Microsoft Message Queue Server (MSMQ) initiates a transfer session, you
may receive an error message stating that the number of client licenses has been
exceeded, and the transfer session does not take place. This may occur on a
computer running Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the Windows NT License Logging service is disabled
on either the local MSMQ Queue Manager computer that sends the error message or
the remote Queue Manager computer that receives it.

Establishing a message transfer session requires a Windows NT Server 4.0 client
access license. When the internal license limit has been reached or when no
Windows NT client access license is available, Queue Manager does not establish
the session.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, enable the License Logging Service in the Services
tool in Control Panel.
