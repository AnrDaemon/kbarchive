TITLE   :XADM: Error 1067 Occurs When Starting Directory Service After Re
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start the directory service in Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5
after restoring it from backup, the directory may not start and you may receive
the following error message:

   Error 1067. The process terminated unexpectedly.

The following events may appear in the Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 124
   Source: ESE97
   Description: MSExchangeDS ((1432 ) ) Unable to read the log header. Error
   -530.

   Event ID: 1196
   Source: MSExchangeDS
   Description: Couldn't recover the restored Microsoft Exchange Server database
   (EDB). Cannot continue. Error c8000212.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur on a recovery server or on a server you use for testing
purposes because the Edb.log file that is created during a restore operation
from backup interferes with the recovery process when the restore operation is
finished.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, manually remove the existing data in the Dsadata
folder before starting the restore operation from backup.

NOTE: If you delete the Edb.log file to restart the directory service, run
eseutil with the /g /v /x /ds options to ensure that this deletion does not
introduce errors into the directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To prevent this behavior in the future, use the setup /r command when you
perform the restore installation.
