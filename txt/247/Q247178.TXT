SYMPTOMS
========

Programs (such as Microsoft Internet Information Server) may stop responding
(hang) while they are attempting to gain access to files on a remote server.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT Redirector (Rdr.sys) may hang threads while trying to close a
file because of a problem in the cache manager. These threads wait for an event
that never happens.
