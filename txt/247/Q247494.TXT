TITLE   :BUG: Transform() Results Formatted Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp600 kbvfp600bug kbXBase kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbCodeSnippet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You might see that the results of the TRANSFORM() function appear off by
approximately .0000000000001. This behavior may occur when COMPATIBLE is OFF.
However, when COMPATIBLE is ON, the expected behavior is observed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Workaround
----------

Here are three ways to work around this behavior:

 - Use this code:

   SET COMPATIBLE ON

   -or-

 - Use this code:

   ALLTRIM(STR(<nExpr>, <nLength>, <nDecimalPlaces>))

   -or-

 - Use this code:

   SET DECIMALS TO <nDecimalPlaces>
   SET FIXED ON

NOTE: Setting the nDecimalPlaces to >= 15 for any work around results in an
overflow error.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The TRANSFORM function was modified to allow the developer to issue
Transform(<nExpr>) without a format or picture clause. The result is
similar to ALLTRIM(STR(<nExpr>, <nLength>,
<nDecimalPlaces>)).

How to Reproduce the Behavior
-----------------------------

Enter the following code in a program and run the program:

   CLEAR
   cCompatible = SET("COMPATIBLE")
   SET COMPATIBLE OFF
   ? "Precision automatically jumps to 15 decimal places "
   ? "with overflows displayed at 1.6"

   FOR i = 1 TO 3 STEP .1
   	? TRANSFORM(i)
   ENDFOR
   SET COMPATIBLE &cCompatible

The values should begin to miscalculate around the number 1.6.
