TITLE   :XFOR: Using DBCS with the Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you send a message from an Exchange Server user to a Lotus cc:Mail user
through the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail, when the messages
are received they may be unintelligible, or they may include corrupted
characters. If you inspect the sent message, you find that it includes
double-byte character set (DBCS) characters.

CAUSE
=====

You must define the language of the recipient cc:Mail post office on Exchange
Server and apply the particular language code page on the connector server and
on any additional servers that handle the DBCS messages. The code pages are
required for the messages to arrive at the cc:Mail destination mailbox in the
proper format.

RESOLUTION
==========

To change the post office language:

1. Start the Exchange Server Administrator Program, click the Configuration
   container, and then click Connections.

2. Double-click cc:Mail Connector.

3. Click the Post Office tab, and make sure that the value of the Post Office
   Language list reflects the language of the cc:Mail post office that you
   connect to.

MORE INFORMATION
================

English (US ASCII) characters still translate properly if a DBCS language is
defined in the post office property page.

Only one DBCS language post office can be selected for each Exchange Connector
for Lotus cc:Mail. If you need more than one DBCS post office language, you must
create a second Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail and configure it without a
second language.
