   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you access the Permissions tab by using the Exchange Server Administrator
program, the following error message is displayed:

   The specified domain did not exist.
   Microsoft Windows NT
   ID no: 0xc002054b

After you click OK, the Permissions tab has no information displayed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by an invalid domain entry in the CachePrimaryDomain
value in the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

You can also view this invalid entry by using the Exchange Server Administrator
program; on the Tools menu, click Options, click Permissions, and then click
"Default Windows NT domain".

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, you need to modify the registry key to reflect a valid
domain.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the CachePrimaryDomain value under the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. On the Edit menu, click String , type a valid Microsoft Windows NT domain
   name, and then click OK.

4. Quit the Registry Editor.

NOTE: If you change this entry by using the Exchange Server Administrator
program, you do NOT modify this registry entry. If you return to the Permissions
tab, the entry reverts to the invalid registry entry. You must modify the
registry value.
