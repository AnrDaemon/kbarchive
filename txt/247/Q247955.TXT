STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 SP1. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, use the appropriate method on the Systems Management
Server site server.

Method 1: Using the Hotfix Installer
------------------------------------

NOTE: You can use this method only on Intel-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a share on your network. Q247955.exe is
   an SMS Installer file that updates specific files on your site server.

2. Log on to your site server using an account with administrative privileges.

3. On the site server, quit the Systems Management Server Administrator console.

4. Run Q247955.exe and follow the directions in the wizard. You can run the file
   in Quiet mode by using the /s switch.

Method 2: Manual Installation
-----------------------------

1. Stop the SMS_EXECUTIVE and the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER services.

2. On the site server, quit the Systems Management Server Administrator console.

3. Replace the Remctrl.exe file in the
   <SMS_root>\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Remctrl\I386 folder with the version
   obtained from the hotfix.

4. Replace the Compver.ini file in the
   <SMS_root>\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Remctrl folder with the version obtained
   from the hotfix.

5. Replace Ldwmnt.dll file in the <SMS_root>\Bin\I386 folder with the
   version obtained from the hotfix.

6. Start the SMS_EXECUTIVE and the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER services.

NOTE: The default Client Configuration Installation Manager (CCIM) polling
interval is 23 hours. Therefore, it may take up to 23 hours for the hotfixed
files to be propagated to the clients. To speed up this process, you can create
a software distribution for the Setevnt.exe or Cliutils.exe Resource Kit tool,
along with the appropriate parameter(s) to start a CCIM work cycle. For
information about the proper syntax to use with these tools, see the Resource
Kit documentation.
