======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Microsoft Exchange Client, you may encounter the following
error message:

   Microsoft Exchange Error
   The command you specified could not be carried out. The object could not be
   found. Microsoft Windows Messaging System Forms Registry- [8004010F]

CAUSE
=====

The error message occurs under the following conditions.

You are using a system with Microsoft Exchange Client and then upgrade to Outlook
2000. Later, you uninstall Outlook 2000 and use the Exchange Client only. The
error message occurs because while you were uninstalling Outlook 2000, the
Frmcache.dat file that was in use with Outlook 2000 is not removed, and the
original Frmcache.bak file is not renamed Frmcache.dat. This causes the Exchange
Client to be unable to call correctly-cached messaging form information.

WORKAROUND
==========

After you uninstall Outlook 2000, do either of the following:

 - Rename the Frmcache.bak file to Frmcache.dat, then double-click the Mlset32
   file in the Program Files\Microsoft Exchange folder to reregister the
   Exchange Client in the registry.

-or-

 - Manually delete the Frmcache.dat file, and then reinstall the Exchange Client
   software from the original CD.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
