PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to test Post Office Protocol (POP3) on Microsoft Exchange
Server 5.5 through telnet, the connection may not succeed and the following
event may appear in the application log of Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 13003
   Source: MSExchangePOP3
   Type: Error
   Category: Authentication
   Description: Hr lookup credentials () call failed with error logon failure.
   Unknown user name or bad password.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when Exchange Server services, the Exchange service
account, or both lack the necessary permissions and rights.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, make sure that the Exchange service account has all
container level permissions and all necessary user rights in User Manager for
Domains. Also, make sure that all Exchange services start by using the service
account. Follow these steps:

1. In Exchange Administrator, make sure the Exchange service account has
   permissions at the site, configuration, and server levels.

2. In Control Panel, double-click Services and make sure all Exchange services
   start by using this account:

   a. Select an Exchange service, and then click Startup.

   b. Make sure that Log On As is selected, and that the Exchange service
      account is listed.

3. In User Manager for Domains, make sure that this account has the following
   user rights:

    - Act as part of the operating system

    - Log on as a service

    - Log on locally

    - Restore files and directories

4. Stop the information store, and then restart it.

5. To test the new configuration, use telnet to connect to port 110.
