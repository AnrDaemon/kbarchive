TITLE   :NET USER /DOMAIN Returns Incorrect Last User Logon
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the NET USER accountname /DOMAIN command to obtain the last logon
information for a user account, you may find that the information about the last
logon is incorrect.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because NET USER contacts only the primary domain
controller (PDC) for this information and therefore returns information only
about the latest PDC authentication of that user.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, use the Usrstat.exe command to obtain user logon
statistics.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Usrstat.exe contacts all domain controllers and returns the last-logon
information from each. You can compare the dates and times to determine the last
user logon. The Usrstat.exe tool is in the Windows NT Server 4.0 Resource Kit.

The NET USER command is designed to modify user accounts, not to return
statistics.
