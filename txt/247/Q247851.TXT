TITLE   :Problems with Logon Scripts if Exporting Server Is Not PDC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If Windows Networking Logon Client Installation or Windows Networking Logon
Discovery is enabled, and the "Modify user logon scripts" feature is enabled,
Systems Management Server "assumes" the script exporting server is the primary
domain controller (PDC). The SMS_NT_LOGON_SERVER_MANAGER writes the SMS logon
scripts to repl$\Scripts on the PDC, and then replicates them to the NETLOGON
shares on the PDC and BDC's. In environments that use the Windows NT Directory
Replicator service, and the PDC is not the script exporting server, the Systems
Management Server logon scripts may disappear or be overwritten.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the Windows NT Directory Replicator service is
copying files from a different replication source.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue and avoid these conflicts, either disable the Windows
NT Directory Replicator Service, or configure it so the script exporting server
is the PDC.
