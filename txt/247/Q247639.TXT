TITLE   :WD97: Err Msg: "Style Not Defined" with StyleRef Field
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta wd2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you use a STYLEREF field that references a style name, the following error
message may appear, rather than the correct style reference, if you open the
document in a different language version of Word.

   Error! Style not defined

The error may appear in the language of the version of Word that is in use. For
example, in the French version of Word, you may see the following:

   Erreur ! Style non defini

CAUSE
=====

The STYLEREF field references styles by name, and Word does not translate
built-in style names to the language in use.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do the following steps:

Change the StyleRef Field to Point to the Correct Style Name 
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Display field codes by pressing ALT+F9.

2. Change the reference to the correct name. For example, change STYLEREF "Titre
   1" to STYLEREF "Heading 1" if converting from French Word to English Word.

3. Press F9 to update the field.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
