The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use Microsoft Exchange Client version 4.0 or 5.0
(the Exchange client) to resolve issues with reminders that do not dismiss and
individual clients that are publishing incorrect free-and-busy times.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the Exchange Client to resolve issues that pertain to Outlook
clients such as reminders that do not dismiss and individual calendar or
free-and-busy issues. The exact location of this file varies depending on the
operating system. Typically, Exchng32.exe is located in the Windows Messaging
subfolder.

NOTE: The Exchange 32-bit client is not shipped with Outlook 2000.

Before you follow the procedure described in this section, try to start Outlook
by using the /cleanfreebusy or /cleanreminders switch to start to troubleshoot
these issues. If you start Outlook using the /cleanfreebusy or /cleanreminders
switch, and your issue is not resolved, follow these steps:

1. Start the Outlook client.

2. Click the user's calendar, click Import/Export on the File menu, and then
   export the Calendar folder to a personal folder.

3. On the File menu, click "Exit and Log off".

4. Start the Exchange Client.

5. Click the user's calendar, and then press DELETE.

6. Quit the Exchange Client.

7. Click Start, click Run, and then type the following command to restart
   Outlook:

   "outlook.exe /resetfolders" (without the quotation marks)

   NOTE: You notice that the user has an empty Calendar folder.

8. Click the user's Calendar folder, click Import/Export on the File menu, and
   then import the file that you saved in step two.

9. Verify that the calendar data is successfully imported into the Calendar
   folder, and then test to see if the issues with reminders or free-and-busy
   issues still occur.

NOTE: You cannot perform this procedure when you use an Outlook client because
Outlook does not allow you to delete default folders such as the Calendar
folder. You cannot perform this procedure on the Inbox because you cannot delete
the Inbox from either Outlook or Exchange client.
