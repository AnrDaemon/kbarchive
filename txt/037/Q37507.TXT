SYMPTOMS
========

When an application uses the scanf() function to read a floating-point value
from the console into an uninitialized "float" type global variable, an R6002
"floating-point format support not loaded" error occurs. This error also occurs
when any formatted input routine is used to read a value.

CAUSE
=====

The compiler does not generate a reference to the __fltused variable that
instructs the linker to load the floating-point support module.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, initialize the floating-point variable or use the
variable in an expression in the routine that contains the scanf() call.

STATUS
======

This behavior is expected. To minimize the size of the executable file, the
compiler loads floating-point support only when it is required.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a module uses only one of the formatted input routines and does not also
initialize a floating-point variable, the compiler does not load floating-point
support.

Remove the comment indication from either or both of the two lines in the sample
code below to eliminate the R6002 error.

Sample Code
-----------

      /*
       * Compile options needed: none
       */ 

      #include <stdio.h>
      float x ;

      main()
      {
      // Remove the comment from the next line to eliminate the error.
      // x = 2.3 ;

         scanf ("%f", &x) ;

      // Remove the comment from the next line to eliminate the error.
      // printf ("%f\n", x) ;
      }
