SUMMARY
=======

A domain error occurs when an application passes an invalid value to a function.
The "domain" of a function refers to its arguments; the "range" of a function
refers to the values it returns.

For example, if an application calls the sqrt() function with the argument -1, a
domain error occurs because -1 is not in the domain of the real number square
root function (that is, you can't take the square root of -1 and receive a real
result).

A domain error can also occur if an application calls a function with an
incorrect data type. (For example, if you call a function that expects a double
parameter with an int.) The compiler should produce warning messages or perform
the required conversion if you properly declare prototypes for each function
your application calls (perhaps by including the appropriate system header file,
such as MATH.H).

To avoid a domain error, verify that the value your application passes to a
function has the proper type and that the value is in the function's domain.
