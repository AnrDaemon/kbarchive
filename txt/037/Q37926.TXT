The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, MS-DOS workstation, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To use the MS-DOS print spooler (the PRINT command) with Microsoft Mail (MS- DOS
client), you must load the resident portion of the PRINT program before you run
the Notifier.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The PRINT command is a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program that may affect
the proper operation of the Notifier if it is loaded on top of the Notifier in
memory. To load the resident portion of the PRINT command, type "print" (without
the quotation marks) at the MS- DOS prompt. MS-DOS will display the following
prompt:

   Name of list device [PRN]:

If you receive the message "Bad command or file name," change to the directory
that contains the MS-DOS utilities, then retype "print" (without the quotation
marks). Type in the communications port to which your printing device is
attached (for example, LPT1:, LPT2:, COM1:) and press ENTER. MS-DOS will display
the following prompt:

   Resident part of PRINT installed
   Print queue is empty

You should now able to load the Notifier, run Mail, and, when necessary, use the
PRINT command from the MS-DOS prompt.
