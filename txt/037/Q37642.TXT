The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22

SUMMARY
=======

If you have two different, and possibly incompatible, floppy disk drive types,
you can use one floppy disk drive to copy a file between two floppy disks if you
install DRIVER.SYS with the appropriate switches in your CONFIG.SYS file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, if the line

   DEVICE=DRIVER.SYS /D:0 /F:1

is present in the CONFIG.SYS file, the following message is issued when the
driver is installed

   Loaded external disk driver for drive <x>

where <x> is the new logical drive letter associated with drive A. You can
then use the single floppy disk drive and the MS-DOS COPY command to copy files
between disks (swapping disks when prompted), as in the following example:

   copy a:one.txt x:

DRIVER.SYS is only needed if you have two different, and possibly incompatible,
floppy disk drive types; however, you still need to use two floppies of the same
media type (for example, 360K to 360K).

NOTE: If your PC machine has only one floppy drive, MS-DOS uses a similar method
and the B drive letter to allow you to copy files from floppy disk to floppy
disk. For example, the following COPY example accomplishes the same results:

   copy a:one.txt b:
