SUMMARY
=======

The system include files declare functions that use the C calling and naming
conventions with the attribute "cdecl".

The compiler uses the C calling and naming conventions by default unless the
compiler command line specifies the /Gc or /Gz option switches. The /Gc switch
instructs the compiler to use the Pascal (FORTRAN) calling convention by
default. The 32-bit compilers do not support the /Gc option switch; they use the
/Gz option switch that instructs the compiler to use the __stdcall calling and
naming convention by default.

The "cdecl" attribute instructs the compiler to generate run-time library calls
using the C calling and naming conventions even when the command line specifies
the /Gc or /Gz option.
