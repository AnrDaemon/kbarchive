SUMMARY
=======

RCData.exe is a sample that demonstrates how to use a user-defined resource in a
Windows-based application.

The resource is declared in the resource (RC) file as follows:

      TEST RCDATA
      BEGIN
          <data goes here>
      END

An application accesses this resource with the following statements:

      hFound = FindResource(hInstance, "TEST", RT_RCDATA);
      hRes = LoadResource(hInstance, hFound);
      lpBuff = LockResource(hRes);
      // use lpBuff to access the resource contents
      bResult = UnlockResource(hRes);
      bResult = FreeResource(hRes);
