The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, MS-DOS workstation, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Mail allows Macintosh and MS-DOS workstation users who are connected
to the AppleTalk network to communicate with each other through a Mail server on
a Macintosh. Because all mail messages are stored on the Macintosh server, large
amounts of disk storage area (other than the Macintosh server) are not necessary
on the workstations.

With the Microsoft Mail MS-DOS client, you can do the following:

 - Send and receive electronic messages

 - Send files created by other applications with your messages

 - Forward messages and files to other users

 - Save messages as text files that you can work with in text editor programs

 - Print messages directly from the Mail MS-DOS workstation to a local printer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The two main components of a Mail MS-DOS workstation are the Notifier and the
mailbox. The Notifier is a memory-resident program that allows you to run Mail
in the background while you run other applications. With the Notifier loaded in
memory, you can be alerted when new mail arrives in your mailbox through the
display of an alert window or an audible beep, or both.

The mailbox contains the messages and files you've received from other mail
users. These messages and files are stored on the Macintosh server. When you
open your mailbox, the server transfers the messages and files to your MS-DOS
workstation computer. When you send messages and files to another user, they are
deposited in the user's mailbox on the server.
