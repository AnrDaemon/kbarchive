PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For Appletalk Networks

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, MS-DOS workstation, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To use the TOPS AppleTalk network software provided with the TOPS FlashCard for
the PC, you must turn off the Microsoft Mail (MS-DOS client) Notifier. You can
do this by typing "notifier off" (without quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt
or by choosing Exit And Sign Out from the File menu. If the Notifier is started
automatically in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, make sure the NOTIFIER ON command
follows any commands that load the TOPS memory-resident software.

If you have already installed the Notifier to run Mail, and you want to install
the TOPS software, you must turn off the Notifier before installing the TOPS
software. After you install the TOPS software, reinstall the Notifier by typing
"notifier on" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt, then enter
your mail user name and password when prompted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The TOPS FlashCard for the PC comes with additional software that allows you to
set up your PC as a TOPS server. This software allows you to designate
directories on your hard disk for use on the network (called "volumes") when you
run the TOPS network software and then make these directories accessible to TOPS
network users (called "publishing" a volume). Other TOPS network users can then
access the files in the directory (called "mounting" a published volume).

To acquire these capabilities, you must run two programs: TOPSTALK.EXE and
TOPSKRNL.EXE. TOPS recommends that you install the TOPS software before you
install any other memory-resident software. Attempting to run the TOPS software
with the Notifier loaded in memory may disable the TOPS software or lock up the
system.

TOPS FlashCard for the PC is manufactured by Sun Microsystems, Inc., a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this product's performance or reliability.
