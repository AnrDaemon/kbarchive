-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

IMPORTANT: All Microsoft Mail version 2.00 customers who have gateways installed
should be using the "MS Mail GW" file version 2.00b and the "Microsoft Mail
Server" file version 2.00b, both of which are located in the System Folder of
the Mail server. An updated "MS Mail GW" file is available through Microsoft End
User Sales and Service at (800) 426-9400 or Microsoft International Customer
Service at (206) 936-9661, but ONLY for customers using the AppleLink Gateway to
Microsoft Mail. Customers using other gateways must obtain an updated "MS Mail
GW" file from the developer of the gateway they are using. The Microsoft Mail
server upgrade can also be obtained at the above numbers.


MORE INFORMATION
================

When starting the AppleLink Comm program, you will receive the following error
message if the file "MS Mail GW" is not in the System Folder of the Macintosh
acting as the gateway Mail server:

Unable to launch application for the following reason: Gateway Services not
present. Check to see if MS Mail GW is in your System Folder.

The only option is to click the OK button.

To correct this problem, copy the file "MS Mail GW" from the Gateway For
AppleLink disk into the System Folder of the gateway server and restart.

After restarting the server, do the following:

1. From the Apple menu, choose the Chooser.

2. Click the icon for MS Mail GW.

3. Select the name of the gateway server and close the Chooser.

When running the AppleLink gateway, the AppleLink Comm program should be set as a
start-up application.
