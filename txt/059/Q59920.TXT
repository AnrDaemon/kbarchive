SUMMARY
=======

GetMessage reads from the Microsoft Mail server the contents of the message
specified by the "type" and "ID" arguments. The syntax for GetMessage in Mail
2.00 is as follows:

      msmail(GetMessage, type, ID) => messageRef

The syntax for GetMessage in Microsoft Mail version 3.00 has the additional,
optional argument of "FolderRef":

      msmail(GetMessage, type, ID[, FolderRef]) => messageRef

"type" is a 4-character message type, such as "Mess" for Note, or "Mesp" for
Phone message types.

"ID" is a specific message number returned by the getMessageListField command.

"FolderRef" is a reference to the folder the message is contained in. If this
argument is omitted, then the current folder is used. This argument applies only
in Mail 3.00.

This information is taken from the "Microsoft Mail HyperCard Interface
Documentation."
