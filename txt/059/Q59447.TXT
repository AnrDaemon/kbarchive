SUMMARY
=======

After you compose a Microsoft Mail message on a Macintosh Portable and click the
Send button, a dialog box may come up saying "The message was not sent
(communication error or disk full). Please check and try again." To successfully
send the message, open and close the Chooser.

When the Macintosh Portable goes into Sleep mode, the machine deactivates some
network services. If you use the Battery desk accessory to go immediately into
Sleep mode, the machine displays the following warning:

   Putting the computer to sleep may cause you to lose some network services.
   Check your connections in the Chooser next time you wake the computer.
