Service at (206) 936-8661 but ONLY for customers using the AppleLink Gateway to

server upgrade can also be obtained at the above numbers.


MORE INFORMATION
================

To send an AppleLink mail message to a recipient on AppleLink, the following
must be true:

1. You must have a Microsoft Mail account on an AppleLink gateway server or an
   AppleLink gateway-access server.

2. The Network Manager of the gateway server must give your Mail account access
   to an AppleLink account. This is done in the Define Gateway Accounts window.

To send an AppleLink mail message to a recipient on AppleLink, do the followi

1. Select the AppleLink Send form or the 80 Column form if using Mail 3.00. You
   can use any of the forms, but the AppleLink form and 80 Column form are 80
   characters wide in 9-point Monaco, which is compatible with AppleLink.

2. Create the subject and body of the Mail message as you would in a normal Mail
   message.

3. Click the Address Mail button to bring up the Address Mail window.

4. In the All list of recipients, select the AppleLink recipient, if the
   recipient has been defined by the Network Manager of the gateway server. If
   the AppleLink recipient has not been defined, click the AppleLink icon and
   enter the information for the fields "Recipient Name" and "AppleLink Address"
   in the address box that pops up. Click the Add button to add this recipient
   to the list of Message Recipients. Repeat this step as many times as
   necessary.

5. Click the Close button when done adding message recipients.

6. Click the Send button to send the Mail message.

Please note that when an AppleLink mail message is actually sent through the
gateway depends on the connect times set in the Gateway Connect Times window.
