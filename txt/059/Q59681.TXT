======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you type characters on the keyboard immediately after exiting Microsoft
Windows 3.0 in enhanced mode, it may take 20-30 seconds to return to the MS- DOS
prompt and the computer may seem to stop responding (hang).

Similar behavior may occur with Windows 3.1, if the keyboard buffer gets filled
(beeping occurs) while Windows is exiting.

Sometimes, the shift state gets toggled incorrectly, so that the keyboard behaves
as if the CTRL, ALT, or SHIFT key were being held down. Pressing the appropriate
key a few times typically resets the state correctly.

Sometimes, the computer simply hangs, requiring a cold boot.

WORKAROUND
==========

Avoid typing characters while enhanced mode Windows is exiting; wait until the
MS-DOS prompt appears.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows versions 3.0
and 3.1. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
