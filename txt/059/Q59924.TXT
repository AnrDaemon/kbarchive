SUMMARY
=======

To display a Microsoft Mail Message Center similar to the one used in Microsoft
Word and Microsoft Excel, use the following command with Microsoft Mail version
2.0:

      msmail (displayMessageCenter [, typeFilter] [, subjectFilter]
      [, enclosureFilter]) => messageList

With Microsoft Mail version 3.0, the command has an additional parameter:

      msmail(DisplayMessageCenter [, typeFilter][, subjectFilter]
      [, enclosureFilter][, buttonTitle]

This function allows you interactively browse through and delete messages, and
select one or several messages. A list of the selected messages is returned in
"messageList" if you click OK. If you click Cancel, a message list is returned,
but the messagecount is zero. NOTE: The "Microsoft Mail HyperCard Interface
Documentation" stack incorrectly states on the card describing the
DisplayMessageCenter command that "empty" is returned if Cancel is clicked.

"typeFilter" is a single message type to be returned. For example, "Mess" would
display only Note messages.

"subjectFilter" specifies the exact subject a message must have. An empty string
"" matches all messages.

"enclosureFilter" specifies the type(s) of enclosure a message must have. For
example, "TEXTWDBN" would display messages containing text or Microsoft Word
files.

"buttonTitle" specifies the name of the action button, and it defaults to
"Open".

For a description of the format of messageList, see getMessageList in the
documentation. Note that in Mail 3.0 you cannot move messages from one folder to
another, except when deleting files.

Note: This command in Mail 2.0 is not compatible with HyperCard version 2.0.
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Mail 2.0. This problem was
corrected in Mail 3.0.

This information is taken from the "Microsoft Mail HyperCard Interface
Documentation."
