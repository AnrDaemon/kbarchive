SUMMARY
=======

getMacResource retrieves the Macintosh resource with the given type, name, and
ID and returns it in a handle. The syntax for getMacResource is as follows:

      msmail(getMacResource, type, name, ID)=>handle

Either the name or ID parameters may be empty, but not both. Here are some
examples of legitimate parameters:

      put msmail(getMacResource, "snd ","","Simple Beep") into hndl
      put msmail(getMacResource, "PICT", 4007) into hndl

getMacResource looks first in the resource fork of the current stack, then in
HyperCard's resources, and finally in the System resources. The name and ID of a
resource can be found with the ResEdit program from Apple. Note that if the ID
is empty, a placeholder ("") must be used.

When you are done using the handle, you should dispose of its contents with
disposeHandle.

The "type" parameter lets users specify the 4-character type of the resource to
be added, such as "ICON", "CODE", or "snd ".

Documentation."
