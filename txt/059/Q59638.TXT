======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Valid timeslice values for the 386 enhanced mode section of the Control Panel
are 1 to 10,000. However, the Control Panel allows you to enter invalid values
without producing an error message.

The minimum timeslice may be set manually by keying a number directly, instead of
using the arrow buttons, to 99,999. Windows truncates this number to 9,999 and
does not return an error message. If the arrow buttons are used to increase the
timeslice setting, it goes no higher than 1,000.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.0. This
problem does not occur in later versions of Windows or in Windows for
Workgroups.

Additional query words: 3.0 3.00 time slice
