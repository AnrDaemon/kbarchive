SUMMARY
=======

The Form Template stack on the Microsoft Mail Utilities disk provides template
cards for each of the components of a custom form (Send screen, Read screen,
icons, printed form). The template cards contain the objects you manipulate to
create a custom form. This file is a HyperCard stack.

When creating a custom form, the Form Designer script automatically opens this
template.
