-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Microsoft Windows 3.0 in a directory with an extension, such as
C:\HOME.DIR, Windows Setup does not add the directory to your path.

WORKAROUND
==========

You have the option of manually adding the directory to your path, but we do not
recommend installing Windows 3.0 in a directory with an extension. Many
applications do not correctly handle such a directory and may not function
properly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.00. This
problem does not occur in later versions of the product.

Additional query words: 3.00 win30
