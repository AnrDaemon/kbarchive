The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0b, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

IMPORTANT: All Microsoft Mail version 2.00 customers who have gateways installed
should be using the "MS Mail GW" file version 2.00b and the "Microsoft Mail
Server" file version 2.00b, both of which are located in the System Folder of
the Mail server. An updated "MS Mail GW" file is available through Microsoft End
User Sales and Service at (800) 426-9400 or Microsoft International Customer
Service at (206) 936-8661 but ONLY for customers using the AppleLink Gateway to
Microsoft Mail. Customers using other gateways must obtain an updated "MS Mail
GW" file from the developer of the gateway they are using. The Microsoft Mail
server upgrade can also be obtained at the above numbers.


MORE INFORMATION
================

For multiple Mail users to receive incoming mail for a gateway account, these
users must be defined as a Microsoft Mail group. To make this group the "default
user," do the following:

1. In the Define Gateway Accounts window, after you have filled in the other
   appropriate gateway account information, click the Add Users button.

2. Select and add the users that you want to be able to send Mail through the
   gateway. Also add the group that includes all the users that you want to
   receive the incoming gateway mail.

3. Click the Close button when done to return to the Define Gateway Accounts
   window.

4. In the list of gateway users, click the name of the group that includes all
   the users that you want to receive the incoming gateway mail. This
   highlighted group or user is called the "default user."

5. Click the Define button.

Now all incoming gateway mail for this account will be received by everyone in
the default user group.
