The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0b, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

IMPORTANT: All Microsoft Mail version 2.0 customers who have gateways installed
should be using the MS Mail GW file version 2.0b and the Microsoft Mail Server
file version 2.0b, both of which are located in the System Folder of the Mail
server. An updated MS Mail GW file is available Microsoft Product Support
Services, but ONLY for customers using the AppleLink Gateway to Microsoft Mail.
Customers using other gateways must obtain an updated MS Mail GW file from the
developer of the gateway they are using. The Microsoft Mail server upgrade can
also be obtained at the above numbers.

The release of Microsoft Mail 2.0b focused on the added voice messaging
capabilities. Customers were not automatically notified about the 2.0b release
because the problems addressed by 2.0b were not common or severe. For a
description of gateway corrections included in 2.0b, see the ReadMe file on the
Microsoft Mail 2.0b Update Disk or query on the following words:

   " readme and 2.00b " (without the quotation marks)

The following is an example of what an AppleLink message looks like when read by
a user on AppleLink. This message was sent from John Doe, AppleLink address
D9999, to Jane Doe, AppleLink address Jane.Doe.
