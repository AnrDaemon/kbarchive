SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using a PS/2 Mouse Port style mouse, you may experience a five- to
six-second delay switching between MS-DOS applications in real or standard mode
in Microsoft Windows 3.0.

NOTE: This occurs not only on genuine PS/2 machines, but on any machine with a
PS/2-style mouse port, such as the COMPAQ 386S and 20e.

CAUSE
=====

This delay is caused by the presence of an MS-DOS mouse driver. The MS-DOS mouse
driver reinitializes the mouse port with each ALT+TAB, thus causing the delay.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you can do without a mouse driver for your MS-DOS applications, this increase
task switching considerably on this type of machine.
