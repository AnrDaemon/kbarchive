SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit (SDK) for HyperCard uses two
HyperCard global variables to report the results of the msmail external function
call. These variables are as follows:

   mailResult
   mailResultText

The HyperCard global mailResult holds a number that is the return code of the
last call made to msmail. This is zero if the call succeeded. If an error
occurred, the HyperCard global mailResultText contains a textual description of
the error. If no error has occurred, mailResultText contains "No Error."

Global variables are used by declaring them as globals in the script with the
Global command. For example:

      on mouseup
         global mailResult, mailResultText
         put msmail(CreateMessage) into msref
         if mailresult <> 0 then
            answer "Error: " & mailResultText
            exit mouseup
         end if
         ....

If a call to the server is not successful, these functions are the only way to
find out that there has been an error. They are very useful in debugging and in
making a stack "bullet-proof" in operation.

This information is taken from the "Microsoft Mail HyperCard Interface
Documentation."
