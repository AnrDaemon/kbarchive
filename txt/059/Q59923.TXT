SUMMARY
=======

The msmail function parameter "addRecipients" adds the users whose names are
passed in "users" to the list of recipients for the message "messageRef". The
syntax of the command is as follows:

      msmail(AddRecipients, messageRef, users) => unknownUsers

There are two valid formats for a user name in "users", as follows:

   Unique Mail name:          Jane User
   Fully extended name:       Jane User@Accounting Server

In both cases, the components of the name must be given in full. Thus even if
"Jane User" were the only person whose name began with "Jane," "Jane" would fail
to match it, and "Jane User@Accounting" would fail to match the above fully
extended name. To add a recipient from an address book in Microsoft Mail version
3.00, put a double "@" sign after the name, as follows:

      put msmail(AddRecipients, messRef, "Carpool@@") into Unknown

You can add carbon copy or blind carbon copy recipients by prepending "Cc:" or
"Bcc:" onto the recipient names. Therefore, adding "Cc:Jane User" adds this user
as a carbon-copy recipient.

"messageRef" is a reference to a selected message obtained by making a call to
the msmail function using a parameter that returns a message reference.

Any users who cannot be found will be returned in the list "unknownUsers". This
list is delimited by returns with one user name on each line.

This information is taken from the "Microsoft Mail HyperCard Interface
Documentation."
