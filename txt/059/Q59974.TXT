SUMMARY
=======

To return a list of recipients for a Microsoft Mail message (with one name per
line followed by a return), use the following command:

      msmail(GetRecipients, messageRef [, extended]) => data

Carbon copy recipients will have "Cc:" prepended to their names. If "extended" is
"true" (the default), the names are returned in the following form:

   userName@serverName or
   Cc:userName@serverName

It is not possible to get a recipient that was blind carbon copied (bcc). That
information is not included with the message. This is true even in the Sent Mail
folder in Mail version 3.00.

This information is taken from the "Microsoft Mail HyperCard Interface
Documentation."
