SUMMARY
=======

If a Microsoft Mail workstation is installed on a Macintosh Portable and you are
signed into a local network, the automatic sleep mode of the Portable will
display the following message:

   Putting the computer to sleep may cause you to lose some network services.
   Check your connections in the Chooser next time you wake the computer.

If you click OK at this point, the connection to Mail is cut off and you have to
reselect Mail in the Chooser. Clicking Cancel leaves the connection to Mail
intact.
