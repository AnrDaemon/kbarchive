When using the NMAKE /D and /C switches together, the modification date of each
file will not be displayed when the date is checked. A short description of each
switch is described as follows:

   /D Displays the modification date of each file when the date is checked.

   /C Suppresses the NMAKE copyright message and prevents nonfatal error or
   warning messages from being displayed.

1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.2, 1.21, 1.3, and 1.4 for MS-DOS and versions 1.11, 1.12,
