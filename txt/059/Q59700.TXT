The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you run a TSR (terminate and stay resident) program, such as SideKick,
in an MS-DOS virtual machine under Microsoft Windows version 3.0 enhanced
mode and then unload the TSR and exit the virtual machine, you continue to
receive the "Windows TSR Support" message even though the TSR has been
unloaded.

This is because although there is a mechanism for Windows to determine if a
TSR has been loaded, there is no way for Windows to tell if the TSR has
been unloaded. Once it is loaded, a flag is set that a TSR is present.
Thus, you receive the TSR support message even if you have unloaded the TSR
manually.
