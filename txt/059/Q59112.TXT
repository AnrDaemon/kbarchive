SUMMARY

When creating a Microsoft Mail custom form, the compiler in the Form Designer
adds a scroll bar to all unlocked rectangular fields that contain more than 1
line. If the field is locked, the compiler does not add a scroll bar. If the
field contains only a single line, the compiler does not add a scroll bar
whether or not the field is locked.
