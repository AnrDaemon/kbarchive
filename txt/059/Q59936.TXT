TITLE   :PRB: L4047 Warning Benign When C 6 Run-time Libraries Used
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.1,5.11,5.13,5.15,5.2; OS/2:5.1,5.11,5.13,5.15

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS, versions 5.1, 5.11, 5.13, 5.15, 5.2 
 - Microsoft LINK for OS/2, versions 5.1, 5.11, 5.13, 5.15 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft LINK generates the following message when it links an application:

   L4047 - Multiple code segments in module of overlaid program incompatible
   with /CO

CAUSE
=====

The application includes the start-up code from the Microsoft C version 6.0
run-time libraries. This code includes a second segment to hold floating-point
math routines. Because this segment (EMULATOR_TEXT) does not contain any
CodeView information, it may be an error, as LINK indicates.

RESOLUTION
==========

This warning is expected in this situation and can be ignored. Microsoft LINK
versions 5.3 and later do not generate this message.

Additional query words: 5.10 5.11 5.13 5.15 5.20
