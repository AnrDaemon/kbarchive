SUMMARY
=======

When getMessage is called, a block of memory is allocated and the message is
read from the server. When you have finished reading fields from the message,
you must call disposeMessage to release this memory. This does NOT delete the
message from the mail server.

Additionally, when a message is created, memory is allocated for it, and released
automatically when the message is sent. If the message is not sent, then
disposeMessage should be called to release that memory.

      msmail (disposeMessage, messageRef)

For related functions, query on the following words:
