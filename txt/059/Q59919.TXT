SUMMARY
=======

The command "disposeMessageList" releases all the storage space that was used to
hold the message list in memory. This command is used as follows:

      msmail(disposeMessageList, messageList)

A message list is a handle and ties up memory on the server. When the message
list is no longer useful, disposeMessageList should be called.

This information is taken from the "Microsoft Mail HyperCard Interface
Documentation."
