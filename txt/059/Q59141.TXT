You can access environment variables within a MAKE or NMAKE makefile
in the same way that you access user-defined macros. The only
difference is that the names of environment variables must be
capitalized when used in this manner. For example:

   # the INCLUDE "macro" will pick up your INCLUDE environment variable

   file.obj : file.c $(INCLUDE)\file.h

   cl /c /Zi /Od file.c

Additional query words: kbinf 1.10 1.20 1.30 1.40 1.50
