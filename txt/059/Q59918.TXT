SUMMARY
=======

When using the "addRecipients" parameter to the msmail function call, it is
possible to add a list of recipients with one call.

To do this, place all the recipients in a HyperCard container, such as a field or
a variable, then pass the name of that container in the function call. The
recipients' names must be separated by return characters or each recipient must
be on a separate line.

For example, if the HyperCard container "mailUsers" contains the following names

   Jane Doe
   John Doe
   Jill Smith
   Jack Smith

then the function call would be as follows:

      get msmail(addRecipients,messageRef,mailUsers)

"messageRef" is a reference to a selected message obtained by making a call to
the msmail function using a parameter that returns a message reference.

For more information, see "addRecipients" in the "Microsoft Mail HyperCard
Interface Documentation."
