SUMMARY
=======

The Kraft two-port, multispeed Programmable Joystick Adapter Card is a
software-programmable card that allows you to match the clock speed of the IBM
PC, XT, AT, the IBM PS/2 Models 25 and 30, or any IBM-compatible computer. The
card is not compatible with the Tandy 1000 series of computers or with any Micro
Channel computer, specifically the IBM PS/2 Models 50, 60, 70, and 80. The
programmable software allows you to select clock speeds from 4.77 to 25 MHz.

The following two utility programs are provided with the Kraft adapter card:

KTEST.EXE  This program allows you to determine the optimum speed
           setting for the Kraft adapter card.

KCARD.EXE  This program allows you to define the speed setting for the
           Kraft adapter card.
