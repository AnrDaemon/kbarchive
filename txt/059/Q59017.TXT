SUMMARY
=======

Problem:

I used special software to set my EGA/VGA display to 43 or 50 line mode under
MS-DOS Packaged Product Versions 3.20, 3.21, 3.30, and 3.30a. Now, the PRINT
SCREEN key only prints 25 lines of the screen, and seems to ignore the remaining
18 or 25 lines, respectively.

Response:

This is not a problem with the MS-DOS Packaged Product Versions 3.2x and 3.3x.
Because the ANSI.SYS driver for versions prior to MS-DOS Packaged Product
Version 4.00 does not support more than 25 lines on a display, the PRINT SCREEN
key does not print more than 25 lines of text.

The MS-DOS Packaged Product Versions 4.00 and 4.01 ANSI.SYS drivers support 25,
43, and 50 line modes (see Page 100 of the "MS-DOS User's Reference"). For these
versions, the PRINT SCREEN key will print up to 50 lines of text, depending upon
the display mode.

Additional query words: 3.20 3.21 3.30 3.30a noupd
