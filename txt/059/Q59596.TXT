SUMMARY
=======

IMPORTANT: All Microsoft Mail version 2.00 customers who have gateways installed
should be using the "MS Mail GW" file version 2.00b and the "Microsoft Mail
Server" file version 2.00b, both of which are located in the System Folder of
the Mail server. An updated "MS Mail GW" file is available through Microsoft End
User Sales and Service at (800) 426-9400 or Microsoft International Customer
Service at (206) 936-8661 but ONLY for customers using the AppleLink Gateway to
Microsoft Mail. Customers using other gateways must obtain an updated "MS Mail
GW" file from the developer of the gateway they are using. The Microsoft Mail
server upgrade can also be obtained at the above numbers.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The AppleLink Comm program connects with AppleLink to upload and download mail
for the AppleLink gateway. When the AppleLink Comm program connects with
AppleLink, it makes one phone call to upload and download mail messages for all
gateway accounts while connected. Additional phone calls to reestablish contact
with AppleLink may be required if the connection is broken because of static or
interference on the phone lines.
