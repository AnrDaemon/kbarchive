TITLE   :ISAMCVT.EXE Fails to Convert db/LIB File, Try Packing First
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::1.0,7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic for MS-DOS 1.0 
 - Microsoft Basic Professional Development System for MS-DOS, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A customer reported that when converting db/LIB (dBASE) files to Microsoft
Visual Basic for MS-DOS, version 1.0 or Microsoft Basic Professional Development
System (PDS) for MS-DOS, version 7.0 ISAM files with the ISAMCVT.EXE utility,
the ISAM files are not created correctly if the db/LIB file contains logically
deleted records. For the process to be successful, the logically deleted records
must be physically removed from the file. According to the customer, db/LIB
provides a packing feature to do this.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The utility ISAMCVT.EXE is used to convert other types of indexed files to
Basic's ISAM format. One of these types is db/LIB. A customer reported that if
the db/LIB file to be converted has records in it that are marked for deletion,
ISAMCVT.EXE either produces a corrupted ISAM file or does not produce one at
all.

Packing an indexed file is a method of physically removing records that are
marked for deletion. The utility ISAMPACK.EXE is used to perform this function
on Basic's ISAM files. According to the customer, using a similar utility on a
db/LIB file that has records marked for deletion allows ISAMCVT.EXE to
successfully convert the file to the ISAM format.

Microsoft has not verified this information, but it is recommended to pack all
data files before they are converted to Microsoft Visual Basic for MS-DOS or
Microsoft Basic PDS ISAM with the ISAMCVT.EXE utility.
