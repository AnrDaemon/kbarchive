TITLE   :PRB: L2029: Unresolved External ___aDBswpchk with GRAPHICS.LIB
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::5.0,5.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN compiler for OS/2, versions 5.0, 5.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Linking with GRAPHICS.LIB in OS/2 may give the following error message:

   d:\lib\GRAPHICS.LIB(..\gr\qeswap.asm) : error L2029 :
   '___aDBswpchk' : unresolved external

CAUSE
=====

This is because GRAPHICS.LIB is designed for MS-DOS and is being linked with a
protected-mode FORTRAN library, which does not include the external references
required by GRAPHICS.LIB.

RESOLUTION
==========

Link with the real-mode library to correct the problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, the following sample programs included with FORTRAN produce this
error if linked under OS/2:

   MAGNIFY.FOR
   COLOR.FOR
   TEXT.FOR
   ANIMATE.FOR
   EGA.FOR

Additional query words: 5.00 5.10
