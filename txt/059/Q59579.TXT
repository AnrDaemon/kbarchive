SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the reasons why you may be unable to switch from a
non-Windows application in standard mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An inability to switch from a non-Windows application in standard mode can occur
for any of the following reasons:

 - One or more of the Directly Modifies options is set in the PIF file for the
   application.

 - The application is trapping all keyboard input. The application must be
   closed to switch back to Windows.

 - The Prevent Program Switch option is selected in the PIF file for the
   application.

 - Shortcut keys normally used by Windows, such as ALT+TAB, are reserved for use
   by the application in the PIF file.

 - The wrong video mode is incorrectly selected in the PIF file.

 - Your video display is an EGA, and the driver EGA.COM is improperly installed
   in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Ensure that the file EGA.COM resides in the Windows
   system directory.

 - The non-Windows application is using a video mode that is not supported
   currently under Windows; therefore, Windows cannot save or restore the
   display when switching.
