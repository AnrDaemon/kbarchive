SUMMARY

When you sign into a Microsoft Mail server, the username is not case sensitive,

The username can be typed in either uppercase or lowercase letters. The password
must be typed in exactly the same case as it was when it was set. Check the
status of the CAPS LOCK key if the password is not accepted.
