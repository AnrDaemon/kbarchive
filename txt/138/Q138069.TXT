SUMMARY
=======

The standard Visual Basic Objects like the App object, the Printer Object, the
Clipboard Object, the Screen Object, and the Forms Collection Object are all
implemented as methods of the master object called Global. There is very seldom
a need to use the object Global.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because the name of this master object conflicts with the Visual Basic Global
keyword, you must enclose it in square brackets when you use it. This object
also appears in the Object Browser under the Visual Basic Library. Here's an
Example:

      Dim x As [Global].Forms
      Debug.print x.Count

NOTE: The object Global is special in that it is a VTable only object; in other
words, you can't do the following:

      Dim x As Object
      Set x = [Global]
