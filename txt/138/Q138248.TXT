TITLE   :Instsupp.bat File Does Not Install Restore.exe Properly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run the Instsupp.bat file to install the supplemental MS-DOS tools
located in the Other\Oldmsdos folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM, you may receive
the following error message when you try to run the Restore.exe program:

   Incorrect DOS version

You may also receive this error message when you try to run other MS-DOS tools.

CAUSE
=====

When you install Windows 95, Setup updates the version table to include several
commonly used MS-DOS tools. The version of MS-DOS that Setup indicates should be
reported to these tools is the version of MS-DOS that is running when you
install Windows 95.

If you install Windows 95 on a computer that is already running Windows 95, the
version table is updated to report MS-DOS version 7.0 to MS-DOS tools. This
prevents tools that require MS-DOS 6.22 from running.

The Instsupp.bat file prevents this problem by copying MS-DOS tools from the
Windows 95 CD-ROM and then updating the version table to report the appropriate
version of MS-DOS to the tools. However, the Instsupp.bat file does not update
the version table for the Restore.exe program.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, update the version table for the Restore.exe
program. To do so, type the following line at an MS-DOS prompt, and then restart
your computer:

   setver restore.exe 6.22

You can use this method to update the version table for any MS-DOS tool. Use the
following syntax

   setver <program name> <MS-DOS version>

where <program name> is the name of the program file you want to run, and
<MS-DOS version> is the version number of MS-DOS that should be reported
to the program. Remember to restart your computer after updating the version
table.

If you reinstall Windows 95 or run the Instsupp.bat file after you update the
version table, you may need to update the table again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows 95 Setup program updates the version table to include the following
MS-DOS tools:

 - Append.exe

 - Basic.com

 - Basica.com

 - Diskcomp.com

 - Extdisk.exe

 - Graphics.com

 - Fastopen.exe

 - Mode_dos.com

 - Print.exe

 - Replace.exe

 - Restore.exe

 - Scplus.exe

 - Scsic710.sys

 - Tree.com

 - Vdisk.sys

The Append.exe, Graphics.com, Print.exe, Replace.exe, and Tree.com files are
located in the Other\Oldmsdos folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM, and should be
installed by running the Instsupp.bat file found in that folder. When you
install these tools with the Instsupp.bat file, the problem discussed in this
article does not occur.

The Basic.com, Basica.com, Diskcomp.com, Extdisk.exe, Fastopen.exe, Mode_dos.com,
Scplus.exe, Scsic710.sys, and Vdisk.sys files are not located in the
Other\Oldmsdos folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM. To run these tools, you must
copy or expand them from your original MS-DOS Setup disks, or run them from the
MS-DOS folder on your hard disk. When you try to run these tools, the problem
discussed in this article may occur.

NOTE: Before using the MS-DOS tools discussed in this article, please see the
Lfnbk.txt file in the Admin\Apptools\Lfnback folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM, or
