The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0

SUMMARY
=======

When you resize an application's window, a form in the application window is not
resized accordingly. To resize a form relative to the size of the application
window, you can use a timer control.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a new form.

2. Add two new properties called OldWidth and OldHeight. To do this, on the Form
   menu, click New Property.

3. In the Init event of the form, place this code:

      THISFORM.oldwidth  =  _SCREEN.width
      THISFORM.oldheight =  _SCREEN.height

4. Add a timer control to the form.

5. In the Timer event of the Timer control, place this code:

      x=_SCREEN.width
      y=_SCREEN.height
      IF ((x!=THISFORM.oldwidth) or (y!=THISFORM.oldheight))
         THIS.parent.width=_SCREEN.width-25
         THIS.parent.height=_SCREEN.height-25
         THISFORM.oldwidth  =  _SCREEN.width
         THISFORM.oldheight =  _SCREEN.height
         THISFORM.AutoCenter=.t.
         THISFORM.Refresh
      ENDIF

6. Change the Interval property of the Timer control to 100.

7. Run the form. Notice how when you resize the main application window, the
   form is automatically resized.
