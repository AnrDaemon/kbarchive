SYMPTOMS
========

On symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) configurations using the Thomas Conrad Arcnet
driver included with Windows NT a STOP message appears with a Trap 0x0000000A,
or your system appears to hang. The following is a stack trace for one of the
processors:

CAUSE
=====

Both processors have code paths that try to modify the list of received packets
at the same time causing the list to get corrupted.

The TCARC.SYS driver contains a list of received packets that is modified by the
TcarcEnqueueReceives routine. When a packet is received in an SMP computer, the
TcarcEnqueueReceives routine gets called by the TcarcIsr routine on one
processor and the TcarcDpc routine on a second processor at the same time.

If the list corruption results in a non-NULL-terminated list the server does not
trap but appears to hang. However, technically the server is not hung but is
caught in a loop because the TcarcDpc routine continues to indicate packets in
the corrupted, non-NULL-terminated, received-packets list because it never
encounters a NULL.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
