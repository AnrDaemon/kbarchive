PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Many large programs that use multiple processors, such as SQL Server for Windows
NT, stop responding (hang) intermittently after you upgrade the Dell XE 5100-2
computer from one processor to multiple processors.

CAUSE
=====

You still have the single processor hardware abstraction layer (HAL) file
installed under Windows NT.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, upgrade your computer to "MPS Multiprocessor PC" HAL by
running the Windows NT Resource Kit 3.5 UPTOMP.EXE utility. If you do not have
the Windows NT 3.5 Resource Kit, you may download UP_TO_MP.EXE from the Dell
Bulletin Board Service (BBS) at (512) 728-8528. For additional information,
contact Dell Technical Support at (800) 624-9896.
