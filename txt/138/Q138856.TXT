TITLE   :Error 4119 when Selecting SNA Server Admin Security Options
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you select any of the options under SNA Server Admin Security the following
error message appears:

   Error: 4119
   Cannot find or connect to the primary SNA server to support your
   request.

Note: The three selections on SNA Server Admin Security menu are Permissions,
Auditing, and Owner.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs if SNA Server is installed on a Windows NT Server that has a
computer name containing 15 characters.

When shared memory is being initialized, the GetComputerName() application
programming interface (API) call tries to null-terminate the computer name
string it writes to the shared memory Cfgbox field. This field is 15 bytes long,
as it should be, but that is one byte too short to hold the 15- character
computer name plus the null character. Therefore, the API GetComputerName()
returns without writing the string at all, leaving the field full of zeroes.


RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated the file <snaroot>\SYSTEM\SNABASE.EXE to correct
this problem.

To work around this problem, install SNA Server on a NT Server with a
computername shorter than 15-characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
