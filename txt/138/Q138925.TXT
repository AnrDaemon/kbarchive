 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows 95

SUMMARY
=======

A pre-determined IP address can be requested from a PPP server when using
Windows 95 or Windows NT to connect through dial up networking or RAS. The IP
address can be accepted or declined by the PPP server. Windows NT displays a

   request denied

message and drops the connection if the address is denied by the PPP server while
Windows 95 does not. Windows 95 will connect normally with no error or status
messages.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT will terminate the connection if the requested address is not
accepted by the PPP server. This is by design. If a Windows 95 client is denied
the requested IP address, it queries the PPP server for a server assigned
address. If an address is available for assignment from the PPP server, Windows
95 accepts the address and continues the connection normally. To verify this,
run Winipcfg from a command prompt after the connection is established and check
the address of the RAS connection to see if it is the address that was
requested.

Use one of the following steps to resolve this problem:

 - Have the Administrator of the PPP server (or the Internet Service Provider)
   verify the settings for your requested address.

 - Edit the RAS or dial-up networking TCP/IP configuration and choose Server
   Assigned IP Address. This is the default setting in both Windows 95 and
   Windows NT.
