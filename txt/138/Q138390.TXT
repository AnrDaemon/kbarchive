PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot find the getnamebyaddr application programming interface (API) after
you configure TN3270 Server to resolve IP addresses to NetBIOS names and this
process fails causing the following event in the system log:

   Event 203: TN3270 server

   Description:
   Windows Sockets API call getnamebyaddr(xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) failed in
   function TCPSessionInitialize with return code WSANO_DATA.

   EXPLANATION
   An unexpected error was encountered on a Windows Sockets API call.

   ACTION
   Record message and contact technical support.

NOTE: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx in the description above represents the IP address.

CAUSE
=====

The API getnamebyaddr does not exist. Instead, Event 203 should refer to the API
call gethostbyaddr.

RESOLUTION
==========


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, evaluate the problem as if the API call
gethostbyaddr is referenced in Event 203.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 2.11. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 U.S. Service Pack.
