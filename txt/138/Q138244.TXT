TITLE   :Printing Fails with "RPC Procedure Call Failed"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

"RPC procedure call failed" error messages accompany the inability to connect to
remote printers or to spool print jobs. Other operations besides printing may
also generate similar RPC-related errors and may be symptoms of the same
problem.

CAUSE
=====

When a multithreaded client is making RPC calls to a server, and the server is
rebooted or the network session with the server is otherwise lost, the client
does not reset the associations to the server when the connection is
reestablished. Thus the problem described here is not likely to be seen in an
environment where network connections are highly reliable.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
