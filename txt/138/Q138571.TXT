TITLE   :NetBIOS Name Resolution Through DNS Fails Using TCP/IP-32
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER::3.11,3.11a,3.11b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, versions 3.11, 3.11a, 3.11b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If a NetBIOS name to be resolved is not in the local DNS, and you are using
TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups 3.11, the NetBIOS name may not traverse up
on the Domain name hierarchy and therefore may not be resolved.

NOTE: Ping, Telnet, and FTP, which uses Host name (Non-NetBIOS names) resolution,
work fine.


RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain the fix mentioned below.

The search order is now as follows:

Assume the computer is named "yourcomputer", and it's DNS domain is configured to
be "group1.company1.com." Also, two extra domain suffixes are configured,
"company2.com" and "company3.com"

Now if you type NET VIEW \\YOURCOMPUTER, dns queries will be tried in the
following order until one works:

 - yourcomputer.group1.company1.com

 - yourcomputer.company1.com

 - yourcomputer.com

 - yourcomputer.company2.com

 - yourcomputer.company3.com

If none of these succeed, then Error 53 appears.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in TCP/IP-32 for Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11b. A fix is in development, but has not been
regression-tested and may be destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft
does not recommend implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product
Support Services for more information on the availability of this fix.
