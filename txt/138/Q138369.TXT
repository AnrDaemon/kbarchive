PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you remove the DriveSpace 3 component of Microsoft Plus!, the DriveSpace
shortcut may no longer appear on the Start menu. If you installed the Windows 95
DriveSpace components before you installed Microsoft Plus!, the Windows 95
DriveSpace components remain on the hard disk, but the shortcut may no longer
appear.

If you did not install the Windows 95 DriveSpace components before you installed
DriveSpace 3, the DriveSpace check box no longer appears on the Windows Setup
tab in the Add/Remove Programs tool after you remove DriveSpace 3, preventing
you from installing the DriveSpace components.

RESOLUTION
==========

Create a new Start menu shortcut for DriveSpace. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Use the right mouse button to click an empty spot on the taskbar, and then
   click Properties on the menu that appears.

2. On the Start Menu Programs tab, click Add.

3. In the Command Line box, type "c:\windows\drvspace.exe" (without the
   quotation marks) , and then click Next.

4. In the "Select folder to place shortcut in" box, click the System Tools
   folder, and then click Next.

5. In the "Select a name for the shortcut" box, type "DriveSpace" (without the
   quotation marks) , and then click Finish.

NOTE: If you did not install the Windows 95 DriveSpace components before you
installed DriveSpace 3 and you cannot install DriveSpace because the DriveSpace
check box is missing, you must reinstall Windows 95 to install DriveSpace.
