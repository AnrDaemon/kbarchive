TITLE   :Memory Leak in SQL Server 6.0 Affects SMS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT running Systems Management Server may experience the following:

 - Gradually run out of virtual memory causing slowed performance.

 - Stopped processing of alerts, jobs, and other critical functions of Systems
   Management Server.

CAUSE
=====

The problems can occur on systems running any one of the following
combinations:

 - Windows NT 3.5x with Systems Management Server 1.1 and SQL 4.21a

 - Windows NT 3.5x with Systems Management Server 1.1 and SQL 6.0

In short, any combination which is using the NTWDBLIB.DLL with a 6.0.x version.

The account being used to connect to SQL Server has an out-of-date password. When
Systems Management Server processes attempt to connect to SQL Server using an
out-of-date password, the SQL 6.0 NTWDBLIB.DLL's dbopen() function leaks 32K.
Because Systems Management Server processes attempt to connect quite often to
perform processing, memory can be consumed at a rapid rate until the system runs
out of virtual memory. The "Unable to allocate virtual memory" error message
appears.


RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid the memory leak, ensure that the password set in SQL matches the
password being used by the Systems Management Server processes. Logon failures
caused by a password problem can render the site inoperable.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SQL Server version
6.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
