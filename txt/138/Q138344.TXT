======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual SourceSafe gives the administrator the ability to configure the system
for shadow directories. A shadow directory is a centralized directory on your
network server that contains all the files in a project. The shadow directory
contains a copy of the most recently checked-in version of each file in the
project. Therefore, it serves as a centralized area to view and compile your
source code.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Setting up shadow directories in Visual SourceSafe is a multiple-step process.
This article shows the SourceSafe administrator how to properly configure the
system for a shadow directory.

Step-by-Step Procedure
----------------------

1. Open the Visual SourceSafe Administrator.

   a. On the Tools menu click Options.

   b. Click the Shadow Directories tab.

   c. Set the project to be shadowed. Use the Browse button if necessary.

   d. Set the directory to which this project will be shadowed.

   e. Set the shadow directory options in the "Files in Shadow Directory"
      section.

   f. Click OK to save these options.

NOTE: Close the Visual SourceSafe Administrator and Explorer before proceeding to
the next step, so changes will take effect.

2. Go to the directory that you set in step 1.d. Delete all files from that
   directory that are in the SourceSafe project that is to be shadowed to that
   directory.

   NOTE: If you are using Visual SourceSafe version 5.0 or later, you can skip
   the next step.

3. Go to the Visual SourceSafe Explorer.

   a. Select the project that was shadowed in the Visual SourceSafe
      Administrator.

   b. Click the Get toolbar button. On the SourceSafe menu, click Get, or press
      CTRL+G to bring up the Get dialog box.

   c. Enter the directory to which the project was shadowed, and click OK.

At this point, a copy of all of the files for the project will be placed in the
shadow directory. Whenever the file is updated in Visual SourceSafe, the file
will be updated in the shadow directory as well.
