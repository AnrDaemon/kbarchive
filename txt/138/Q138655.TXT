-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to highlight the single grid cell in which the mouse
pointer is located. Various other Microsoft Knowledge Base articles already
exist that describe how to produce other grid visual effects, such as
highlighting an entire row or selecting the entire field (cell) upon entry by
using the Format property. The technique described in this article allows the
user to positively identify the cell in which the pointer is currently located.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a form with a data environment, and drag the table onto the form to
   create a grid.

2. In the Grid.Init event, place the following code:

      This.Column1.Text1.SelectedBackColor = RGB(0,255,0)

3. In the Grid.AfterRowColChange event, place the following code:

      MyColumn="Column"+ALLTRIM(STR(nColIndex))
      This.&MyColumn..Text1.SelectedBackColor = RGB(0,255,0)
      This.&MyColumn..Text1.BackColor= This.&MyColumn..Text1.SelectedBackColor

4. Run the Form, and either click a cell or press the TAB key to move into a
   cell. The cell will exhibit the color of the SelectedBackColor of the text
   box that usually is shown only on initial entry into the cell. The highlight
   color generally disappears when you start to type in the cell.
