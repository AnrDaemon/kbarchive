PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95 appscomp kbAppCompatibility

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Norton Utilities 95 and you have enabled the Protected
Recycle Bin feature of Norton Utilities, the amount of free disk space reported
by Windows Explorer and the DIR and CHKDSK commands may be incorrect. The amount
of reported free disk space may greatly exceed the amount of actual free disk
space.

CAUSE
=====

The Protected Recycle Bin feature protects deleted files by copying them to a
hidden folder and maintaining a log file that contains an entry for each file in
the hidden folder. The problem described in this article can occur if the
Protected Recycle Bin encounters an error while attempting to protect a file,
causing an invalid entry to be added to the log file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:

 - Disable the Protected Recycle Bin feature and then restart your computer.

 - You may be able to resolve this problem by emptying the Windows 95 Recycle
   Bin and the Protected Recycle Bin. For information about emptying the
   Protected Recycle Bin, or for additional information about this problem,
   please contact Symantec.
