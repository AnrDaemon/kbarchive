TITLE   :Cannot Add Components from Floppy Disks or CD-ROM
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to add additional components to an existing Windows 95 installation
using the Windows 95 CD-ROM or floppy disks, you may receive the following error
message:

   The file <filename> on Disk-1-Desc could not be found. Setup cannot
   find the specified network path. If the path appears below make sure it is
   correct. Click OK to try copying again.

   Copy files from: <path>

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you originally installed Windows 95 from a shared
network folder created by the Network Setup tool. The Layout.inf file for the
installation refers to uncompressed files in the shared network folder, rather
than to compressed files stored in cabinet files (such as those on the Windows
95 CD-ROM and floppy disks).

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, follow these steps:

1. Rename the Layout.inf file in the Windows\Inf folder.

2. Use the Extract tool to extract a new copy of the Layout.inf file from the
   Precopy2.cab cabinet file to the Windows\Inf folder. For information about
   using the Extract tool, please see the following article in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:

   Q129605 How to Extract Original Compressed Windows Files

3. Run the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel to install the components
   you want.

4. When you are prompted, enter the correct path for the installation media.

NOTE: If you choose to install components that are not included with the floppy
disk version of Windows 95, you will be prompted to provide a different source
for the necessary files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To avoid having to manually enter the path for the installation media each time
you want to add a component, you must change the Setup Source path. For
information about how to do so, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
