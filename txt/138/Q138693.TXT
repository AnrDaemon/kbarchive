TITLE   :FIX: Error Opening .Bsc File from MRU List
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbide kbVC kbVC500fix kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to open a browser database (.bsc) file from Developer Studio's Most
Recently Used (MRU) list under the File menu, may result in an error similar to
this:

   c:\myapp\debug\myapp.bsc
   The file is binary and cannot be read.

This occurs only when the .bsc file was not previously opened by clicking Open on
the File menu since the Developer Studio was restarted.

RESOLUTION
==========

Open the .bsc file by clicking Open on the File menu.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++,
version 5.0.

Visual C++ 5.0 does not automatically load .bsc files, so they do not appear in
the Recent Files List unless they are specifically loaded as binary files.
Visual C++ 5.0 remembers the .bsc file's binary state when it is loaded from the
Recent Files List. No error is generated.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. In the Developer Studio, open any .bsc file by clicking Open on the File
   menu.

2. Close the Developer Studio.

3. Restart the Developer Studio.

4. Select the previously opened .bsc file from the Most Recently Used files
   list. The error occurs.
