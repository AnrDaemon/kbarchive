======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

After you create a custom Network Neighborhood by using the Local
User\Shell\Custom Folders\Custom Network Neighborhood setting in System Policy
Editor, Network Neighborhood stills displays your default workgroup and the
Entire Network icon.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. There are individual settings in System Policy
Editor that prevent the default workgroup and the Entire Network icon from being
displayed in Network Neighborhood.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following steps describe how to prevent the default workgroup and the Entire
Network icon from being displayed in your custom Network Neighborhood.

NOTE: You can edit the registry using System Policy Editor (Poledit.exe)
      or Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Check with your network
      administrator before you make any changes to the registry. Note that
      you should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and
      User.dat) before you edit the registry.

      System Policy Editor is available in the Admin\Apptools\Poledit
      folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM. Use the Add/Remove Programs tool
      in Control Panel to install System Policy Editor.

      System Policy Editor is included in the CD-ROM version of Windows
      95, but not in the floppy disk version. If you are using the floppy
      disk version of Windows 95 and want to use System Policy Editor,
      please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base for
      information about the availability of System Policy Editor:
