TITLE   :Write-Up Does Not Display Slides in Word 95
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Write-Up command in PowerPoint 95, the slides may not appear in
Word 95. The notes will appear correctly, but instead of slide images, you will
have an empty box with resize handles around it. You will also be able to see
the slide images from print preview.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem may occur because the picture placeholders in Word 95 have been
enabled. To disable picture placeholders, use the following steps:

1. In Word, click Options on the Tools menu.

2. Click the View tab.

3. Clear the Picture Placeholders check box.

When you change this option, slide images will be put back (you do not have to
exit and restart Word).

To disable this option by default, open the Normal.dot template, change this
option, and save Normal.dot with this update.
