TITLE   :Novell VLM Client Files Not Removed When COMMAND /C Used
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade a computer running Novell's VLM network client to Windows 95,
Setup installs the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks to replace the
real-mode VLM client files, but may not remove the VLM client files if they are
loaded from a batch file other than the Autoexec.bat file.

CAUSE
=====

Setup does not remove the VLM client files if they are loaded from a batch file
that is called using the "command /c <name>.bat" method in the
Autoexec.bat file. Setup does remove the VLM client files if they are called
using the "call <name>.bat" method.

RESOLUTION
==========

You must manually disable (or remark out) the "command /c" command in the
Autoexec.bat file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this issue and will post additional information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MS-DOS CALL command was introduced in MS-DOS version 3.3. This command is
used to call a batch file from another batch file. The CALL command replaces the
older method of calling a batch file with the "command /c" command.

Windows 95 Setup does not recognize the older "command /c" command.
