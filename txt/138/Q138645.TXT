TITLE   :PPT7: Can't Open PowerPoint Files with Windows 95 Quick View
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbinterop kbusage

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you right-click a PowerPoint 97 presentation and then click Quick View on the
menu that appears, you receive the following error message:

   There is no viewer capable of viewing Microsoft PowerPoint Presentation
   files.

CAUSE
=====

The Quick View program that ships with Windows 95 works only with PowerPoint 4.0
presentations. You cannot use the Quick View program with PowerPoint for Windows
95 presentations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 95 offers a feature called Quick View, which allows you to view files
created in popular Windows-based programs without starting the program.

PowerPoint does support a context menu option to run a slide show, however. When
you context click a PowerPoint presentation in Windows 95, you can choose Open,
New, Print, Show, or Quick View.

The Show option launches your presentation directly to a slide Show. You can
press ESC at any time, and when you do so, the file is closed. This option takes
longer than Quick View because it actually opens the file.
