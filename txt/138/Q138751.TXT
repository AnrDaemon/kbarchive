SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows 95 Netware Login script processor fails to process a CAPTURE command
for a print queue on the Netware Network. When this happens, the login script
processor returns the following error message:

   Auto Endcap has been disabled.
   An unknown flag name was encountered.
   Usage; Capture /Show /Job=Jobname /Server=Fileserver
   /Queue=Queuename /Local=N /Form=Form or N
   /Create=Path /Copies=N (1-255) /Timeout=N /Keep
   /Tabs=n (1-18) /No Tabs /Banner=Bannername /Name=Name
   /No Banner /Formfeed /No Formfeed /AutoEndCap /No AutoEnd
   /Notify /No Notify /Domain=Domain /EndCapture /Cancel /All
   Automatic EndCap has been disabled

The login process then continues as expected.

CAUSE
=====

The S_LOGIN environment variable in the login script has not been set.

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: The following edits to the Netware Login script can only be performed by a
user with the correct Netware privileges enabled.

To resolve this problem, edit the login script and verify that the following line
is placed at the very beginning of the login script:

   dos set S_LOGIN="%LOGIN_NAME

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information about configuring your Netware login script, contact your
Netware administrator or Novell.
