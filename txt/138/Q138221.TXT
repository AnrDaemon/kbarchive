SYMPTOMS

When you install Windows NT 3.51 or 4.0 on a DEC Alpha computer and want to
format and partition your hard disk before performing the installation, do not
use the Arcinst.exe utility that is supplied on the compact disc. When you use
this version of Arcinst.exe, all partitions are created as system partitions.
This causes an error when you try to install Windows NT.

   5. Type Systempartition and press ENTER.

   6. Press the HOME key, and then press the DELETE key to remove everything on
      the line up to and including the last semicolon.

   7. Press ENTER, and then press ESC.
