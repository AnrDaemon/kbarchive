The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0

SUMMARY
=======

Sometimes when running a form in Visual FoxPro, you may need to place wording on
the desktop instead of in a form. This is useful when you need to check the
results of a variable or other object when building the form. If a question mark
or @ SAY command is used to display the value of something, by default it will
show up in the form that is currently running. But if a _SCREEN.SHOW command is
placed in the code before the question mark or @..SAY command, the results of
those commands will display on the desktop.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the Click event of a command button of a form, place the following code:

      _SCREEN.SHOW
      ? Thisform.Command1.Caption

When you run the form and click the command button, note that the caption of the
command button is placed on the desktop. The form may have to be moved to see
the text on the desktop. Along with question mark and @ SAY commands, DISPLAY
STRUCTURE or DISPLAY MEMORY commands can be used to display information on the
desktop.

The ACTIVATE SCREEN command will also work. It is a backward compatiable command
that was used in earlier versions of FoxPro.
