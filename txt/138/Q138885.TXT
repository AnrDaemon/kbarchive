SYMPTOMS
========

When you run one of programs listed at the top of this article, you may
experience a general slowdown during video sequences and transitions.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs if your video display is set to a color depth of more than 256
colors.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, change your display to 256 colors. Use the appropriate
steps below for your version of Windows.

Windows 95/98
-------------

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Display, and then click the Settings tab.

3. In the Color Palette or Colors box, click 256 Color, and then click OK.

4. Click Yes to restart the computer.

Windows 3.x
-----------

1. Make a copy of the System.ini file, located in your Windows directory. For
   more information about how to accomplish this task in Windows, see your
   Windows printed documentation or online help.

2. Run Windows Setup, located in the Main group, and make a note of which video
   driver appears on the Display line.

3. On the Options menu, click Change System Settings. There should be a few
   drivers listed whose names are similar to the one you just made a note of.
   Select the driver that specifies 256 colors. Click OK.

4. Restart Windows.

NOTE: Some display drivers change the resolution and color depth from a separate
control panel rather than by the methods described above. If this is the case,
see the documentation that should have been included with the video card for
instructions on how to perform the actions described above.
