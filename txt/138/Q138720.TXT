SUMMARY

This article explains how to replace the Microsoft Exchange Standard
Read/Compose Note editor with Microsoft Word for Windows 95 version 7.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Microsoft Exchange is already installed and running on the system when
Microsoft Word for Windows 95 version 7.0 is installed, and the WordMail option
is one of the selected components, Microsoft Word will be enabled as the
Exchange editor by default.

If Microsoft Exchange is not set up when Microsoft Word is installed, the option
to use Microsoft Word as the Exchange editor is available but not enabled. To
enable Microsoft Word as the Exchange editor, follow these steps:

1. Start Exchange.

2. On the Compose menu, click WordMail Options.

3. Click to select Enable Word as Email Editor.

If the WordMail Options menu item is not available, WordMail may not have been a
selected component during the installation of Microsoft Word 7.0. To install
WordMail, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.

3. Click the Install/Uninstall tab, highlight Microsoft Office, and then click
   Add/Remove.

4. In the Office Setup Wizard, click Add/Remove.

5. Highlight Microsoft Word, and click Change Option.

6. Click to select WordMail, and then click OK.

This installation adds the WordMail Options to the Compose menu. This menu item
allows you to select, add, and edit Microsoft Word templates for use with email
and to set Microsoft Word as your default email editor. For more information
about WordMail components, please check the documentation or the help file in
Microsoft Word.
