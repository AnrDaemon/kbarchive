SYMPTOMS
========

When you dial using a calling card that is configured to use the "Wait for
second dial tone" (or "W") dialing rule, the modem may stop dialing.

CAUSE
=====

The "W" dialing rule causes the modem to wait for a second dial tone. Some
modems may not recognize the second dial tone, causing the modem to wait
indefinitely.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Modems icon.

2. Click Dialing Properties.

3. Click Change to edit the properties for the calling card.

4. Click New, type a name for the custom calling card, and then click OK.

5. Click Advanced.

6. Edit the dialing rules. Replace all instances of "W" with four commas. You
   can adjust the number of commas as is appropriate for your modem.

   NOTE: Commas may not be necessary on some digital lines.

7. Click Close or OK until you return to Control Panel.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For almost all modems, a comma (,) defaults to a 2-second pause in the dialing
process. You can adjust the number of commas for a longer or shorter pause.

You can also adjust the default pause length produced by a comma on most modems
by using the "ATS8=<n>" command, where <n> is the number of seconds
(from 0 to 255) the dialing process pauses for each comma. To add this setting,
double-click Modems in Control Panel, click your modem, click Properties, click
Advanced on the Connection tab, and type the command in the Extra Settings box.
