New Features in Compaq NT SSD Version 1.16 Pass B
-------------------------------------------------

Compaq On-Line Recovery Server Option:

New support that provides automated switch over for pairs of Compaq servers
connected via a serial link. The system is composed of the Compaq ProLiant
Storage, Recovery Server switch and the On-Line Recovery agent. If one system
fails, the surviving server detects the failure and causes the switch of the
drives from the failed server to itself. This feature is listed in the SSD as
option line-item Compaq On-Line Recovery Server.
