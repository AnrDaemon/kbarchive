TITLE   :PRB: Modifying a Remote View Results in a Syntax Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp300 kbMDAC250

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you create a remote view to gain access to a remote data source through
ODBC, any attempt to modify the remote view results in a Syntax Error.

CAUSE
=====

One or more of the field names in the tables included in the remote view
contains a space or other special character, such as one of the following:

   ~ !

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not add tables that have spaces in field names to a remote view. Use the
underscore (_) character in place of a space. Alternatively, use the CREATE SQL
VIEW command to modify the remote view. Follow the same naming conventions used
for table and field names.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual FoxPro does not support tables that have field names that contain spaces
whether they are local or remote tables. The only reason Visual FoxPro sometimes
works with spaces in field names is because of the SQL parsing mechanism used.

This behavior depends on the ODBC driver being used to gain access to the remote
data. If you experience these errors when attempting to modify a remote view,
ensure that none of the field names in the remote view contains a space.
