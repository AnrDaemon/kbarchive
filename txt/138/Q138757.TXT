======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In a distributed application that will be run under Windows 95, you may need to
change the icon so that the executable displays your own icon file instead of
the FoxPro Logo. You can accomplish this by using a reference to the _SCREEN
object. This will also change the title bar icon in a Windows 95 application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The _SCREEN system memory variable specifies properties and methods for the main
Visual FoxPro window. The property that needs to be changed in this case is the
Icon property. To change the icon shown on the screen's title bar, use this
command:

      _SCREEN.ICON = HOME()+"SAMPLES\GRAPHICS\ICONS\FLAG\FLGDEN.ICO"

To show how this works, enter this command in the Command window with Visual
FoxPro running under Windows 95. There is a directory of icons shipped with
Visual FoxPro located in the following directory:

   Vfp\Samples\Graphics\Icons

For more information on the _SCREEN system memory variable, query in the online
Help using _SCREEN.
