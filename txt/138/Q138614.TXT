SUMMARY
=======

The Foxpro.int table is used in international and in cross-platform
applications. It holds code page and collate table information. This article
describes the Foxpro.int file.

MORE INFORMATION
================


The same Foxpro.int file is used by the MS-DOS, Windows, and Macintosh versions
of FoxPro. It is a binary file that is read quickly by FoxPro on startup.

This file is used for culturally-correct sorting. It also tells FoxPro what
characters in the current code page are admissible in different situations
(accented characters are in different positions in different code pages), and it
provides a way to make the translation of data from one code page to another.

This file is fundamental to FoxPro's operation, and the information it contains
is read at startup, before an application is loaded. This file must reside in
the Windows\System directory (the directory that holds the VFP3*.ESL file).

A distributed international application or a cross-platform application must
include the Foxpro.int file in addition to the library files (Foxpro.esl), and
this file must be in the startup directory.

For more information about international applications, please see the Developer's
Guide, "Developing International Applications," Chapter 20.
