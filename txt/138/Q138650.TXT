TITLE   :DOCERR: Setup Shows Incorrect Required Disk Space
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

While setting up Visual FoxPro 3.0, the setup program states that a full
installation of the Professional version requires 107,569K (approximately 105
megabytes). However, a complete installation of Visual FoxPro actually requires
less than that -- between 70 and 80 megabytes of disk space. The setup program
incorrectly calculates the required disk space because some components of the
installation are calculated more than once.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The actual amount of disk space required by Visual FoxPro may vary depending on
the operating system and the shared Microsoft components are already installed.
When installed onto a 16-bit platform, such Windows 3.1 or Windows for
Workgroups, Visual FoxPro installs the Win32s subsystem. This subsystem is not
required on 32-bit platforms. Also, the setup program may or may not install
Microsoft Graph and the spelling checker. These components may already be
present on the computer due to a previous installation of a Microsoft Office
product.

Setup may also report that the Space Available is less than the Space Required
but setup allows the user to proceed with the installation. For more information
