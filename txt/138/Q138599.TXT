TITLE   :Identical Resources Open for Two Accounts in Server Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When two accounts (one as a service and another as a user) are locally logged on
to a Windows NT computer and you use NET USE to connect to a local share, Server
Manager displays identical connections (resources) for both accounts. For
example, if REPL logs on as a service when an administrator logs on and issues
the following command and then views Server Manager's User Sessions for the
computer, both administrator and REPL are displayed with identical open
resources:

   NET USE * \\<server name>\<local share or C$>


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Server versions 3.51 and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
