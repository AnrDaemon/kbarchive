TITLE   :FIX: Memory Leak When Scroll Database Designer in Windows 95
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:3.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenvkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual FoxPro, scrolling in the Database Designer decreases the amount of
available System and GDI resources. If available resources fall below 10% you
receive this message:

   Ninety percent or more of your system resources are in use. To free up system
   resources, quit any programs that you are not using. If you do not, your
   computer may stop responding.

If resources are not released and continue to fall, you receive this error
message:

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down. If the
   problem persists, contact the program vendor.

WORKAROUND
==========

Close the files you're currently working with, and restart Visual FoxPro to
release system resources. Wherever possible, avoid scrolling in the Database
Designer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual FoxPro 3.0b
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Scroll in the Database Designer while running the Resource Meter that is
   shipped with Windows 95. You will see the System and GDI resources decrease.
   To find the Resource Meter, on the Start menu, click Programs, then click
   Accessories, and click System Tools. Click Resource Meter to put an icon in
   the lower-right corner of your screen. Double-click this icon to see the
   Resource Meter window.

2. Open the database designer and use the scroll bars to move up and down in the
   Database Designer. The amount of memory that is lost each time you scroll
   depends on the number of tables you have in your Database Designer window.
