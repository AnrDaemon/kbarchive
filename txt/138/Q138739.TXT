TITLE   :Service Pack 2 Upgrade Causes Macintosh Volumes Not To Appear
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack 2, the Macintosh volumes in
Services for Macintosh do not appear and a red "X" is marked next to the volume
icon. In addition, the following system event appears in the Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 12035
   Description:
   Volume information for "<volume name>" could not be loaded. Setting
   defaults.

CAUSE
=====

The volume catalog database format has changed in Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack
2.

RESOLUTION
==========

Wait for several minutes or longer after you reboot the server for the first
time. It may take a while for the catalog to appear, because the catalog has to
be built. Subsequent starts of Windows NT 3.51 allow the volume to appear
quicker. The size of the volume and the number of files or directories in the
volume affect the time to build the database. For example, servers with volumes
over 10 gigabytes (GB) may take over an hour for the volume to appear.
