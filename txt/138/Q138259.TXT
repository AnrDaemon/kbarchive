PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51

SYMPTOMS
========

On your computer with a Thomas-Conrad 3045 Arcnet adapter installed, after you
upgrade from Windows NT 3.5 to Windows NT 3.51 and attempt to copy large files
through Gateway Service for NetWare (GSNW) or Client Service for NetWare (CSNW)
to a NetWare 3.11 server, the copy fails and the following error message
appears:

   Cannot access destination drive

You are able to copy small files to the NetWare 3.11 server successfully.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, expand NWRDR.SY_ from the Windows NT 3.5 (not
Windows NT 3.51) compact disc to NWRDR.SYS in the %SystemRoot%\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS
directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
