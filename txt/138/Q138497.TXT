SUMMARY
=======

Many Windows-based applications display a startup screen or splash screen during
the initialization phase of the application. This startup screen provides a
means of displaying information such as product name, product logo, product
version information, company name, and so on. In addition, it gives the user the
perception of quicker application startup time.

This article gives the steps for creating a custom application startup screen
that will display for a specified interval of time during application
initialization. This form will not supress the FoxPro system menu or the FoxPro
title bar when run within an executable file.

Step-by-Step Procedure for Creating a Custom Startup Screen
-----------------------------------------------------------

You can use the Visual FoxPro Forms Designer to create the custom application
startup screen.

1. Create a new form.

2. Set the following properties of the form:

      AutoCenter=.T.
      BorderStyle=1
      Caption=<set the caption to be blank>
      Closable=.F.
      ControlBox=.F.
      MaxButton=.F.
      MinButton=.F.
      Movable=.F.
      WindowType=1

3. Add a timer control to the form.

4. Set the timer's Interval property to the length of time (in milliseconds)
   that the startup screen should display. For example, if the startup screen
   should display for 3 seconds, set the timer's Interval property to 3000.

5. Place the following code in the timer's Timer event:

      ThisForm.Release

6. Add image, label, and other controls to customize the form as needed.

7. Save and run the form.

The form should display for the amount of time specified in the timer's Interval
property and then disappear.

To incorporate this startup screen into an application, add the following code to
the beginning of the applications main program:

      DO FORM <startup screen form name>

Now when the application is run, the startup screen should display for the amount
of time specified in the timer's Interval property.
