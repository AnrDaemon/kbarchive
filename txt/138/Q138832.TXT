TITLE   :How to Enable SNA Server IPX/SPX Clients to Use SPXII
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbprogramming

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

One of the protocols that the SNA Server client server interface uses is native
IPX/SPX. SNA Server can be configured to talk over the improved SPXII protocol.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated the file <SNAROOT>\SYSTEM\SNANW.DLL to correct this
problem.

STATUS
======

This feature is included in the latest U.S. Service Pack for SNA Server for
Windows NT, version 2.11. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query
on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

An improved version of SPX is SPXII. SPXII has the following advantages:

 - SPXII can use the maximum packet size allowable by the network type. On an
   Ethernet LAN, for example, an SPX II packet can be a full 1518 bytes.
   Standard SPX is only capable of sending 576 byte packets.

 - SPXII can use "windowing" where multiple packets can be outstanding at one
   time. It uses negative acknowledgments (NAKs) to indicate that some packets
   were not received. Standard SPX allows only one packet to be outstanding at
   any time.

To enable the newer SPXII protocol to work with SNA Server, add the following
subkey to the registry:

   \Hkey_Local_machine
     \System
       \CurrentControlSet
         \Services
           \SnaBase
             \Parameters
                \SnaSpx

Then, add the following value:

   SPXII:REG_SZ:yes


SPXII has been supported since SNA Server 2.1 with the addition of the registry
entry, but only on Windows NT 3.5/3.51, not on Windows NT 3.1.

Client support is as follows:

 - Windows 95: Enable the same registry entry as above.

 - Windows NT: Enable the same registry entry as above.

 - Windows 3.x and MS-DOS: SPX-II is not Supported on these platforms.
