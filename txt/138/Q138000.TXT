KEYWORDS:win95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to connect to an Attachmate gateway from a Windows 95 workstation,
you may receive the following error message:

   Error 598: Server not found

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur with the following combination of hardware and software:

 - Cisco Model 7000 Router using either software version 10.2.4 or 9.1.7

 - Attachmate Zip! SNA Gateway version 4.0

 - Attachmate for Windows Client version 4.1

The use of a Cisco router with DECNet routing enabled causes the Ethernet address
of the destination gateway workstation to change slightly, resulting in an
invalid address.

This problem also occurs in Windows for Workgroups 3.11.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======
