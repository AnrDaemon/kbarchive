SYMPTOMS

Attempting to append a backup onto the end of a tape containing an existing
backup fails with this message in BACKUP.LOG:

   The tape device reported an error on a request to write data to tape.

   Error reported:
   Bad data.

Event Error 7 may also be logged in the System Log as shown in the Event Viewer.

CAUSE
=====

The firmware version of the Sony SDT 5000 tape drive tested for the Hardware
Compatibility List (HCL) was v3.02. That version is compatible with Windows NT.
The current firmware version, v3.26, is not.

Firmware revision v3.30 fixes this problem under Windows NT.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5, and
3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

The SDT 5000 DAT drive is manufactured by Sony, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
