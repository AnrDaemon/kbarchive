TITLE   :PRB: MOD() with One Negative Number Returns Incorrect Result
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.6a,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6a 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the MOD() function with one negative number and the expected result
is the numerator, FoxPro returns the wrong value. For example, MOD(9,-10)
returns -1. The correct result should be 9.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs because the MOD() function was designed to maintain compatibility
with the dBASE MOD() function, which also returns this result.

NOTE: dBASE is manufactured by Borland International Inc., a vendor independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.

RESOLUTION
==========

Create a function similar to the following and use this function instead of
MOD().

      FUNCTION INTMOD
      PARAMETER x,y         && where x is the numerator, y is the denominator
      z = x - INT(x/y)*y
      RETURN z              && where z is the expected result

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
