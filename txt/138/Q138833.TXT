OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The following changes have been made to the configuration interface (SNACFG.DLL)
so that the SNA Server Administration program loads faster:

1. When the SNA Server configuration file (COM.CFG) is loaded, SNA Server no
   longer verifies that all SNA Server users and 3270 LUs/pools are uniquely
   defined in the configuration file.

2. The handling of SNA Server user record entries has been improved to speed up
   retrieval of user records, when requested by a 3270 emulation program.

STATUS
======
