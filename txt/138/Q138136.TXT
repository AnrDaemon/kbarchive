SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Developer Studio's debugger uses the F11 key as the shortcut key to
step into a function. All past editions of Visual C++ and Codeview used the F8
key as the shortcut key for step into. This article describes how to modify the
keyboard settings so the F8 key can be used to step into functions when
debugging.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two possible ways to change the default key for stepping into a
function. You can change your keyboard compatibility settings to Visual C++ 2.0,
or you can define a custom key assignment for DebugStepInto.

Change Keyboard Compatibility Settings to Visual C++ 2.0
--------------------------------------------------------

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. Click the Compatibility tab, and select the Recommended Options for Visual
   C++ 2.0.

NOTE: If you defined any custom key assignments, you will have to redefine them
because this method resets all key assignments.

Define a Custom Key Assignment for DebugStepInto
------------------------------------------------

1. On the Tools menu, click Customize.

2. On the Keyboard tab, click Text editor, the Edit category, and the SelectChar
   command. Note that this will have the F8 key assigned to it.

3. Select F8, and click the Remove button. Note that if you want to use the
   SelectChar function, you need to assign another key sequence to it.
   CTRL+SHIFT+A was used in Visual C++ 2.0 and is unassigned in Visual C++ 4.0.

4. Select the Main editor, the Debug category, and the DebugStepInto command.

5. Select the Current Key, which is set to F11, and click the Remove button.

6. Click the "Press new shortcut key" edit control. Then press the F8 key, and
   click the Assign button.
