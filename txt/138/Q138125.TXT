The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1

SUMMARY
=======

It may be of value to have replication occur as frequently as possible. For
example, this may be the case when implementing and testing logon scripts.
Replication can be configured to occur a minimum value of one minute.

NOTE: This can significantly increase network traffic, and possibly impact
network performance.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To set the export server's replication interval at it's minimum value of one
minute:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

   \System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Replicator\Parameters

3. Add an entry as follows:

   Value: Interval
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Data(hex): 1

To set the export server's guard time interval, the number of minutes an export
directory must be stable (no change to any files) before being replicated, to
the minimum value of zero:

1. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

   \System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Replicator\Parameters

3. Add an entry as follows:

   Value: GuardTime
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Data(hex): 0

Note: Reducing the guard time to zero while in the process of replicating may
generate error messages in the System Log. This is caused by the system
attempting to access open files.
