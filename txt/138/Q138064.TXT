SUMMARY
=======

A Visual Basic OLE server can be of three types:

 - 32-bit InProc Server (32-bit .dll)

 - 32-bit Local Server (32-bit .exe)

 - 16-bit Local Server (16-bit .exe)

This article summarizes the order in which OLE servers are searched when a client
makes a call to a server that has all three possible types registered on the
computer. This search order depends on whether the client was a 32-bit or a
16-bit Windows-based application. The first type of server found in the search
order is the one that is started
