SUMMARY
=======

ComboBoxes with a RowSourceType of Value are used quite frequently for lists
that have a defined number of choices. However, there are times when you may
want to add what the user types into the combo box to the list. This can be done
programmatically by using the RowSource Property.

================

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Open the Forms Designer, and place a combo box and text box on the form.

2. With the combo box selected, click the Data tab in the Properties window. Set
   the RowSourceType property to Value (1), and set the RowSource Property to:

   " Choice1,Choice2 " (without the quotation marks)

3. Click the Methods tab, double-click the LostFocus event, and place the
   following code in the LostFocus event:

      IF NOT(This.DisplayValue$This.RowSource)
         This.RowSource = This.RowSource + "," + This.DisplayValue
      ENDIF

4. Run the form.

5. In the combo box, type "Choice3" (without the quotation marks) and press
   ENTER. Choice3 should now be part of the list.

There are two important notes about this example. The first is that the item will
only exist in the list as long as the form is running. Once you quit the form,
the item will be removed from the list. The second is that there is a
255-characters limit to the length of the string that makes up the RowSource.
