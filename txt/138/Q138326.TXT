======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 2.1, 2.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

As shipped on the 32-bit Edition Visual C++ CD-ROM compact disc, the Mfc.bsc
browser database lacks information for the new MFC common control classes. This
article describes the steps necessary to build the browse information for these
new classes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Follow this procedure:

1. Verify that you have at least 90 megabytes of free disk space on the drive
   where Visual C++ is installed. This much space is required to build the
   browse information. 86 megabytes can be freed once the browser database has
   been built.

2. Make a backup copy of the Makefile in Msvc20\Mfc\Src so that it can be easily
   restored.

3. Edit the Makefile to include the new common controls classes:

   Change this line:

         $D\winctrl1.obj $D\winbtn.obj \ 

   to this:

         $D\winctrl1.obj $D\winctrl2.obj $D\winbtn.obj \ 

4. On some Visual C++ version 2.20 compact discs, the Appui3.cpp file contains
   an error. View the Appui3.cpp file that was installed in your Msvc20\Mfc\Src
   directory, and remove any characters that appear before the // (that is, the
   start of the comment) on the first line.

5. From a Command Prompt, run the \Msvc20\Bin\Vcvars32.Bat file to set the
   proper environment variables.

6. Change to the \Msvc20\Mfc\Src directory, and build the browse information by
   running the NMAKE tool:

      nmake browseonly=1 no_pch=1

7. Provided you do not plan to rebuild the browse database frequently, remove
   all files in the $NWD directory, and then remove the directory itself. The
   intermediate .sbr files occupy roughly 54 megabytes of disk space and are not
   required to use the browser.

8. If you want, rename the new browse file from NafxcWD.bsc to Mfc.bsc.

To use the browser file, start Visual C++, and on the File menu, click Open. Then
choose the .BSC file that you just created. The Browser window will appear, and
you can then look up any of the MFC functions or data variables including the
common control classes such as CListCtrl.

Please refer to Chapter 13 of the Visual C++ User's Guide in Books Online for
information on how to effectively use the browser.
