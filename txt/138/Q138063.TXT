SUMMARY
=======

A DoEvents statement inside a inproc OLE server might cause reentrancy problems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you make a call to an inproc OLE server by say, clicking a command button on
a form on some client and that call uses DoEvents, Visual Basic will yield to
process other pending messages. If now due to some user action another inproc
call or the same one is made to the same DLL server, there is nothing to prevent
the DLL code from being re-entered. This might cause unforeseen problems
depending on the situation, so this scenario is best avoided. Another problem
with DoEvents in a DLL is that you are processing messages for the host (.exe
file) in your message loop. The host may have special code in its message loop
to handle some messages, and problems may occur when this code is not executed.
