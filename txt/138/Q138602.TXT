SUMMARY
=======

If the contents of a list box exceed what the list box can display without
scrolling, you can only scroll to the last item in the list. If the contents of
the list box display entirely in the list box, scrolling down and past the last
item cycles the highlight bar back up to the first item in the list.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The scrolling behavior of a list box depends on the physical dimensions of the
listbox. The following program demonstrates this behavior:

   *-- Instantiate a form based on custom form class, TestForm.
   frmMyForm = CREATEOBJECT("TestForm")
   frmMyForm.show

   READ EVENTS

   *-- Define a custom class based on the FORM baseclass.
   DEFINE CLASS TestForm AS FORM
        CAPTION     = "List Test"
        AUTOCENTER  = .T.
        HEIGHT      = 190
        WIDTH       = 300

   *-- Add list box to the form.
        ADD OBJECT List1 AS LISTBOX ;
             WITH ;
             TOP            = 24, ;
             LEFT           = 24, ;
             HEIGHT         = 110, ;
             WIDTH          = 130, ;
             CAPTION        = "Next"

   *-- Add command button to exit the program (form).
        ADD OBJECT cmdQuit AS COMMANDBUTTON ;
             WITH ;
             TOP            = 60, ;
             LEFT           = 180, ;
             HEIGHT         = 29, ;
             WIDTH          = 100, ;
             CAPTION        = "Quit"

   *-- Add custom code to the Init event of the form.
        PROCEDURE Init
             THIS.LIST1.AddItem('One')
             THIS.LIST1.AddItem('Two')
             THIS.LIST1.AddItem('Three')
             THIS.LIST1.AddItem('Four')
             THIS.LIST1.AddItem('Five')
             THIS.LIST1.AddItem('Six')
        ENDPROC

   *-- Add custom code to the Click event of cmdQuit.
        PROCEDURE cmdQuit.click
             THISFORM.Release
             CLEAR EVENTS
        ENDPROC

   ENDDEFINE
   *-- End custom class definition.
   *-- End program.

Run this program. With the current Height property of the list box set to 110,
there is not enough room in the list box to display the entire contents of the
list box. Therefore, when you scroll down to the last item in the list box, the
highlight bar stops on the last item.

To demonstrate the cyclical scrolling behavior, edit the program and change the
Height property of the list box to 120. Then Rerun the program. Scroll down in
the list box and notice that when you reach the last item in the list, the
highlight bar cycles back up to the first item and starts scrolling down again.
