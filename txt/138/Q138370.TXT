-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are trying to connect to a shared network printer, the Network button
in the Connect dialog box may be unavailable, preventing you from connecting to
a network printer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if a port with a nonstandard name is being used on the
local computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to edit the Win.ini file. Edit the LPT
settings in the [Ports] section of the file to read as follows:

      LPT1:=
      LPT2:=

You can add additional ports if necessary.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you cannot connect to a network printer, use Print Manager or the Printers
tool in Control Panel to verify that the port in use has a standard LPTx name.
You cannot connect to shared printers if you are using a nonstandard LPT name
(including LPTx.DOS). Note also that you cannot use COM ports to connect to
network printers.
