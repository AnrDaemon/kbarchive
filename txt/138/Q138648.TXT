SUMMARY
=======

After adding objects to _SCREEN, you can use a CLEAR ALL command to remove the
objects from memory. The CLEAR ALL command removes all objects, variables, and
controls from memory regardless of whether they are scoped to a form or to the
screen.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a form is open when you issue a CLEAR ALL command from the Command window,
the form and all of its objects disappears. If an object is scoped to the screen
with the _SCREEN.ADDOBJECT() command, the object will be cleared from memory,
but the screen will still be available. You can use the _SCREEN.REMOVEOBJECT()
command to remove objects from the screen, but if you use the CLEAR ALL command,
the objects that were scoped to the screen will have to be recreated. These
objects should be created in a procedure or program (.prg) file, so that they
can be recreated after the CLEAR ALL command is issued.
