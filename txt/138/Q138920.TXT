The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Multiple check boxes are often necessary to gather required input. Frequently,
it is desirable to disable the unselected check boxes after the first check box
is selected. The example in this article illustrates how to disable the
unselected check boxes in a form.

Although option (also known as radio) buttons are generally the preferred of
allowing users to make only once choice among a group of choices, this article
provides an alternative method of doing so using check boxes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The form created by the following example contains three check boxes. When a
check box is selected, its Value property is set to 1. After checking the Value
property in the Click event of each individual check box, the Enabled properties
of the remaining check boxes are changed to false (.F.). Changing these
properties disables the check boxes.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a new form, and name it Test.scx.

2. Place three check boxes on the form by using the Form Builder.

3. In the Refresh event of the form, place the following code:

      IF ThisForm.Check1.Enabled=.t. and ThisForm.Check1.Value=1
          ThisForm.Check2.Enabled=.f.
          ThisForm.Check3.Enabled=.f.
      ENDIF

      IF ThisForm.Check2.Enabled=.t. and ThisForm.Check2.Value=1
           ThisForm.Check1.Enabled=.f.
           ThisForm.Check3.Enabled=.f.
      ENDIF

      IF ThisForm.Check3.Enabled=.t. and ThisForm.Check3.Value=1
           ThisForm.Check1.Enabled=.f.
           ThisForm.Check2.Enabled=.f.
      ENDIF

      IF ThisForm.Check1.Enabled=.t. and ThisForm.Check1.Value=0
          ThisForm.Check2.Enabled=.t.
          ThisForm.Check3.Enabled=.t.
      ENDIF

      IF ThisForm.Check2.Enabled=.t. and ThisForm.Check2.Value=0
          ThisForm.Check1.Enabled=.t.
          ThisForm.Check3.Enabled=.t.
      ENDIF

      IF ThisForm.Check3.Enabled=.t. and ThisForm.Check3.Value=0
          ThisForm.Check1.Enabled=.t.
          ThisForm.Check2.Enabled=.t.
      ENDIF

4. In the InteractiveChange event of each check box, add the following line of
   code:

      ThisForm.Refresh

5. If you want the disabled check boxes to appear in a different color, set the
   DisabledBackColor property for each box. The box will automatically change
   color when disabled.

6. Save and run the form.

7. Click any check box to select it, and the remaining check boxes are disabled.
   Click the check box a second time to clear it, and the other check boxes are
   reenabled.

Additional Notes
----------------

 - Changing the BackColor property to gray emulates a disabled check box in
   FoxPro 2.x for Windows.

 - Typing "Help Backcolor" (without the quotation marks) in the Command window
   provides a list of colors and their corresponding numbers.
