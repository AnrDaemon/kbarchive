TITLE   :PRB: Can't Undo After Dragging from One Window to Another
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After dragging from one window to another, if you click Undo on the Edit menu,
only the action of the active window is affected.

CAUSE
=====

The buffers for each window are separate. Therefore, the buffer of a window that
is not active is not affected by Undo. Undo works if the non-active window is
selected, then Undo affects the desired buffer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open a text file in Visual FoxPro's text editor.

2. Select some text with the mouse.

3. Drag that text into the Command window.

4. On the Edit menu, click Undo. The text that was dropped into the Command
   window disappears, but it does not reappear in the window containing the
   original text.

5. Click the window containing the original text.

6. On the Edit menu, click Undo. The text that was originally selected and
   dragged to the Command window reappears in the window containing the original
   text.
