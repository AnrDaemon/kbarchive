======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0, 6.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When building a project from the command line using the following custom macros,
you will encounter undetermined errors.

   MSDevDir
   WkspName
   RemoteTarget

NOTE: For information about these custom macros, please see "Using Argument
Macros" in the Visual C++ Users Guide.

CAUSE
=====

These custom macros are not assigned in the .mak file. For example,

this:

   $(MSDevDir)\bin

expands to this:

   \bin

RESOLUTION
==========

Define these macros in the NMAKE command line to work around this problem. For
example,

   NMAKE /f MyProject.mak MsDevDir=C:\MSDEV<Enter>

Note that the macros are case-sensitive.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Service Pack 5.
