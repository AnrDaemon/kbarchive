TITLE   :Works 4.0 Setup Error: Your Setup Files May Be Damaged
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Works Windows 95 and Bookshelf 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to install Works from the compact disc using the /F switch (code to
force short file names), you receive the following error message:

   Setup Error 997
   Object 130
   Your Setup files may be damaged. Try restarting the Setup program.

This error also occurs if you have performed an administrative installation from
the compact disc, and then try to perform a post-administrative installation
with the /F switch from the administrative installation point.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you use the Works and Bookshelf CD-ROM, you must install Works to a location
that supports long file names.

If you are trying to perform a post-administrative installation to a shared
directory on a server using Novell Netware 3.0 or 4.0, long file names are
supported if the server is configured to use the OS/2 name space (which emulates
a High Performance File System, or HPFS, volume).

For more information on installing the OS/2 name space on a Novell server, see
page 290 of the Microsoft Windows 95 Resource Kit or your Novell documentation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The /F switch is used to install Works using short file names instead of the
default long file names. For example, the switch is used when you install the
program files to a shared drive that cannot support long file names.
