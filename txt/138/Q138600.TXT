TITLE   :Cannot Print Complex Graphical Images on HP LaserJet Printer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:Win2000:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a document that contains complex graphical images to a
non-PostScript Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 4- or 5-series printer, the error
light on the printer may blink and the document may not be printed or the output
may be incomplete or incorrect. The same document may have been printed
correctly in an earlier version of Windows. Documents that contain only text or
simple graphical images are printed correctly.

This problem is known to occur with the following HP LaserJet 4- and 5-series
printers:

 - 4

 - 4M

 - 4 Plus

 - 4M Plus

 - 4L

 - 4ML

 - 4P

 - 4MP

 - 4Si

 - 4Si MX

 - 4V

 - 4MV

 - 5

 - 5P

 - 5MP

CAUSE
=====

The amount of information being sent to the printer by the Windows 95 printer
driver exceeds the amount of installed printer memory. In general, you should be
able to print any document that you could print in Windows 3.1. However, you may
have to make changes to some printer settings as outlined in this article.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Printers icon.

2. Use the right mouse button to click the printer you are using, and then click
   Properties on the menu that appears.

3. On the Details tab, click Spool settings, and then click RAW in the Spool
   Data Format box.

4. On the Graphics tab, click the Use Raster Graphics option.

5. On the Fonts tab, click the Print TrueType As Graphics option.

6. On the Device Options tab, move the Printer Memory Tracking slider all the
   way to the right (to the Aggressive setting).

7. Verify that the Printer Memory setting matches the amount of memory installed
   in the printer.

8. If the Page Protection check box is not unavailable, click the check box to
   clear it if it is selected, or click the check box to select it if it is
   cleared. The check box may be unavailable, depending on the printer model you
   are using and the amount of memory installed in the printer.

9. Click OK.

NOTE: This workaround may cause some documents to be printed more slowly. This
decrease in performance does not occur with all documents or on all computers,
and is typically not noticeable.
