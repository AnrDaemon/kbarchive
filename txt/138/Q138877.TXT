TITLE   :RAS Authentication Retry Dialog Box Skipped
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

On your computer running Windows NT Workstation, when you run Remote Access
Service (RAS) to call a RAS server and you enter an incorrect user name or
password in the RAS Authentication dialog box, the authentication retry dialog
box does not appear if your local logon credentials are the same as the ones
defined for you on the remote network. This is because RAS automatically
compares your local logon credentials to the remote credentials if you initially
enter an incorrect user name or password in the RAS Authentication dialog box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To reproduce the problem, run RAS, select the entry for the server you are
calling, choose Edit, and then clear the "Authenticate using current user name
and password" option. Choose Dial and leave the RAS Authentication dialog box
username, password, and Domain fields blank. Now RAS automatically checks
whether your local logon credentials match your remote logon credentials and
proceeds as follows:

 - If they match, RAS grants you access without prompting you with the Retry
   Authentication dialog box.

 - If they differ, the retry authentication dialog box appears and RAS grants
   you access only if you enter the correct remote logon credentials.

NOTE: You may enter any workgroup or domain name you choose in the RAS
Authentication dialog box on a Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51 Workstation. But if you
use a Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51 server as a dial-out RAS client, then you must
enter the appropriate domain or workgroup name associated with the username and
password on the remote network.
