TITLE   :SMS: Err Msg: Incorrect System Version Upgrading to WFW
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPCM smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When you use Microsoft Systems Management Server to upgrade a Windows 3.1 client
computer to Windows for Workgroups, the following error message appears after
executing the Run Command on Workstation package from the Systems Management
Server Package Command Manager application:

   Incorrect System Version

CAUSE
=====

The WINSTART command (referenced in the Windows for Workgroups PDF command
properties) checks the version of Windows files prior to starting the setup
program. Because Package Command Manager sets the current working directory to
the package directory a version mismatch occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========

Relocate the Windows for Workgroups source files to a subdirectory of the
package source and modify the Workstation Command Line "Automated Setup for
Windows/WFW Client" within the Command Line Properties of the Windows for
Workgroups Package definition.

For example, if the source files are located in the WFW\WFW311 subdirectory,
modify the command line as follows:

   winstart wfw311\setup /h:setup.shh

This causes Package Command Manager to set the working directory to \WFW and
makes WINSTART first check the Windows version there. Upon finding no files, it
searches the system path and finds the correct Windows version.

NOTE: For NetWare clients and Windows for Workgroups 3.1 clients, append the
/LOCAL switch to the above command as follows:

   winstart wfw311\setup /h:setup.shh /local

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.0. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.1
