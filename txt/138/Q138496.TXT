SUMMARY
=======

If you override the event code of a control in a container class, you can call
the control's events by using the Class property of the container, the scope
resolution operator, and the Name property of the contained control:

      ContainerClass::ControlName.EventName()

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, if you choose to add text buttons to a form using the Form Wizard,
a container class based on Txtbtn in Wizstyle.vcx is added to the form. To add
additional code to the Next button while preserving the original functionality
of the button, include the following line in the cmdNext Click event code
window:

      txtbtn::cmdNext.Click()
