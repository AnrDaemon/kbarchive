SYMPTOMS
========

In 3D Movie Maker, when you record a path using the plane, and use the UP ARROW
key and DOWN ARROW key to raise and lower the plane's elevation, the plane
attempts to orient itself, but instead flips over.

The symptoms may also occur if you are moving an actor up or down when performing
the "At Rest" or "Fly" actions.

STATUS
======

This is by design.

When the plane or actors follow a recorded path, they attempt to orient
themselves on three axis. This may occur with At Rest and Fly actions for actors
and during the plane's "At Rest" action.
