TITLE   :PRB: No Event Fires as Focus Moves Out of a System Window
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an interactive user of Microsoft Visual FoxPro moves the focus from one
system window to another system window, no event fires.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. However, developers have requested that an event
fire so that they can tell when the user moves off of a design window such as
the Report Designer. It would be useful to be able to tell if the user saved the
file, and if so, to what name. This feature has been requested as an enhancement
to Microsoft Visual FoxPro.
