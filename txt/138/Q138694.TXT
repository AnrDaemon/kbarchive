======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, 16-bit edition, versions 1.52, 1.52b 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 2.1, 2.2, 4.0, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using a CArchive object with a CSocket can cause an extra FD_READ notification
to be posted when no data is pending. This happens when a block of data is
received through the extraction operator ('>>') or CArchive::Read that is
larger than the current buffer size of the CArchive object.

This can cause OnReceive to be called when no data is present, which will cause
the application to hang indefinitely if a subsequent call to Receive is made.

CAUSE
=====

The CArchive class automatically buffers data reads and writes. If a call is
made to retrieve a block of data larger than the CArchive object's buffer size,
then the CArchive class will make two calls to retrieve the data in buffer-size
blocks.

When CSocket is used, the end result is two calls to the Receive function. The
first call to Receive does not retrieve all of the data currently in the
socket's buffer, so the Windows Sockets DLL posts an additional FD_READ
notification after this first call. Although the second call to Receive might
get the rest of the data from the buffer, the FD_READ notification has already
been posted and OnReceive will end up being called later even though there is no
data left to read on the socket.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure there is data in the socket's buffer using CAsyncSocket::IOCtl()
before attempting to receive.

   void CMySocket::OnReceive(int nErrorCode)
   {
     // TODO: Do some error handling on nErrorCode

     DWORD dwBytes;
     VERIFY(IOCtl(FIONREAD, &dwBytes));
     if (0 == dwBytes) // if nothing to read, return
       return;

     do
     {

       // Read your data from your CArchive object

       CString strData;
       m_pMyArchive >> strData;

     } while(!m_pMyArchive->IsBufferEmpty());
   }

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was fixed in Visual C++ version 4.2.
