 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Plus! Setup, or add a Microsoft Plus! component, on a
computer with mapped network drives, the network drives are available for
installing Microsoft Plus! components. However, installing Microsoft Plus! over
a network or to an existing mapped network drive is not a supported option.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95,
version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Many of the Microsoft Plus! components are dependent on the computer's physical
working directory. These components include Dial-Up Networking Server, The
Microsoft Network version 1.05, and Compression Agent.
