SUMMARY
=======

The Report Writer in Visual FoxPro saves specific printer settings in the .frx
file. Sometimes, a user may want the report to always print to the default
Windows printer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following steps will remove specific printer settings from the report file:

1. Open the report as a table:

      USE MYREPORT.FRX

2. Locate the record that holds the printer information:

      LOCATE FOR Objtype = 1 AND Objcode = 53

3. Remove the printer settings:

      REPLACE Tag  WITH ""
      REPLACE Tag2 WITH ""
      REPLACE Expr WITH ""

4. Close the report table:

      USE

At this point, the printer settings have been removed, and REPORT FORM will
always print to the default Windows printer.
