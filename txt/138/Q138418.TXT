SYMPTOMS
========

When you click Open on the File menu, Word shows documents available on the
desktop or in the root directory of drive C, even though the Document Path
setting points to a network drive.

Changing the Documents setting in the File Locations tab of the Options dialog
box (on the Tools menu, click Options) does not change this behavior.

This happens on LANtastic and NFS (UNIX) networks.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, map the network drive to a drive letter. Then, use
the RegOptions macro to reset the default document location. To do this, follow
these steps:

1. Map the network drive to a drive letter.

2. Use the RegOptions macro to reset the default document location:

   a. On the Tools menu, click Templates And Add-ins.

   b. Click Add.

   c. Change to the Macros subfolder. This directory is typically C:\Program
      Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Macros.

   d. Select the Support8.dot file and click OK. This step adds the Support8
      template to the "Global Templates and Add-ins" box. Click OK.

   e. On the Tools menu, point to Macro and click Macros.

   f. In the Macros In list, click "Support8.dot (global template)." In the
      Macro Name list, click RegOptions and then click Run.

   g. On the Word 8.0 Options tab, click Doc-Path in the Option list.

   h. In the Setting box, type the path to the network location (for example,
      G:\user\mydocs).

   i. Click OK.
