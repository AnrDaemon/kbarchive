SUMMARY
=======

Visual Basic 4.0 introduces a new control called the ImageList control that
holds an array of pictures or icons. Although this control is primarily used by
other controls, such as the TreeView and Toolbar control, that require an image
list control, it can be used to simply store pictures for your graphics methods.
PaintPicture can be used with the image list control to paint a picture onto a
picture box or form. The example in this article demonstrates how to use the
image list control as a stand-alone image repository.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

To create a new application that prints all of the pictures in an image list
control to the form, follow these steps:

1. Place a command button and image list control on a form.

2. Load the image list control with several images.

3. Add the following code to the Click event of the command button:

      Private Sub Command1_Click()
          Dim i As Integer
          AutoRedraw = True
          ScaleMode = vbPixels
          With ImageList1
              For i = 1 To .ListImages.Count
                  PaintPicture .ListImages(i).Picture, 0, i * .ImageHeight
              Next i
          End With
      End Sub

4. Run the project, and click the command button.
