SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual FoxPro, a converter is launched if you create a new form by using the
MODIFY FORM command or create a new report by using the MODIFY REPORT command,
and you use a reserved device name such as COM1, COM2, LPT1, or LPT2 as the
name. Clicking the Continue button in the Converter dialog box to bring up the
next dialog box, clicking the Yes button, and then pressing the ESC key may
cause an Illegal Operation, termination of FoxPro, or cause the computer to hang
(stop responding).

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not use a reserved device name as a filename.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION

When you create a new form or report by clicking New on the File menu, and then
try to save it to a reserved device name, the correct error message appears:

   The filename is a reserved device name. Use a different filename.

   " Modify Report com1.

   The report Converter launches. " (without the quotation marks)

2. Click the Continue button to enter the next dialog box.
