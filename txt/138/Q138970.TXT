======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft SNA Server includes the NetView Alerter (NVAlert) and NetView Run
Command (NVRunCmd) services. The NVAlert service is used to send predefined
Windows NT events to NetView; NVRunCmd is used to allow a NetView host operator
to send commands to Windows NT. By default, these services use the United States
(037) host code page.

The host code page used by these services can be changed by setting the host code
page within the SNA Server Windows NT 3270 applet. This must be done on the
server where these services are run. The NVAlert and NVRunCmd services look for
the 3270 emulator's configured host code page to determine the host code page to
be used.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The SNA Server Windows NT 3270 applet's host code page setting is configured in
the "Host code page" listbox within the 3270 applet's Session / Session
Configuration dialog. The following host code pages can be selected:

Australia (037)
Belgium (037)
Canada(English) (037)
Canada(French) (037)
Denmark (277)
Finland (278)
France (297)
Germany (273)
International (500)
Italy (280)
Latin America (284)
Netherlands (037)
Norway (277)
Portugal (037)
Spain (284)
Sweden (278)
Switzerland(French) (500)
Switzerland(German) (500)
United Kingdom (285)
United States (037)

For SNA Server version 3.0, the following host code pages were added to the 3270
applet:

China (935)
Czech Republic (870)
Greece (423)
Greece (875)
Japan (English lower) (931)
Japan (Extended Katakana) (930)
Korea (933)
Taiwan (937)

The default host code page is United States (037). The value chosen here is
written to the [SnaServerWin3270] section of the <ntroot>\WIN.INI file, in
the "LUHostCountry=" parameter. For example:

[SnaServerWin3270] LUHostCountry=Canada(French) (037)

The NVAlert and NVRunCmd services look at this setting to determine the host code
page that they should use.
