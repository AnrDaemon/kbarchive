SYMPTOMS
========

Setup's Remove All option does not delete all files and folders.


CAUSE
=====

By design, the Setup Remove All option does not delete all files and folders. It
does however, free up most of the hard drive space used by these programs.

No folders will be removed by Setup. Files named Mscreate.dir are not removed. In
addition, any files that are created after the initial installation can not be
removed, since they were not installed by Setup.

In addition, any files you might need on subsequent installations will not be
removed by Setup. These include online update information files, and customized
option files.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Manually delete the Mscreate.dir files. These files are created by Setup and
   are not needed after the uninstall process completes.


2. Manually delete any other unwanted folder or files.

For more information about how to perform this task in Windows, see your Windows
printed documentation or online Help.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If there are any files Setup did not originally install into a specific folder,
Remove All will not remove the file. Any file not originally installed by the
Setup routine, and the Mscreate.dir files, remains intact.

For example, the Encarta.ann file is created when Encarta is executed for the
first time. This means if Encarta has been run even one time, the Encarta.ann
file remains even after the uninstall process completes.
