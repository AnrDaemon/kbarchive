SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to restore a backup to its original location, you may receive the
following message:

   An attempt to restore a file failed because the disk file is newer
   than the file being restored.

CAUSE

This behavior can occur if the Overwrite Older Files Only option is enabled.
Backup does not overwrite newer files by default.

RESOLUTION
==========

To disable the Overwrite Older Files Only option, follow these steps:

1. In Backup, click Options on the Settings menu.

2. On the Restore tab, click Overwrite Files in the Advanced Options box. If you
   prefer to be prompted before files are overwritten, click the Prompt Before
   Overwriting Files check box to select it.

3. Click OK.
