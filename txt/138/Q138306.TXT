SUMMARY
=======

The Windows 95 Setup program changes the date and time stamp of some installed
Windows 95 files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Setup changes the date and time stamp of the following files so that they match
the date and time of installation:

Windows folder:

 - Setver.exe

 - Smartdrv.exe

Windows\Command folder:

 - Extract.exe

 - Scandisk.exe

Windows\System folder:

 - Commctrl.dll

 - Commdlg.dll

 - Dskmaint.dll

 - Lzexpand.dll

 - Mini.cab

 - Msprint.dll

 - Mstcp.dll

 - Netapi.dll

 - Netdi.dll

 - Netos.dll

 - Rnasetup.dll

 - Setupx.dll

 - Shell.dll

 - Sysdetmg.dll

 - Ver.dll

When you upgrade an earlier version of Windows to Windows 95, Setup stamps the
.dll files listed above as the earlier version of Windows. When Setup is
finished, it stamps these files as Windows 95 versions (4.0).

The other files listed above are copied directly from the Windows 95 disks or
CD-ROM and not from cabinet files. The file copy process does not preserve the
date and time stamp.
