TITLE   :No Ball on Table in 3D Pinball
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you play 3D Pinball, or click Demo to watch a demonstration, no ball may be
loaded on the table. When this occurs, the flippers, sound, music, and plunger
still work, and the displayed status is "Awaiting deployment."

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur on computers with a faulty math coprocessor, or when an
incompatibility exists between the math coprocessor and an outdated system BIOS.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, disable the math coprocessor in Device Manager. To
do so, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the System icon.

2. On the Device Manager tab, double-click System Devices, and then double-click
   Numeric Data Processor.

3. On the Settings tab, click "Never use the numeric data processor," and then
   click OK.

NOTE: This resolution is a temporary workaround only for 3D Pinball. When you use
the "Never use the numeric data processor" option, you may not be able to run
programs that depend on the use of a math coprocessor.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95,
version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

3D Pinball uses floating-point calculations, and may attempt to use the math
coprocessor if one is present.
