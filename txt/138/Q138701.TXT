SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT does not provide a way to limit the amount of server disk space that
can be allocated to a user. However, it is possible to limit the amount of space
all users can take up on the server hard disk by placing the directories they
can write to or modify on a partition dedicated for that purpose.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It may be desirable to limit the amount of disk space on the server that users
can store personal files on. For example, if a user's directory is on the same
partition as the operating system or applications, the user can create problems
for the operating system or the applications by filling the disk.

To prevent this problem, create a separate partition for user directories. If
this partition run out of space, it generates a "Disk Full" error message, but
does not affect the operating system.
