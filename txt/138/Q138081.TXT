SUMMARY
=======

If you have the Visual C++ developer studio (Msdev.exe) running, you can load an
executable file for the purpose of debugging without loading the associated
workspace.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To load the .exe file, click Open Workspace on the File menu, and enter the name
of the executable including the .exe suffix. The .pdb file must either be at the
location specified by the executable file or must be in the same directory as
the executable file. Source files can be loaded by clicking Open on the File
menu. When you finish debugging, you will be asked if you want to save the
workspace information. This way the files you've loaded will be reloaded in
future debugging sessions.

As in versions 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2, versions 4.0 and 5.0 executables can also be
debugged if loaded as a command line option as in this example:

   MSDEV Test.exe
