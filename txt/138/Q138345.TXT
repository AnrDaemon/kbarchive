TITLE   :PRB: Error "File <filename> Not Found" When Adding Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe400bug kbSSafe500bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the error "File <filename> Not Found" when individually
adding files to Visual SourceSafe when those files have names that contain
spaces.

CAUSE
=====

Visual SourceSafe may not correctly reference the file in the Add Files dialog
box. This is due to the fact that filenames with spaces must be enclosed in
quotation marks in Windows 95 and Windows NT. Visual SourceSafe may not properly
add these quotation marks under certain circumstances.

RESOLUTION
==========

When adding files that have spaces in the names, select the file with the mouse
in the file list or enclose the filename in quotation marks in the File Name
text box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create two files the names of which both contain spaces. Make sure these two
   files are the only files in the directory.

2. Select (highlight) a project in Visual SourceSafe, and press CTRL+A to add
   files.

3. In the Add Files dialog box, select the directory where these two files
   reside.

4. Select the first file, and click Add.

5. Add a comment if you want, and click OK.

6. In the Add Files dialog box, click the Add button again. The file is
   highlighted in the list box as well as in the text box. Notice that the file
   is not enclosed in quotation marks.

7. Click OK when the "File <filename> Not Found" error messages appears.

8. Click the file in the list box. Notice that Visual SourceSafe places
   quotation marks around the filename.

9. Click Add.
