SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT version 3.51 TCP/IP includes a new feature that allows a host to find
out the computer name (host name) that matches a TCP/IP address; this is
possible even if DHCP is being used to dynamically assign TCP/IP addresses.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows Sockets programs use the GetHostByAddr() call to resolve a TCP/IP
address to a computer name. To accomplish this resolution, the Windows NT 3.51
GetHostByAddr() first attempts to look up the computer name by contacting a
domain name server (DNS), if one is configured. If the DNS lookup does not
return a host name, then GetHostByAddr() attempts to resolve the TCP/IP address
to a computer name by using a NetBIOS Node Status Request as defined in
RFC1001/1002. NetBIOS nodes return their name table in response. The
GetHostByAddr() routine parses the name table for the computer name and returns
this to the caller.

This method does not work for hosts that are not NetBIOS-capable. PTR records
(that is address-to-name records) must be added to the DNS for these computers.

Windows NT utility programs such as PING.EXE, TRACERT.EXE, and NETSTAT.EXE use
GetHostByAddr(), so they can take advantage of this feature.
